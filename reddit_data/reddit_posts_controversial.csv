1,Why Derrick Rose is the most overrated player of this Decade,10,acd3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/acd3ek/why_derrick_rose_is_the_most_overrated_player_of/,142,1546595715.0,"Derrick Rose is famous for being the youngest MVP ever. Rose is also infamous for being extremely injury prone. 

Due to Rose's injuries he has gained lots of sympathy over the years. Most of it is deserved, he was an MVP level player whose career got ruined by injuries. 

Rose has always had a large fan base over the years, and because of his injury history, no one really talked negatively about him. (besides injury jokes) 

I have always believed Rose to be overrated, and for little good reason it has always made me annoyed and angry when people talk about him like he was going to be Michael Jordan if he didn't get injured. 

I have kept my stance to myself over the years, since there is no real need for me to bash on a player who hasn't been relevant or healthy for years. 

But this All-Star voting result has pushed me over the edge. 

I get it. It's a popularity contest. Dwayne Wade is #2 in the East, and Kobe Bryant was an all-star starter in a year he was awful. And Rose has been having a comeback season and it is impressive he is playing at a high level after what seemed like the end of his career. 

But I'm here to tell you that it's all good ole nostalgia that is blinding you from the fact that Rose wasn't as good as everyone makes him out to be. 

Let's look at Rose's MVP season, his stats were;
25 PPG, 7.7 APG, 4.1 RPG, 1 SPG, 0.6 BPG, 13.1 Win Shares. 

Since Rose's MVP season in 2010-2011, (last 8 years in the NBA, not including this year), there have been 18 other instances of players averaging a stat line of;
23+ PPG, 5+ APG, 4+ RPG, 13 Win Shares

Those players are;
Lebron (6), Harden (4), Curry (3), Durant (2), Westbrook (2), Butler (1) 

Out of those 19 instances (18 + Rose's MVP season), here are Rose's ranks in each of the following categories;

PPG: 15th
RPG: 19th
APG: Tied 7th 
Win Shares: Tied 18th
SPG: Tied 18th
BPG: Tied 8th
TPG: Tied 6th 
FG%: 15th
3P%: 16th
FT%: Tied 9th
TS%: 19th
PER: 19th
ORTG: 18th
DRTG: Tied 5th 
USG%: 7th 


My point is, Derrick Rose had one great year, which when compared to other MVP caliber players the past decade, wasn't even that great. 

I understand that he was young and had potential to get better, but he is put on a pedestal by some people that he doesn't deserve. 

Jimmy Butler's 2016-2017 year with the Bulls;
23.9 PPG, 5.5 APG, 6.2 RPG 1.9 SPG, 0.4 BPG, 13.8 Win Shares 
Is extremely similar to Rose's MVP season, and I would expect nothing but laughter if I were to ever compare the two in their prime. 

All stats according to Basketball Reference.

I understand this is a controversial topic that will get me a lot of hate, but please if you disagree with me, please try to be polite and present facts as to why I am wrong, instead of just calling me an idiot who knows nothing about basketball.

2,It's amazing how a single call can change a series.,0,38mech,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/38mech/its_amazing_how_a_single_call_can_change_a_series/,272,1433505104.0,"If that Mozgov spin move wasn't called a travel Cavs had a great chance of taking Game 1 in the Oracle. Instead it goes to overtime and Kyrie gets injured again. Unless it's a last second shot ,we often always forget the little things that change so much. Luck is often so important to every single championship.


EDIT: Understand, I'm not saying anything about whether the call was correct or not. Just pondering how 50/50 calls and luck are so crucial but often forgotten. Whether it was a travel or not, the refs need to be more consistent. [Here is an example just from these playoffs](https://youtu.be/rmG8jPo4_Wc?t=176). Late in the game, 40 seconds left, Bulls are down 1 and go up 1 because of this missed call. Jimmy plants his right foot for the spin and the video shows it clearly takes another step. This cements the fact that this type of spin move travel is called inconsistently.",0.48,controversial,2015-06-05 04:51:44
3,Kevin Durant is Overrated,0,vcrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vcrct/kevin_durant_is_overrated/,170,1340263595.0,"I've honestly been thinking this the whole season when people were comparing him to Lebron and saying he deserves MVP, and he might be the better player between the two. Now seeing his effort and Stats throughout the finals I feel comfortable and I think some people will agree with me when I say this.

**ALL DURANT CAN DO EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IS SCORE** 

* Dude is almost 7 feet tall and averaging less then 6 rebounds per game. Last night he had 2 rebounds which is absolutely embarrassing. 

*  He has no court vision. Can't remember the last time I've been amazed by a pass he's thrown, most of his assists come from a jumpshot made by a team mate who happens to be open. He is averaging less then 2 assists for the finals 

* He usually gives a half ass effort trying to get open when a play is drawn for him. I've seen wade who is much shorter then him body him into a terrible position many times. Since Durant can't manage to get open its usually westbrook who has to jack up a terrible shot.

* It has been exposed that Durant is a below average defender. His Mistakes just get erased because he has Serge and Perkins lurking in the paint to stop drives and block shots. Melo is usually called out for his defense but Durant's is worse. I've never seen Melo have to be switched off a man.

I think people who have watched the NBA back in the day will agree when I say that Durant is a watered down prime T-Mac.

Edit: So none of you have actually tried to counter my points and went on about how he's young, and can score and all that. Derrick Rose, Dwight, Rondo, Kevin Love, Westbrook, Griffin etc, are all young and can score. But they bring more to the table then just that. Which is my point. You cant be a top 3 player if all you can do well is score.",0.49,controversial,2012-06-21 00:26:35

At one point the Cavs record without Lebron was 4-18  last year which is a .181 win rate, worse than the worst teams in the league.

He's officially out vs ""El Heat"" tonight so no miraculous return to try and stop the streak and send a pre-playoff message. When does the gushing praise and love for this guy stop?

He's not a great shooter, but he shoots all the time. I bet there's 10-15 guys in the league you could put in his spot and give them the same freedom and ball dominance that could put up similar stats. That's not a superstar, that's a ballhog with handles.

He would not help the Bulls recruit any big free agents 2 summers ago

He was completely shut down by Lebron in the playoffs (as most would be in all fairness) but showed he could not adjust his game

Hasn't won anything of note

Doctors cleared him WEEKS ago. Could you imagine telling your boss you're not going to work even though the doctor said you're not sick anymore? What do you think would happen?

Not that it's game related, but Adidas spent a pretty penny pushing #thereturn, which was clearly just throwing a bunch of cash in the trashcan as there will not be a return.

His teammates play like warriors and give up their bodies and risk injury every night. Every athlete does. Kobe blew the ankle and at least TRIED before coming out of the game. He's supposedly practicing full speed, I'd be pissed if I was his teammate. 

Those same teammates are going to have the Bulls with a very respectable record and in the playoffs without him. Take any other MVP candidate off their team and tell me if you get a similar result (excluding the Heat).

And my all-time favorite: 'the all-star game is not a place for smiling and dancing'. Dude, get over yourself. I know this one has nothing to do with the actual game, but it really made me dislike him. 

When does he stop getting showered with praise without actually doing anything?",0.52,controversial,2013-03-27 18:32:21

Clarkson was a great 6th man off the bench in LA-reduced to catch and shoot.

8,When is the NBA going to start calling offensive fouls on Andrew Bogut??,130,33qbkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33qbkl/when_is_the_nba_going_to_start_calling_offensive/,343,1429924169.0,"The Warriors are practically unwatchable for me.  Almost every single play Bogut sets a screen where he is obviously moving.  It's gotten so rdiculous that he straight up bear hugged Anthony Davis and then, the very next play, grabbed Omer Asik's jersey to the point where it stretch out like a flag.  Both players were in correct defensive position and were so blatantly hindered from making their rotation by Bogut.  Those plays led to an And 1 and a dunk.

I don't expect players to play it clean every play or for refs to catch them every time, but this isn't ""heady basketball,"" or ""using an advantage.""  Those are used when a player gets away with something once a game.  Bogut does stuff like this the majority of the time he is out there.  What he is doing is straight up illegal, and it's ruining the games when the refs don't call it.

The moving screen is impossible to defend because it turns a passive obstacle into an active one.  NBA players are hard enough to defend with somebody acting as an offensive linemen, taking multiple steps to try and hinder your progress.  Holding is even worse, for obvious reasons.  And watching the Warriors, Bogut gets away with this stuff probably 10-20 times a game.

I don't see any possible way that NBA refs can be so consistently bad at calling this stuff.  Something else is happening, because they are definitely turning a blind eye.  An official was looking right at the Bogut/Davis bearhug, called nothing, AD threw a fit (as he should), and 24 second later they ignored another blatant hold.

This isn't an argument that the Pelicans deserved to win, and I'm not a fan of either team, so I have no dog in this fight.  I want to watch good, playoff, basketball.  When I see one of the easiest calls in the game botched over and over and over again, and there's only one perpetrator, it absolutely takes away the entire viewing experience.  I feel cheated that I put a ton of time and money into being a fan this year, and now the league appears to letting a player foul at will without fear of being called for it.

This is ridiculous.  Watch one of Steph's highlight videos, you're bound to see at least 5-6 blatant offensive fouls by Bogut.  If he was doing it every now and again, I'd shrug my shoulders because stuff like that happens.  But, he's doing it consistently.  Game in, game out.  His fouls have to be accounting for significant swings in scoring, as they often lead to baskets (why they're illegal in the first place).  And NBA refs are doing nothing.  I refuse to believe in an NBA that called more offensive fouls on AD than Bogut got in the entire game.  I really don't fault Bogut all that much either.  If they're letting him play like that, he's be a numbskull not to exploit it.

Shameless.  This reeks of WWE and kingmaking by the league.  Different commissioner, same shady shit.  The NBA obviously cares more about profits than the integrity of the game, which is pathetic.

Start calling offensive fouls on Bogut.  The Warriors are good enough with their talent to possibly win a title alone.",0.56,controversial,2015-04-24 18:09:29

1) We have no legacy. The Lakers and Sixers have their legends... Lebron will be facing a clean slate fir the Clippers. 

2) People are talking about Lebron not being able to make it out of the west, well clipper fans are okay with that. I love when my team blows a series lead.

3) Everyone knows Lebron loves overbearing coaches, especially those willing to sign their own son. Welcome aboard. Fuck it... we'll sign Jr. when the time comes. Chances are we'll have a high draft pick.

4) We no longer have a big man. He can create a small ball team and show up the big baller lakers.

5) There will be no Kardashiam curse, as none of the Clipper players have that kind of game. Ben Simmons on the other hand is a goner.

6) CP3's trade actually gave us some assets, which none of us care about long term. Let's give SA the entire team for Kawhi. Who cares either way at this point?

7) Lebron has encountered racism in the past... Clippers happens to be one of the few team to undergo a public transformation in this regard. We are now a safe zone.

8) The stapples center has MANY banners hanging. That building is an example of high caliber play. Three out of the four teams in the stadium have been champions. Lebron should takes those odds... it is better than his current chances against GSW.

- Speaking of rules of the game, it seems this guy is more invested in drawing fouls than actually playing the sport. Hes getting calls that fucking LeBron would dream of getting.


- The Rockets are 25-20, and up until recently theyve had Capela and CP3. Theyre not exactly on a winning streak right now either.


- LeBron, Kyrie, Kobe, Tmac, AD, Giannis, Curry and Durant could ALL score 55+ at Harden's volume, so its really not that historic to me. The only thing historic about it is the amount of shots hes getting from the field and the stripe

12,[Translation] A more moderate analysis from a Chinese NBA fan,20,dezi8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dezi8p/translation_a_more_moderate_analysis_from_a/,299,1570567841.0,"Hi all, I think this post contributes to the conversation by    providing insight into how an average NBA fan in China thinks about the issue. You probably won't agree with a lot of it, but I've always believed that in conflicts like this, instead of discussing within one community, it brings value to better understand how/why the other side takes its stand.

I wanted to share one of the most upvoted response to the question ""How do the clarifying statements from NBA and Morey influence this incident?"", with Redditors who might be interested. This is one of the more moderate reactions (instead of the more extremely nationalist answers). Texts in the parenthesis below are notes of my own.

Original link is from ""Zhihu"", a Chinese site similar to Quora: https://www.zhihu.com/question/349482593/answer/847926460
Disclaimer: The following is excerpted and my translation might not convey the original article in 100% accuracy. 

**Edit: This post understandably became very controversial. I didn't mean to spread ""propaganda"", but I hoped to share how this well-educated Chinese NBA fan took his stand, after analyzing both American and Chinese values.** I think there's value in understanding the other side in a debate. And the other side in this issue aren't all just extreme nationalist crying ""NMSL"". If you don't want to read the original article, I provided some thoughts of my own below and maybe that's more interesting to you. To those of you who did find this thread with interesting information, thanks for the comments and this is reason I translated this article for.

""""""

*To understand NBA's statement, we need to first figure out ""the why"" behind it.*

*In a times of vibrant globalization of NBA, with China being its biggest partner (overseas), the public outburst and conflicts on this issue have grown explosively. The NBA however is making a superficial, ambiguous statement, trying to convert a political discussion into a cultural one.* 

*It's no surprise.*

*I never expected the NBA to issue any fines on Morey, nor will Rockets fire him even if the owner wanted to.* 

*Obviously in this issue, politics position outweighs right or wrong. For China, we have our bottom line (in diplomatic matters related to Hong Kong), while the US has its own political correctness. As the ""candle-stick"" country (this is an interesting reference to US, not sure if the context is clear. Basically it refers to the Book of Mathew in Bible and teases US for its propaganda of western values), the US has its mainstream values and always tries to measure other nation's reality with their own culture and beliefs.* 

*Look at Reddit (yup the author has VPN, as does many others netizens): considerable of American netizens voice support for Morey, just because he advocates ""democracy"" for ""people"", but without realizing Morey offended our sovereignty greatly. They think he just voices an opinion of his and what's wrong with that?*

*In reality, this so-called freedom has evolved into violence. The long-term living conditions of the ""people"" they support, the US doesn't care to understand and this is their arrogance (he's arguing that some American folks just follow the trend without really understand the issue of HK).*

*Thus, it's not hard to understand the attitude of NBA.*

*In US, as long as the bottom line of racial and sexual discrimination is not touched, it's illegal to fine people on their words because of freedom of speech. The NBA in recent years has also been encouraging their stars to comment on progressive affairs, in order to boast its own social and political value. They won't contradict themselves by punishing Morey.*

*If NBA criticizes Morey or Fertitta fires him, this will cause the public opinion to say that ""they chose money over freedom"" or ""does the NBA have the right to take away its employees' opinions?"" Granted they might fear the loss of Chinese market, but the American market is the fundamentals of NBA. It goes without saying which one is prioritized. Thus, Fertitta's saying ""We have the best GM in the league"" (This was taken out of context; I think it was wording before a turn of tone but it's taken as defense for Morey) is not because he ignores the seriousness of the issue, but it's the inevitable development of events.*

*So what's our take on this? I personally think we should stand with what the leadership decides to take.*

*If the state does not ban NBA, it's also not necessary for us to keep bashing (Morey and NBA). Only the uncultured and the boorish shout “perish together” to their end. The NBA is very closely knitted with China's sports industry, be it forums, media, reporters or sports company. Many count on NBA as their income.* 

*I've said this in a group chat, a nation has to protect its sovereignty to develop, but it doesn't mean pushing it too hard.* 

*I don't have the relevant numbers and stats for the sports industry, and don't have a think tank to report on cost-benefit analysis. But I trust that after a full day's silence, the State has a more accurate estimate of developments on this matter, and has planned accordingly. Whether it's forgiving concession or a heavy punch to the NBA, we shall wait and see.*

*Another way to understand this is by thinking in their shoes: if you partner with US but sends a tweet that insults African American, and try to say that ""my country has freedom of speech, and my views do not represent my company"", this most definitely won't be accepted by Americans.*

*At the end of this, one has to contemplate: under David Stern, the Houston Rockets became the barometer and milestone of NBA's Chinese market. This was why the issue was so destructive. Also, if it happened during a less subtle time (China's National Day is Oct 1st), or on a less sensitive topic (sovereignty), or a less important person (GM of the most popular NBA team in China), this matter wound't have expanded like this.*

*Perhaps, the biggest victim in this incident are the Chinese fans who devoted their love to Rockets and NBA.* 

""""""

Tl;dr: Explains why the NBA releases an ambiguous statement since it's bound by western values but still values Chinese market. Provides context of Western universal values and how it clashes with China's sovereignty issues. Points out that ban of NBA harms both sides. Explains why this particular issue exploded so dramatically.

My thoughts: 

1) The author clearly understands a fair amount of American cultural contexts, and explains on the issue from both nations' cultural and political beliefs. It‘s actually a good education for the Chinese public on why the NBA/Rockets/American fans react in their ways. Hopefully this brings more meaningful conversations on this Chinese forum.

2) Has a very good point: China doesn't want to just permanently cut ties because of conflict since China's sports industry also suffers damage if the NBA doesn't flourish in the country.

3) Ultimately I see two clashing fundamental beliefs on the topic freedom of speech. In Western values you can say anything about politics as long as it doesn't touch racial or sexual discrimination. In China, it's deemed the freedom of speech does not protect speech that ""undermines national sovereignty"". The rest of world knows how China is ""petty"" on issues like this, but they might not understand is that China and its netizens treats its sovereignty issues just as seriously as the west treats racial issues. Territorial integrity is its fundamental value and is indoctrinated from grade school, just as racial equality is taught in US educational system. And it's a very successful strategy: *not everyone* agrees with the government's ways, but *everyone* gets fired up on territorial issues. Most Chinese fans genuinely  think it's a double standard to not allow someone criticize a specific race, but supporting ""separatist movement"" is allowed. 
But that's what freedom of speech is, a western person might say. This is why this clash of ideas is so fundamental.

4) In his last sentence, you can tell he really believes the Chinese fans are heart-broken by this issue, despite their angry reactions. And in a way it's true. The NBA has been a progressive, positive influence in China, and even educates the public on matters like racial equality. Fans really treat their franchise players as inspiring role models, and devote lots of emotions into the team. And now out of nowhere Morey posted this comment that's deemed outrageous in the country, and both fanbase despise each other in heated argument, with possibility of NBA being banned. There's definitely emotional loss there. 

For me, the NBA and the Rockets have been great ambassadors (like it or not) in modern China-US relationship due to the influence. It's sad to see them entangled in this position.

Not arguing for any side through this post; meant to share this for some insights. Please correct me on anything that I got wrong. Note: this Zhihu response was obviously written before China goes all in and announces suspension of NBA broadcast, while the OP predicted a less aggressive reaction from the leadership.

The Celtics had Kyrie Iriving coming off a career year regular season, and were not shy about wanting to pair him with Anthony Davis. The Celtics were just as obvious about their want to poach AD, as the Clippers were for Kawhi, the Knicks were for KD and Kyrie, and the Lakers for AD.

So what happened? Instead their season goes down in flames. They lost their best player to the Nets a team that they had crippled 5 years ago. They lost their second best player to their greatest rival in the East. They lost their most prized player AD to the their greatest rival in the Lakers. 

Lets be clear, that is a DISASTROUS off-season! They went from being poised to create the league next champion, to being locked in a decent playoff team for the foreseeable future. 

But, its all okay because they got Kamba Walker? No disrespect because I love Kemba, but if you said you were going to have Ad, Horford, and Kyrie on the same team, and then ended up with a maxed out kemba walker, you FAILED.

It becomes quite easy to determine that Kyrie is not a top six point guard. Obviously placement is debateable, but Westbrook, Steph, CP3, Wall, Harden, and Lillard are all better than Kyrie. And yes, I know ""Kyrie has to share the ball"" but he still takes 3 more shots a game than LeBron and 5 more than Love.
Please dont fuck up my karma im just tired of people saying Kyrie is a top 5 point guard solely  bc he was balling during the finals. They all also have better efficiency ratings.

15,"There is no such thing as a ""clutch"" player...",5,asceds,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/asceds/there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_clutch_player/,222,1550623555.0,"After you're done being upset at the audacity I must have to make such a claim take the time to do a little research, as well as look at the data for yourself.  Clutch moments exist, hitting a game winning shot is in fact clutch.  But clutch players do not - just good / great ones who we mistake their greatness for clutchness.  

&#x200B;

The science suggests that these events are overrated in our memory because there are so few of them and the stakes are much higher that the results from these events stick with us longer and remain more meaningful to our perception.  But that's just a human limitation - not anything real.  Hitting a big shot in a big moment is more of a product of randomness than anything.  With such small sample sizes nothing meaningful can be truly derived from the data, especially without the full picture (i.e. the context behind each attempt).  When these samples grow the picture becomes clearer - the best players tend to perform the best no matter the situation. 

&#x200B;

With all that said I'll leave this data here...a players TS% during ""clutch"" moments from one year to the next (2010-2019).  If clutch were real, wouldn't it be repeatable?  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Each quadrant is split almost 25 / 25 / 25 / 25.  That's pretty remarkable and telling of pure randomness.  Out of the 204 players that are included at least 3x in the data, just 13 (about 6%) were above average each year.  They're exactly who you would consider clutch too - Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Al Horford, Ray Allen, Gordon Hayward, Samuel Dalembert, Amir Johnson, Julius Randle, Kyle Korver, Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, Derrick Favors, and Markieff Morris.  A veritable who's who of the most clutch players in the game.  Or, in all actuality, guys who have limited years (who will eventually fall victim to the random output of ""clutch"" time statistics) or players who were still incredibly inconsistent but are so GD good at shooting that it's hard for them to fall below average (Steph, anyone?).  

&#x200B;

The point is, clutch players don't really exist.  If they did, they could do it over and over and over and we would find it in the data - but it's not there.  I know that many sports fans treasure the idea of players being clutch, so it's hard to admit reality when you don't want to.  But that doesn't make it any less true.  Sorry.

16,Debunking narratives about the Warriors-Rockets 2018 Western Conference finals,114,g7tgd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g7tgd9/debunking_narratives_about_the_warriorsrockets/,306,1587849830.0,"Disclaimer:I am a Knicks fan not a Warriors fan not a Rockets fan I never was a blind hatrer towards Stephen Curry or James Harden and appreciate their greatness, Klay Thompson and PJ Tucker are some of my favorite players as well. Full disclosure I watched every single game and wanted the Rockets to win the series so if that disqualifies me from being what I consider a non-bias observer I’ll take the L. 

To some people narratives are more important than what actually happened. You make a comment you think is noncontroversial next thing you know you have -50 downvotes because it went against a popular narrative. With how some people in the NBA media and Reddit talk about certain events it’s like they didn’t even watch the same game as you. The 2017-18 Rockets had an historic offense and one of the better defenses in the league. They didn’t have the star power Golden State had but they had the right pieces around 2 all NBA caliber players. I’m going to quote some of the popular narratives against this team and attempt to debunk them.

#”Rockets went 0-27 they deserve to lose”

Point 1: even going 0-27 the game was within 6 points with five minutes left in the fourth quarter until Steve Kerr did Hack-a-Capella and the game got out of hand.

Point 2: Why did they shoot so many threes despite them not falling? Because the refereeing, I am NOT arguing if the refs are bias I am trying to stick to only the facts. You can argue with whether bad calls are part of the game and they happen all the time it’s a physical game. What you cannot argue is that refereeing does not affect the outcome of the game. The Rockets were not getting many calls in their favor game 7. The warriors were very physical in the paint this made the Rockets three point shots or attack the basket strategy harder because the Warriors were getting away with contact. That’s what led to the decision of shooting so many threes. Personally I wish James Harden was unleashed and had the green light to shoot mid range shots this game, he used to be elite at it when he took them, and the Warriors defense wouldn’t have game planned around it but this is hindsight. In the moment you probably don’t wanna deviate from what got you there. Also there was a four Point play in the third quarter that was waived off Harden MADE a 3.

Minor point:[There was 4 three point fouls](https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU) on James Harden that game that was missed and if the fouls were called those attempts wouldn’t have counted. I cannot recall if it happened to any other player but I vividly remember it happening to Harden. Missed fouls are a part of the game yes but if there’s a nuanced for that why can’t there be nuanced for 0-27.

#“yeah Chris Paul was injured games seven but Andre Iguodala was injured too. If Andre Iguodala  was healthy it wouldn’t have gone seven”

Point 1: Andre Iguodala was vital to the Warriors One of the best six men in the league at the time and could’ve helped guard Harden yes. However it is absolutely idiotic to compare all star and all NBA caliber player Chris Paul 1 of the best point guards in history and one of the smartest to a 6th man. Chris Paul was the 2nd most important player to the Rockets at best Andre Iguodala 5th most important. But OK let me debunk this one by comparing how each team performed without each player. 

Warriors Playoffs offensive rating when Andre Iguodala is in the game:111.9 

Warriors Playoffs defensive Rating when Andre Iguodala is in the game:98.5

Warriors Offensive rating games 3-7 no Iggy: 109.725(-2.185)

Warriors Defensive rating games 3–7 no Iggy: 101.5(+? 3)

Rockets Playoffs Offensive rating when Cp3 is in the game 109.1

Rockets Playoffs defensive Rating when CP3 is in the  game:102.3

Rockets offensive rating game 6-7 without Chris Paul 96.85(-13.85)

Rockets Defensive rating game 6-7 without Chris Paul 117.15(+?14.85) 

The Warriors without Andre Iguodala were 2.185 points worse without him offensively and 3 points worse defensively. Compare that to the Rockets without Chris Paul 13.85 points worse offensively and 14.85 points worse defensively. It’s laughable to compare the impact of Andre Iguodala to the impact of Chris Paul which leads me to my next point.

Point 2: Why do people pretend like CP3 and Iggy were the only injured players that series? Luc Richard Mbah a Moute unfortunately got injured right before the playoffs and it was never the same. He played some games in the playoffs but it was a shell of himself and because of that it forced the Rockets to play Ryan Anderson. According to advance stats he was the Rockets best defender out of all rotation players who got serious minutes. He and Trevor Ariza had similar importance to the Rockets and he played a vital role in their defense.  Let’s compare all of the injured players stats. Unlike Andre Iguodala and Chris Paul, whose stats were better in the playoffs then in the regular season, I will be using regular season stats for LMaM because injury.

Luc Richard Mbah a Moute Regular season stats:
7.5/3/.9/1.2/.3 on 48.1/36.4/68.4 Win shares 2.8 defensive win shares 2.1 usage 12.8% defensive rating 101.7 and offensive rating 111.4 25.6 minutes a game.

Andre Iguodala playoff stats: 8.1/4.5/2.7/1.4/.5 on 49.4/37.8/70.6 spilts Win shares 1.4 Defensive win shares .7 usage rate of 12.4% defensive Rating of 98.5 and offensive rating of 111.9 26.7 minutes a game.

Chris Paul Playoff stats: 21.1/5.9/5.8/2/.3 WS 2.1 DWS .7 on 45.9/37.4/83 Usage rate 26.2% Offensive rating 109.1 and Defensive Rating 102.3 34.5 minutes game.

According to the stats Andre Iguodala impact was more closer to Luc Richard Mbah they played a similar amount of minutes had a similar usage rate and offensive rating. Iguodala has a better defense of rating and better stats but LMaM had more win shares. Meaning the Rockets lost their second best player and a player who had similar production to Iggy. It’s completely ridiculous to say injuries are awash in the series.

#“The Rockets blew a 3-2 lead Harden is a choker and he can’t lead his team to a championship”

The 2018 Warriors are one of the greatest NBA teams in history that had four All-Stars(Draymonds last year). 2 of the greatest shooters of all time one of which was a top 5 player and 2xMVP with another pretty good shooter who was 7 feet tall and a top 5 MVP player. The Rockets had 1 MVP top 5 player James Harden A 6 man of the year and a bunch of role players(2 of which I’d argue cost them game 7 Ryan Anderson and Clint Capela with FT). It would be ridiculous to think that they could have beaten one of the greatest teams of all time and the craziest thing is they almost did. Let’s only take into account the 4 3 point fouls [that in the moment even the announcers thought were missed fouls](https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU). Including a four-point play that was waived off. Harden is a 88.7% FT shooter so let’s say that’s a possible 11-12/13 extra points the Rockets get final score could’ve been 101-103/4 and that’s not even factoring in points the Warriors lost from fast break opportunities from fouls not being called(IE Klay’s 3 after a miss foul on harden) or game momentum possibly shifting. I’m not arguing if the refs are biased I’m arguing the facts there were missed calls and it cost the Rockets the game. 

Point 2: if the Rockets beat the Warriors which they very much could’ve they are 100% washing the Cavs. The Cavs defense was horrible and it was arguably one of the worst teams ever to make the finals if it wasn’t for LeBron. I’m pretty sure even though Harden hasn’t won a championship you can say he is a caliber player to get you one, he wasn’t just one game away he was a few calls away.

#“Kevin Durant was hurt last year he has no excuses and it proves the Rockets we’re never going to be able to beat the Warriors they need to stop saying if CP3 didn’t get hurt”

I remember hearing that one from Rachel Nichols 

Point 1: Here is the facts you can have the same core and be a worse team. Teams are not stagnant players become better players become worse. Rockets lost Trevor Ariza and LMaM, NeNe was old as hell last year, Chris Paul had a down year, Eric Gordon might have declined, Capela played worse last year. As a result of The Rockets personnel downgrade their switch everything strategy didn’t work and their defense was so much worse than the year before. You also had a owner who was unwilling to improve the team by going into luxury tax. 

Point 2: If it wasn’t for James Harden doing something incredible by going on a rampage and caring his team I doubt the Rockets would have even been in a game 6 against the Warriors. If James harden just replicated his production from his MVP season You could argue that Rockets team doesn’t even make the playoffs with all the injuries and downgrades. I am not trying to disparage LeBron for this next point, I just want to highlight how insane Harden went. Harden did something LeBron couldn’t do that year take a injured team in the west that year to the playoffs Harden elevated the Rockets from the 14th Seed into top 4(if it wasn’t for the nuggets would’ve been 3 1 game from 2)while recovering from an injury. Harden having a historic season included  having the second most steals that season with the most deflections, while averaging the most points since MJ (36)with a 32 game streak of 30+ points. including moments like the game against the Warriors with no CP3 where he hit a clutch three point shot to win the game against Draymond and Klay. Going 21-11 despite Chris Paul and Clint Capela missing time during that stretch season as well. One of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen in a regular season and it completely masked a lot of the Rockets flaws.

Point 3: Now more specifically games 6 You had Andre Iguodala score 17 points on 62.5% from 3 game 6 Klay and Steph going god mode in the second half. Steph scored 33 points 25 in the fourth quarter. Sometimes there is nothing you can do and the better team wins it and the warriors were the better team this year. If it wasn’t for Klay’s injury they could’ve beaten the Raptors and won a championship without Kevin Durant. They were a championship caliber team with or without Kevin Durant there is no shaming and losing to them.

Bonus narratives not related to this series specifically but I’m not making another post for these and might as well address them 

###“Harden sucks at defense”

He is one of the best post defenders in the league was top 5 in steals twice at the very least he’s average to above average.

People don’t seem to take my word for it and they shouldn’t I should’ve elaborated but I got lazy toward the end 

These stats are accurate from March 16, 2019 I am still looking for the end of year stats from 2019

Pts per possession: 1st

FG%: 2nd

eFG% 2nd

Turnover frequency: 1st

Scoring frequency: 1st

This is from this year

[Harden has allowed just 0.65 points per post-up in 2019-20, the second-best mark of 50 players with at least 50 post possessions defended. ](https://www.si.com/nba/rockets/features/grading-james-harden-defensive-performance) He's also been an effective pick-and-roll defender. Harden allows just 0.78 points when defending the ball-handler in a PnR, ranking 31st of the 164 qualified players. Houston often schemes Harden away from the league's top guards, but that caveat doesn't dismiss the metrics. Harden has been an effective defender for significant stretches this season.

###“Harden chokes all the time”

I am not going to pretend Harden does not have bad playoff games he does he has historically bad games at times and has chocked. but all the time? what is choking? If Having a bad game equals choking did Steph Curry choke in game 3 in the 2018 finals? I’d argue no bad games come and go you should look at the totality of the series/playoffs. Some people say Harden choked in the playoffs last year. Harden averaged 34.83/7/5.5/2.16/.5 against the Warriors I don’t know what else he could’ve done that series. Did he have a few turnovers? yeah but if you think a few turnovers was the reason the Rockets lost to the Warriors not the fact that they were inferior team and “harden choked” I don’t know what to say to convince you otherwise. The last time he chocked was game 6 against San Antonio (i’ve heard arguments that he had a concussion but since we don’t have any medical evidence we have to assume it was a choke).",0.57,controversial,2020-04-25 14:23:50

1. I hate that he whines after every call that either (a) doesn't go his way; or (b) goes against him. Especially the face he makes when whining about those calls. 

2. I've always thought he was a boring player (perhaps that's more indicative of the Spurs system from 1999-2011 or so, but I still blame Tim Duncan). Given his boring play, I've never said ""I can't wait to watch Tim Duncan tonight."" Yet even though I dislike other players, such as Lebron, I'm damn sure tuning in to watch him play. 

3. I've always felt like he was incredibly lucky with the situation he was in. For example, if the Spurs had traded their first pick in 1997 (which was used to draft Tim Duncan) for Kevin Garnett, I do not think Tim Duncan becomes ""Tim Duncan."" Given his quiet nature, I doubt his ability to single-handedly carry a franchise like Garnett did in Minnesota. Meanwhile, if Garnett is surrounded by the talent Duncan was during the 2000's, he wins multiple MVP's and more championships than Duncan during that era. 

4. He is friends with Bruce Bowen.

5. While I believe that he is probably more humble than the average NBA player, I think he received the ""humble"" label predominately because of his boring on-court play and the fact that the Spurs, despite winning, were rarely given national attention during the 2000's because they were so boring to watch. Had he played in a major media market, ala Kobe, Iverson, etc., he would likely have received more media scrutiny. With more scrutiny, he might act out in ways that we wouldn't expect (like Durant when he began to receive more media pressure). 

That's all I can think of. Maybe I'm irrational, but although I respect his accomplishments and think he was an excellent player, I'm just not a fan of Tim Duncan. Does that make me a bad person? Am I going to hell?",0.54,controversial,2016-07-13 04:18:05

So why is so much merit being given to the Bucks being #1 in East vs Rox #3 in West despite A LOT more injuries throughout the year to HOU in regards to Giannis MVP campaign?

List of players Harden is up against in the West:

&#x200B;

Lebron, Durant, Curry, Klay, Dame, CJ, DeRozan, PG, Westbrook etc with an INJURED roster. A lot of these guys STAY healthy, and are on playoff teams.

Overall records vs top 10 teams: Rox 14-9 Bucks 12-6 we arent looking at a huge difference here with a decent sample size. And remember the injuries Rockets have faced (Paul, Capela and EG missed a combined 51 games!). The Bucks barely beat Houston without CP3 AND EG too.

I think Harden averaging 40PPG and willing his team up the ranks over 30+ games from 11-14 to the 3rd seed is unprecedented and he should be the MVP.

Not only that, but LeBron seems to have to much say on the organization. From coaching to signing new players, LeBron seems to have all the power. And tbh, if I was a player, I would not want to be in a locker room controlled by one person. And the biggest problem I see is that LeBron has always been good enough to win as a one man show with ridiculous stats, so no one would dare call him out.

22,Reminder: Why Lebron's Supporting Cast Being Bad Is His Fault,208,8lvmpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lvmpl/reminder_why_lebrons_supporting_cast_being_bad_is/,245,1527220551.0,"I was reading this r/nba thread today (1) and I saw everyone excusing Lebron this season stating how ""he can't be wasting his last years of greatness carrying a s*** team"" or ""Lebron would be a fool to stay in Cleveland and waste his prime years on such a s*** team.""

Well, I'm sorry to say, but this ""s*** team"" is Lebron's fault.

After the 2015 NBA Finals, Lebron used his leverage against the front office to re-sign Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson. Iman Shumpert signed for 4 years/40 million (!) dollars. Tristan Thompson was re-signed by the Cavs for 5 years/82 million (!) dollars. This contract is especially crazy because the Cavs were essentially competing against no other teams to sign Thompson. According to this CBS Sports article (2), not a single team stepped forward with a max offer sheet for Thompson to use as leverage in negotiations. Lebron took away all of his GM’s negotiating ability and it resulted in more than 290 million dollars in guaranteed money being handed out that offseason (3). This happened again in the 2016 NBA offseason when Lebron used his leverage once again to give out a 4 year/57 million (!) dollar contract to J.R. Smith. Lebron James has a penchant for getting his teammates exorbitant sums of money with no regard for his team’s future salary cap situation.

Sure, these contracts worked in the short term as the Cavs won the 2016 NBA championship but these contracts are rearing their ugly heads now and have resulted in this “s*** team” around Lebron.

According to Brian Windhorst while appearing on the Lowe Post, Lebron was especially bothered by the Cavs not trading for either Paul George or Eric Bledsoe this past offseason (4). As tempting as it is taking on either Tristan Thompson making 16.4 million dollars this season or J.R. Smith making 13.8 million dollars, both the Suns and the Pacers made the right decision and passed. Lebron cannot be mad at the Cavs front office because he was the one that hampered them in the first place. There was no way the Cavs were going to put the best offer on the table for either player due to Lebron’s own front office decisions.

We can even go back to Lebron’s heat days where he urged the Heat to trade up to draft Shabazz Napier (5). Now, Napier has played well for the Trail Blazers in their 3 guard lineup but his Heat tenure was very disappointing. Shabazz averaged 19.8 minutes while playing for the Heat with 5.1 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per contest. He was traded to the Magic after one season for a 2016 second-round pick. I hate doing this but if you look back at the 2014 NBA draft, the very next person to go was Clint Capela with Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kyle Anderson following soon after. Lebron struck again by acting as the GM and ended up wasting a first round pick on a player the Heat had no use for. 

Lebron is no doubt going to go down as one of the greatest players to ever play the game but should go down as one of the worst GM’s as well. This “s*** team” is the result of Lebron’s own short sighted GM moves. 

TL;DR: Lebron should never again partake in front office decisions because nearly every front office decision he has impacted has turned out poorly. This is especially seen with this current inferior Cavs supporting cast since the front office was in a bind against the salary cap due to Lebron influenced decisions from years ago.

23,Analysis of LeBron’s five fouls in game 5,76,26rnkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/26rnkg/analysis_of_lebrons_five_fouls_in_game_5/,343,1401375293.0,"Analysis of LeBron’s five fouls in game 5

###The [first foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=41) was called by Ken Mauer at 6:12 first quarter (5:48 into the game).

Paul George tries to split Bosh and LeBron and is tripped. When I watch the video it looks like LeBron’s left knee catches George’s left leg as LeBron swivels. We would need an angle from the endline to say for sure.

###The [second foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=64) was called by Ken Mauer at 2:43 first quarter (3:29 later).

This is the type of foul that is hard to understand by fans. The key here is that LeBron never established Legal Guarding Position, or LGP. The rules define certain things that must take place in order to *establish* Legal Guarding Position (in the path of offensive player, getting to the spot first, getting to the spot without contact to an opponent), certain things that the defender *can* do once they have LGP (move laterally or obliquely, move the feet, have feet off ground, etc), and certain things that causes the defender to *lose* LGP (moving forward, leaving the path of the offensive player, etc).

In this case **LeBron never established initial Legal Guarding Position**. He  was never in Hill's path before Hill started upward motion to shoot or pass.

When a player does not have Legal Guarding Position, **the amount of contact does not matter**. All the referee needs to decide is 1) if the player had legal position, and 2) if not, did the contact disadvantage the offensive player. The referee decided this contact disadvantaged Hill, and thus cannot be incidental or marginal contact. *I think we need an endline angle on this play as well.

Check out my other posts on Legal Guarding Position where I go into much more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1wcbfw/durant_and1/cf0s6ym), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1yo65t/duke_defeats_syracuse_6660_in_cameron/cfmp3qw), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1yo65t/duke_defeats_syracuse_6660_in_cameron/cfmoqdw).

###The [third foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=152) was called by Ed Malloy at 6:03 second quarter (8:40 later).

This is also a Legal guarding Position play. If Paul George *has* established position (got to the spot) before LeBron contacts him, it is a charge. If PG *has not* established position before LeBron gets there, it is a blocking foul.

It is important to understand that the way LGP is applied changes depending on the type of play. On a shot or pass attempt, LGP needs to be established before the offensive player begins his upward motion to shoot or pass. **On a dribbling play like this, the upward motion clause is not in play**, which allows Paul George to quickly get to the spot and establish LGP before LeBron charges into him. Here is the case play:

NBA Case Play 29

*Player A1 is dribbling the ball and Player B1 jumps into his path. What is the deciding point between block or charge?*

A dribbler is expected to be in control at all times and if a defender can legally get to a ‘spot’ in the path of the dribbler, **it is the dribbler’s responsibility to stop and/or change direction** immediately. However, if a defender cannot completely get his torso in his path without making contact, a blocking foul should be called.

COMMENTS ON THE RULES - C

###The [fourth foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=220) was called by Tom Washington at 11:39 second quarter (6:24 later).

Foul. LeBron clearly hits Hibbert’s arm. No discussion necessary.

###The [fifth foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=248) was called by Ed Malloy at 8:34 third quarter (3:05 later).

I watched this play probably 30 times. Stephenson is fouled four times on this play, three times by LeBron. The first foul is an illegal screen by Rashard Lewis (moving forward into Lance at point of contact, also lowers shoulder *outside his frame*).

After Lance hits the ball out (clean), he tries to go around LeBron to the right, but LeBron puts out his right arm, which contacts Lance in the neck (foul). Lance responds by putting his arms around LeBron and tries to pull him out of the way (foul). LeBron then puts both arms behind him, still trying to prevent Lance from getting around him (foul). Then, when Lance dives for the ball, LeBron runs into Lance’s hip causing Lance to slip and hit the floor (foul).

This is a tough play. In this case the referee needs to be looking for either 1) the first foul, or 2) who disadvantages who more. Both players fouled each other, that is clear. But the NBA is a physical game, and when both players have an opportunity to get a loose ball *some* of this type of contact is allowed. In this case **LeBron fouls Stephenson just as Stephenson is about to get the ball**.

As you can see above, the rumor that Ed Malloy called all five fouls is bullshit.

But Devin Booker is historically bad at leading his team to victory. This is Booker's 5th year in the league and he's never led his team to 25 wins. He's led his team to the worst record in the west 3 years in a row though. And it's not like the Sun's are a shit organization. The last time the Sun lost as many games as Devin Booker has lost in his best season was 1969, the very first year of the Sun's organization. That means Devin Booker has played on 4 of the 5 worst teams in Suns history. He's having a good year statistically and the Suns are improved but what other Allstar averaged 60 losses for their first 4 seasons? Most Allstars have probably never even lost 60 games in a season before. And the Sun's improvement is even exaggerated a bit this year, because 19 of the last 34 games are against teams with winning records while only 18 of the first 48 games were against teams with winning records. Brandon Ingram who is also a young star and plays on a losing team has already played 28 games against teams with winning records this year. And only 11 games left this season are against winning teams. So I expect the Suns to drop in the standings and New Orleans to rise. The Suns would be lucky to get 35 wins this season.

32,[OC] Draft picks aren't worth nearly as much as you think they are : the expected return of a no1 overall pick is … Matt Barnes,74,bpbj9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bpbj9f/oc_draft_picks_arent_worth_nearly_as_much_as_you/,155,1558036029.0,"I think there's a massive gap between the perceived value of a draft pick, and it's actually value as far as contributing wins to the franchise that gets it.

This has a couple of results : 

1. Teams, media and fans all give picks far more value than they're actually worth in trades involving players

2. It puts an unreasonably high expectation on all top draft picks, who are all expected to be studs, when statistically, simply being a good starter means they're probably above average

3. It puts unreasonably high expectations on front offices, who are seen as failures if they didn’t get the best player available with their pick, when statistically, it’s almost impossible to get it right, outside of maybe no1 overall.

So I wanted to compile the average and median values of each 1st and 2nd round pick in the draft since 1985 (beginning of the lottery) to 2016 (2017 and 2018 draftees just haven't been in the league long enough), using the two most recognised publicly available cumulative advanced stats : Win Shares (WS) and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP). Neither of which are perfect, but they give a bit of an idea.

(Note : even stopping the range at the 2010 draft, the median results aren’t really changed in any significant manner).

I'm using both median and average, but the median is probably far more representative. Since these are cumulative stats, the worst outliers don't stay in the league long enough to accumulate massively negative totals, whereas the best outliers can rack up WS/VORP for 20 years. Median is far less susceptible to outliers, so **pay attention to the median column more than the average.**

And just for fun, the median outcome for the *best* 2nd round pick, 31st, is Joe Alexander. Who ? Exactly.

All this isn’t even mentioning that, in the current NBA, it’s increasingly difficult to hold onto whoever you draft with a high pick. So there are few good players that are statistically bolstering the median, and even moreso average value of the players drafted at a certain pick, but nowadays, odds are a large chunk of that value isn’t even going to be for the team that picked the guy. Further downgrading the value of a pick.

----------

Now, to be fair, those are the values of what each specific pick ends up being worth. But you could make the argument that the inherent value of a pick is the best player left available at that spot, not the player picked with it.

Personally, I don’t really agree with that, because, again, statistically, it’s almost impossible to actually get the “best player still available” with any pick that isn’t no1. 

For example, from 1984 to 2016, according the WS stat, the player picked 2nd ended up being the best player still available at second a total of … 4 times. Out of 33, AKA 12%. This isn’t because 88% of front offices are incompetent, it’s because the draft is a crapshoot. Even with all the scouting and player projection stats in the world, it’s almost impossible to know ahead of time who the best player left is. Front offices keep convincing themselves that, because they’re good, they’ll actually get value out of a 6th or 8th pick or whatever, but odds are, they won’t.

But here’s the catch, even if every single front office from 1984 to 2016 had a time machine, and could know in advance who the best player available at each pick was, picks *still* wouldn’t be as valuable as you think.

Here’s the value of the “best player left” at each pick :

More notes :

- Obviously, it’s a lot better. But there’s still a big gap between no1 and the rest.

- If you’re wondering why the list ends at 56, it’s because there’s never been any NBA draft from 1984 to 2016 in which 57 or more players actually played in the league.

Here's an example of a couple of retired players whose career VORP and WS are roughly equal to the median value of the best player left at each top-10 pick :

|Pick|Players approaching median value (VORP)|Players approaching median value (WS)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Chris Webber, Andre Iguodala, Manu Ginobili|Dominique Wilkins, Dikembe Mutombo, Bob Lanier|
|2|Ron Harper, Robert Horry, Bobby Jones|Rod Strickland, Michael Finley, David West|
|3|Chris Bosh, Shawn Kemp, Steve Francis|Mike Bibby, Ricky Pierce, Bill Cartwright|
|4|Luol Deng, Glen Rice, Antoine Walker|Richard Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, Elden Campbell|
|5|Bryon Russell, Mychal Thompson, Rick Fox|Gerald Wallace, toni Kukoc, Jason Richardson|
|6|Kenyon Martin, Rolando Blackman, Bruce Bowen|Kirk Hinrich, Jerry Stackhouse, Cuttino Mobley|
|7|Stephen Jackson, Tony Allen, Anderson Varejao|Kenny Smith, Steve Kerr, Jalen Rose|

|9|Josh Howard, Matt Bonner|Shawn Bradley, Vinny Del Negro|
|10|Roy Hibbert, Jim Paxson, Anthony Parker|Mo Williams, Glenn Robinson, Raef LaFrentz|

Sure, it’s better, but still. The best player you can expect to still be available with a 5th pick in the draft is a Rick Fox level player ? Is a 5th pick *that* valuable, considering Rick Fox is who you could reasonably expect to get, **assuming you get lucky and pick the best player available** ??

-----

#Conclusion

A set pick, after the lottery has taken place, is not that valuable. Teams fall in love with the possibility of getting something great, and grossly overvalue them. The Lakers’ 4th pick, for example. The best player that the Lakers (or whoever trades for that pick) can expect to be available at that slot is a Luol Deng, Antoine Walker level player. And statistically, no team with the 4th pick has ever actually correctly picked the 4th best player on that draft. So the best player that will be available, likely won’t be better than a 2 or 3 time All-Star, and it’s almost certain that you won’t even guess who it is.

But a future pick, that you have zero idea (especially with the flattened lottery odds) where it’s actually going to end up in the draft, in a draft class that you can’t possibly know the strength and depth of a year or two ahead of time ? That should have less value than any reasonably decent NBA player.

Say a team like Chicago was offering up its 2021 first round draft pick. GMs around the league would be salivating at that idea, and ready to pay through the nose for it. But the expected return for that pick is actually lower than a guy like Elfrid Payton or Terry Rozier. But if Chicago traded their 2021 1st for one of those guys, the entire NBA world would go crazy.

Oh, and I haven’t even mentioned that, since the one-and-done rule is one the way out, the draft is going to become *even more* of a crapshoot.

**TL;DR** Just as someone eventually figured out that 3 point shots, or versatile wing defenders, were undervalued, some GM will inevitably figure out that draft picks are overrated. Any team that isn’t a bottom feeder and owns a pick that’s perceived as having value (Celtics having the Grizzlies pick, Lakers’ 4th pick, etc) should look to sell high on that pick immediately. Any team that’s looking to rebuild should look to free agency as their way out, or smart trades for good young players, not tanking. Building a contender through the draft only works if you manage to hoard a shitton of high first rounders, and get very, *very* lucky.",0.55,controversial,2019-05-16 12:47:09

I think winning the championship with Toronto put a wrench in his plans for coming to LA because it would have looked a lot better if they had lost. This whole prolonged period of 'indecision' is just Kawhi looking like he's really considering all his options when really he's just gonna go to the Laker's. It's why he didn't announce it right after meeting with the Raptors and the buzz was at an all time high. He's gonna keep waiting til doubt creeps in for Toronto and then eventually he'll announce Lakers during the weekend.

Majority of their title legacy comes from the early days of the nba WHEN THERE WERE ONLY 8 TEAMS. Not only were their 8 teams but most of the HOF of the era were on the Celtics team. So to tout championships to fans and franchise of 30 modern day teams is irreverent it's basically an award for who was there first. Then we go in too the Larry Bird era which is no doubt impressive 3 titles and 5 appearances in the 80s.  That's great and at the point was establishing themselves as a franchise with a championship pedigree. Then they went on to win 1 title in the past 32 years. How is this impressive? How do they hold a reputation of ""if you want to win titles you should play for the Celtics"" when besides one era that hasn't been the case.

37,I rewatched the second quarter of last nights Celtics-Sixers game and took a look at every foul call against the Celtics,0,8hv9fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8hv9fe/i_rewatched_the_second_quarter_of_last_nights/,39,1525799124.0,"Since a lot of people were outraged about the fould discrepancy in that quarter and attributed it to the league wanting to extend the series, I looked at every foul call and tried to determine if it was the right call. I don't have a horse in the race since the Sixers beat our ass in the last round and fuck the Celtics anyway.   


1. 10:43 Marcus Morris: Right call. grabs Embiid in the paint to prevent a layup
2. 07:43 Marcus Smart: Right call. swipes Embiid across the face and doesn't complain for a second afterwards
3. 07:31 Jaylen Brown: Soft call. technically the right call because Jaylen is out of position when the contact with Saric occurs. The refs should not have called that on the first contact imo. 
4. 07:01 Jayson Tatum (offensive foul): Right call. Tatum grabs Redick's arm and pulls him to the ground when trying to establish position in the post. 
5. 05:56 Semi Ojeleye: Right call. even though Belinelli flops a bit. Ojeleye pushes Belinelli into Simmons after a screen. 
6. 05:15 Semi Ojeleye: Probably the right call but could have been a play on imo. There is no replay but it looks like Ojeleye is out of position when the contact with Ilyasova occurs and he doesn't complain much after the call which is usually a sign for a right call. 
7. 04:21 Marcus Morris: Right Call. He hits Saric on the arm.
8. 03:50 Marcus Morris: Really hard to tell. Redicks tries to go over an Embiid screen and it seems like Morris pushes him of his path. No replay so impossible to tell how much contact really occurred. 
9. 02:51 Aron Baynes: Right call. Baynes slowly reacts to Embiids movement and does not establish position before the contact.
10. 02:40 Marcus Smart: It's the loose ball foul that's also on the front page. Watching it live in real time it seemed like the right call. Simmons steals the ball, Smart dives to the floor and it looks he hit's Simmons legs causing him to fall. In the replay you can see that Simmons starts to fall before the contact occurs and it should have been a no call. Really difficult call to make imo because in that situation it's a foul on the defender almost every other time.
11. 02:31 Terry Rozier (offensive foul): Right call hits Redick in the face. Afterwards the scuffle with Embiid occurs where a double tech was warranted imo. 
12. 01:40 Jaylen Brown: Really hard to tell. There is some grabbing and pushing going on between Brown and Belinelli away from the ball. To me it looks like a bit of a flop by Belinelli, which you could also consider a veteran move by him. He sold the call and Brown should have not engaged in that contact with 2 Fouls already.   


In conclusion I would say that foul calls against the Celtics were mostly warranted with few questionables among them. What I didn't check for is non-calls that the Celtics should have gotten in their favor. But the 12 fouls that were called against them during that quarter are not evidence that the league tried to rigg the game.",0.49,controversial,2018-05-08 10:05:24

All last year, and during this offseason everyone has been shitting on him because he sucked so bad. Now we trade him, and everyone instantly gets on the ""LET'S SHIT ON THE KINGS RIGHT MEOW"" bandwagon.

Do you guys not understand?

We just dumped our two WORST contracts. Not just bad, but WORST. You think Philly would just take those on for free? Fuck no. We HAD to give up Stauskas just so they get SOMETHING out of this deal.

Yeah, it sucks we had to give him up after one year, and I have no doubt he will continue to improve and be a good player. BUT, now we are in a great position with arond $25million in cap space instead of $10million.

Everyone says"" Yeah, but clearing cap space doesn't mean shit if free agents dont sign there."" And yes, this is true, BUT we have already secured an appointment with Wes Matthews, and we can offer him more money than both Dallas and Toronto who are the other 2 teams interested in him at this point.

So, we are essentially trading Nik Stauskas for Wes Matthews, because odds are, if we offer him the most money, he will come to Sacramento. No matter how shitty a situation, MONEY TALKS. 

Wes is an immediate upgrade on BOTH ends of the floor, and along with Collison, Rudy Gay, Willie Cauley-Stein, and DeMarcus, that's a damn good starting lineup now. We also still have about $10 million left in cap space to sign other players who we need, whether it be Rondo(which i really hope we don't do), or just solid bench players.

So before everyone keeps running Sacramento into the ground, lets see what happens.

If Wes comes to Sacramento, are you REALLY going to talk shit about this deal? Yes, Nik could end up being better than Wes, but it's going to take at LEAST 3 years for that to happen, and Kings are trying to get a .500+ team before the new arena opens. 

WE DONT NEED TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. JUST WIN 42+ GAMES AND MAYBE SNIFF PLAYOFFS AND KINGS FANS ARE HAPPY.

So please, instead of shitting on the Kings in every possible way possible, wait and see what happens. If we end up getting no free agents to come this offseason after trading Nik, THEN talk shit about us. But not yet.",0.48,controversial,2015-07-02 05:45:24
39,[OC] Why Donovan Mitchell is making this ROTY race close and interesting,16,86xnos,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/86xnos/oc_why_donovan_mitchell_is_making_this_roty_race/,181,1521970262.0,"I know, I know. We're all sick of hearing about it and talking about it. And I'm mostly in agreement. I wouldn't be posting this had I not put admittedly too much time into it - and I genuinely think I found some  really interesting things that haven't been talked about yet. Obviously I'm a Jazz fan, but I tried to eliminate as much bias as I could in this deep dive. 



**Ben's a rookie. But...**


Let's take a look at some timeline stuff here.



9/30/2016 Ben broke his foot.


01/21/2017  [Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKRJmuPQidE) is seen warming up with his team on a road game. He doesn't look 100% but you can see he's made a lot of progress, and is practicing with the team.


07/10/2017 Philly.com writes an article about how much a year in the NBA benefitted [him.](http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/sixers/ben-simmons-sixers-process-year-off-injury-joel-embiid-20170710.html). This was about a month after the 2017 NBA draft. I think this is significant because I've heard a lot of fans say that Ben's first year didn't benefit him that much, but I think that there are a lot of holes in that argument. 


I think there are 3 reasons why a year in the NBA (even if some of that time is spent injured) is more beneficial than a year in the NBA:

* Basketball is now their life. They don't have to worry about school or any other non-basketball related things. 
* They now have access to the best coaches and trainers in the world. Coaches in the NCAA are good, but the NBA has an overall better player development facilitation.
* They get to develop chemistry with their teammates. Whether it's in practice, or socially, I believe that off court chemistry often translates to on court chemistry.


I understand that Ben is still a rookie, I'm not trying to argue against that. But what if to even the playing field, we counted stats for Donny from 11/20/2017? I'm aware that a lot of people won't agree with this. Donny is still having a great overall season. But from 11/20/2017, he's doing even better.  


**So, what if we didn't count Donovan's first month**


DM since 11/20/2017: 
* 22.0/3.9/3.8 with a TS% of 55.7%. 


Only 20 players in the league average at least 21/3/3 since 11/20/2107. DM is 11th on that list in FG%. 


Out of all the players that are under 6'4"", there are only 7 who have similar or better [stat](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=AGE&dir=-1&CF=PTS*G*21:AST*G*3:REB*G*3&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F23%2F2018&Height=LT%206-4) line. This obviously isn't a standalone argument, but I find it interesting. Some good company on that list. 


**Donovan's Rebounding**  


One of the main arguments against Donovan not getting ROY is that Ben averages double his rebounds. Which seems silly to me, since rebounding has in large part due to height, so it make sense that an agile 6'10"" guard would have more rebounds than Dono, at 6'3"". But I wanted to prove that Donny is a damn good rebounder for his height. So I found [this](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&dir=1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=GP*G*50:REB*G*3&Height=LT%206-4). He's 4th in the league in contested rebounds compared to players under 6'4"".


I also found it interesting that Ben is [second to last](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&dir=-1&CF=REB*GE*7&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&Height=GT%206-4) in contested rebounds amongst players who average 7 or more rebounds and are taller than 6'4"". Again, not a convincing standalone stat, and Ben is still a good rebounder, but maybe the gap between Dono and Ben isn't as wide as the season averages suggest.


**Donovan's Assists**


Again, a common argument against Dono is that he only averages half the amount of assists as Ben. Here's what I found on that:


* Ben averages 75.4 passes a game. That's 10 more than the next highest passer. 
* He assists 7.8 times a game so that means has just above 10% pass to assist ratio. Which doesn't sound bad and could in large part have to do with the 76ers offense, but when you compare him to the rest of the players in the NBA, he's 37th on the list of pass to assist ratio% for players that pass the ball more than 30 times a game. 
* However, only 15 players are averging more than 7 assists a game.
* Out of 75.4 passes made, 16.5 are potential assists. And out of those 16.5, 7.8 of those end up being assists. The Don's numbers: 38.5 passes made, 6.9 are potential assists, and 3.6 end up being assists. 


Not a huge argument against Ben, I don't think it matters that he passes the ball alot, and get's passed to a lot(80 times a game). But, the percentage of assists is what I was looking at. Donovan averages 9.8% assists a game, meaning that if he passed the ball as much as Ben, he'd average just as many assists. Interestingly enough, Dario Saric averages almost as many assists as Ben - and the Jazz don't have a single player that averages more than 5. Everyone averages from like 3-5.



**Donovan is the Jazz's #1 scoring option and go to in the clutch**


I think the game last night against the Spurs is the answer as to why he is. He's got a lot of room to improve still which is the crazy thing. This is one of the bigger reasons why I think this ROTY race is close, and Ben isn't as much of a shoe in as people may think. Donovan is leading the team in scoring, and is clearly the guy that the Jazz want to have the ball in his hands in close situations as a rookie. But let's look at some stats and see how he fares against the rest of the league and maybe you'll see why I put so much weight on it. It's not a comparison to Ben's TDs, it's a comparison to the rest of the league this year.

 

* Donny is 4th in the NBA in 4th Q USG% and 9th in 2nd half USG%. 
* He's 8th in scoring in the second half, only 1.4 points behind the MVP James Harden. 
* He averages 7.2 pts in the 4th Q (4th in the league). Not that it matters, but that's almost double what Ben averages(3.7)
* [Context is everything](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&dir=-1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F24%2F2018&Period=4&CF=GP*G*35) I think it's significant to point out that he's ahead of James Harden, Lebron, Giannis, Lillard, Irving and on and on. His rebound and assists go up in the 4th - in fact just about everything improves in the 4th for Donny.  


**How do the Jazz do when Donovan excells?**


* When Spida scores more than 1/4 of his season average for scoring in the 4Q (so more than 5PTS), the Jazz are 25-15 (which includes a tough as shit december where we were without our star center). 
* The Jazz are 28-15 when he averages more than half his season average in the 2nd half (again includes a hard december). 
* Since December 30th, they're 22-4 when he averages more than half his season average in the 2nd half. 


One thing I found interesting is when Don overperforms with his rebounds and assists.

* When DMitch has 2 or more assists in the 2nd half, the jazz are 26-13.
* When he has 2 or more rebounds in the 2nd half, they're 29-14.

Again, not a standalone argument. But still something of note. It's also interesting at doing the same thing with Ben's rebounds and assists.


* When Ben has 4 or more assists in the 2nd half, the 76ers are 16-14. 
* When he has 2 or more assists in the 4th Q, they're 14-17. 
* When he has 2 or more rebounds in the 4th Q, they're 21-16. 
* They're 22-14 when he has more than 4 rebounds in the 2nd half. 

It's really interesting to see how they don't do as well when Ben assists a lot in the 4th Q. Not really sure why, or if it's even significant. 


**Other Stats about the Don's scoring**

* Donovan is [12th](https://stats.nba.com/players/scoring/?sort=PCT_UAST_2PM&dir=-1&CF=MIN*G*30:GP*G*30&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) in the league in unassisted 2 point FG% at 76.7 - meaning he creates shots for himself. 
* He's [9th](https://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVE_PTS&dir=1&CF=DRIVES*G*8&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F24%2F2018) in the league in points off of drives at 7.9 at 47.8%. James Harden is at 53%  It's actually where DM gets a third of his assists too; off of the drive. 


**Making history**


Let me first point out that Ben's TD record is really impressive. Definitely one of the main arguments for him getting ROY. But since when have triple doubles been the pinnacle of succes where all other stats pale in comparison to the almighty triple double? I think it definitely holds a lot of significance, but I don't know if it's as much of a trump card as people say it is. If it matters, the 6ers are 6-4 when Ben get's a TD.


So where does Donovan stand?

* 2 40+ point games. Most since Blake Griffin and if I knew how to compare that to rookies over the past 20+ years I would - but I'm guessing it's pretty impressive. One of those games includes the 6th most effecient 40 point game (based on fg%) this season if you filter out games where people took less than 6 3PA and is 9th if you include those. He had 5 rebounds and 6 assists in that game too might I add, and had a TS% of 95.5%, and offensive rating of 141.1, a defensive rating of 82.2, and a net rating of 58.8 in 33 minutes. The Jazz are 2-0 when Dono scores more than 40. 
* 25 25+ point games. I don't know how that compares to other other rookies in like the past 20-30 years but I would assume it's significant. That Jazz's record during those games? 16-9; 13-3 since december 30th (Ugh, that december...). Donny averages 51.46/36/85.3, and an EFG% of 58.1 in these games.
* 39 20+ point games. I really wish I could find the stats on how that compares to rookies over the past 20-30 years. The Jazz are 25-14 when he scores 20 or more points. 
* He's currrently on pace to averge more than 20 pts a game. Only 44 rookies have ever done that all time, and 21 since 1980. 
* He's also on pace to tie Damien Lillards record of most 3 pointers made by a rookie, and be 2nd (behind Joe Ingles) in most 3 pointers made in a season in franchise history.



**What a time to be a basketball fan**


Alright, I think that's all I got. My ultimate goal of this whole thing is to convince people that the race for ROY is and should be close. I'll also point out how awesome that is. How lucky are the Jazz and the 76ers. 


One last thought. Ben is incredible and will be well deserving of the award if he wins (and the future MVPs he'll win). Despite what a lot of people say I don't think that the fact that Ben doesn't shoot threes(yet) or has a below average FT% should count against him. Just like because of some of the stats I've listed above I don't think that the fact that Donovan doesn't have as many assists or rebounds as Ben does has as much weight as people say it does. 


A lot of these stats are pulled from 11/20/17, but most of them are pretty similar to if you changed it to the entire year. The biggest difference is that Donovan averages(currently) 20 points on the year, and 22 from 11/20/2017.


p.s. I welcome all criticism if you think some of my stats are off/ don't mean anything and would love to hear your opinion about any of them.

44,[OC] Why the Celtics' 21-4 start won't be sustainable.,0,7ht9d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7ht9d0/oc_why_the_celtics_214_start_wont_be_sustainable/,64,1512540651.0,"Before I start, I want to say that this post isn't calling the Celtics a bad team or disparaging their red-hot start to the season. It's just saying that their crazy success so far may be unsustainable.

When the Celtics' season started off with Gordon Hayward's gruesome leg injury and an 0-2 start, no one on r/nba or in the real world expected the Celtics would perform nearly as well as they have so far. However, the young, woke Celtics have been 21-2 since then including victories over the Raptors, Thunder, Spurs and Warriors. Their hot start has been fueled by great 3-point shooting (8th 3P% in the NBA), excellent team defense (1st in DefRtg). However, these stats- and this hot streak- are very unsustainable.

**Three-Point Shooting**

The Celtics are 8th in the NBA in three-point percentage, and if you factor out Marcus Smart's abysmal 29.6% on 4.3 attempts per game, they jump all the way up to 2nd. This three-point shooting boost has been heavily influenced by the improvement of Al Horford and Jaylen Brown from beyond the arc, and the surprising shooting ability of Jayson Tatum. 

Al Horford finished last year shooting 35.5% from beyond the arc, which is about his career average. However, this year he's started out at a scorching 44.6%-a 9.1% jump. 9.1% is the difference between Lonzo Ball's three-point percentage and Khris Middleton's. It doesn't take a genius or a Bayesian statistician to predict that the odds of that lasting are low. However, even if he sustains his percentages miraculously, odds are that Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum won't.

Jaylen Brown has nearly tripled his three-point attempts this season, which usually correlates with a decrease in percentage. Instead, his percentage has actually increased from 34.1% to 40.2%. This 6% increase is the difference between LeBron's three-point percentage in 2004 and his three-point percentage this year. Both Brown and Horford will likely come back to earth, and that's without mentioning Jayson Tatum.

Jayson Tatum is shooting 51.3% from 3 this season, a ridiculously high percentage considering he was a 34.2% shooter in college. If Lonzo Ball makes his next 90 three-point attempts, his three-point percentage still won't have made the same jump Tatum's has. Tatum has been putting up excellent shooting numbers this season, as have Horford and Brown, but the truth is that all these percentages are unsustainable.

**Defense and ""Intangibles""**

The Celtics have also been the number one defensive team in the NBA during their hot start, arguably even more important to their success than their three-point shooting. However, teams have been shooting pretty poorly against them. Teams shoot a paltry 34 percent from three against the Celtics, the 26th-highest percentage against any team in the NBA, and only 48.4 percent from inside the arc, also good for 26th. However, it's been shown many times that opponent field goal percentage isn't really affected by defense, so these numbers may also be fluky. The Celtics are certainly a very good defensive team, due in no small part to coach Brad Stevens, but they probably aren't the best team in the league by a good margin like their DefRtg would show.

The Celtics have demonstrated the ability to win close games this season and close out in the last few minutes. This trait, while certainly a sign of a good team, is also very luck-based and will revert closer to the mean over the course of the season. The only way their close game win percentage can be sustainable is if Kyrie Irving does what Isaiah ""Mr. 4th Quarter"" Thomas did last year and continues to put up insane fourth quarter numbers. However, if that doesn't happen, the Celtics will probably revert closer to their Pythagorean win total, which would put them currently at 18-7.

Even more factors, like the Celtics' bottom-five strength of schedule, have helped them during their miraculous winning streak. And looking at the statistics, it's just not going to be possible for the Celtics to maintain their 65-win pace. Sooner or later they will revert back to the mean.

**Conclusion: The Celtics are still good**

However, the mean for the Celtics is still very good. Brad Stevens, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, and a plethora of talented role players won the 1-seed last year with an arguably worse roster. Sure, they probably aren't in the Cavs/Warriors/Rockets tier yet, but if their young stars develop they can get there soon especially with their top-tier coaching. The Boston Celtics are a problem for the rest of the NBA and, with their young stars, future assets, and GM-wizard Danny Ainge, will be for a long time.",0.5,controversial,2017-12-05 22:10:51

49,Brandon Ingram is One of The Most Overrated Players in The League,534,a8xjgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a8xjgt/brandon_ingram_is_one_of_the_most_overrated/,466,1545622292.0,"When Brandon was drafted, a lot of people, myself included, thought he’d be a walking bucket. As a Duke fan, I loved to cheer for him in college and I thought he’d be great in the league.
  
  
Obviously, he dissapointed massively in his rookie season. That might have been the worst season i’ve ever seen a player play. He struggled to score in any fashion whatsoever. I’ll admit Ingram’s come far from his rookie season as one of the worst players in the league to become a good player. But now I think he’s becoming massively overrated. 
  
  
The stigma around Ingram I’ve seen in past and current trade talks label him a marquee talent I personally think he’s undeserving of, and I find that casual fans or fans from other teams are very unaware about the type of player he is. They might tout his 39% 3PP from last year to describe him as a great shooter, but anybody who watches him here obviously know that that percentage came as a result of a very selective shot selection. He doesn’t like to shoot any off the dribble 3s or rhythm threes. He only considers taking them when he’s at least two feet wide open. They commonly for some reason I don’t know think of him as some low post or mid range savant, but he’s far from that. I mean sure he **takes** a lot of pull ups and post up shots, but he makes about barely enough of them to warrant him a pass to keep attempting them. For his pull ups, i’ve compared him to somebody who takes around as many pull up shots as him: Jamal Murray. Last season from 10-16 ft, Ingram shoots 35% compared to Murray’s 48%. For post ups, I compared his second season to Kobe in his rookie season since they were in somewhat similar positions and took the same frequency of shots from 3-10 ft. Ingram shot 20.7% compared to Kobe’s 40.9%. That’s half of Kobe’s percentage. He is by every means a below average shooter from these areas. Every label he’s given as a shooter is wildly innacurate, and frankly I don’t think his 3 point shot will ever be his bread and butter as a result of his hesitancy like it sort of was at Duke. The dude also is given credit as a great playmaker, but I’d say he’s just average. He misses one or two too many reads a game.
  
  
So, what are his strengths? Does he have any? I’ll give him props on D. He can be a pest on the perimeter with his length. Maybe driving? He converted on 65.7% of his shots from close range last season. He is also consistent i’d say. You can always expect around 15 points, 3 assists and 3 rebounds from him. 
  
  
As you can see, Ingram’s not amazing at anything. In fact, I’d say even his consistency could be spun against his case as a future all star because he is consistently average. He doesnt like to go all out for one game and excluding his career high against the Warriors, in his 2 and a half years in the league so far, as far as I am concerned he has had no breakout game. So what’s my problem with Ingram, he’s not amazing at any particular thing. Like for Lonzo, I can say he’s a great passer and defender. I can say Kuzma’s a great shooter, because he’s shown multiple glimpses of his potential. He’s made 6 threes in a half before and scored over 30 a couple times, but I can’t say anything similar about Ingram.

Conclusively, Ingram is average at almost everything. He is, however, very well rounded. And for that reason i’d say he his ceiling is a fringe all star. Maybe a top 40-50 player. Very good, but not the best. I’d love to say otherwise, but he hasn’t shown me much yet.

It's insane to me how Kawhi was the darling of this sub a month ago and suddenly all his goodwill is gone because he dared to sign with the Clippers and build his own legacy instead of taking a backseat to LeBron. The 'snake' and '#2' slander is out of control for a guy who just delivered the first title in franchise history to Toronto without ever complaining or giving less than 100% despite the prospect of leaving after the season. I wish Lakers/Bron fans would just admit they're bitter he didn't sign with them instead of cooking up all these lame spinzones and force feeding it down our throats until it becomes a legitimate narrative on r/nba.

53,Dwight Howard is NOT the best Center in the NBA,6,1jpuoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jpuoc/dwight_howard_is_not_the_best_center_in_the_nba/,140,1375700954.0,"Dwight is going to be the defensive anchor the Houston Rockets next year. He rebounds, blocks, alters shots, and gets points on the board – so why am I writing this? Because there is one other center in the league that does all this and more. Marc Gasol is that player. He recently won the Defensive Player of the Year award, something Dwight has already achieved three consecutive times in his career. But that was then, and this is now.

Offense

Firstly, let’s look at offense. Dwight Howard averaged a very respectable 17.1ppg for the Lakers last season. He was recovering from back surgery at the time, so I will give him the benefit of the doubt he will get recover 100%, and am going to use the season prior to last year as a bench mark to make the comparison fairer. In that case, he averaged 20.6 and 1.9 assists in 38.3 minutes of play. Comparatively, Gasol averaged 14.1ppg and a ridiculous 4 assists a game in 35.0 minutes of play. 20.6 is a larger number than 14.1, but let’s look at the details shall we?

Dwight Howard game consists almost totally on shots at the basket – 95.45% of his shots came in the paint.

graphic

He did an amazing job shooting 66.22% under the basket and 44.31% in the paint, but his efficiently drops elsewhere. The 42.31%, although somewhat good, does not tell the whole story because he only attempted 26 shots in 54 games from there. That’s not a shot the coaching staff of the Magic, Lakers, or Rockets want him taking.

Marc Gasol’s versatility is inconceivably better than Dwight’s. He not only shoots nearly as well as Howard from inside (66.22% vs 63.85%), but his midrange game is at an extraordinary 47.69%. The 50% mark is the standard for an efficient scorer; he’s doing this at 7’1 from 15-18 feet out. Not many centers, if any at all, can achieve this result.

graphic

In this day and age, floor spacing is everything. The Heat and Spurs, the two teams in the Finals last year, bombarded their opponents with 3’s while having one big man to anchor the middle. Gasol spreads the floor so well, the Grizzles have the luxury of playing two big men at once. Dwight on the other hand is confined to just the paint.

Passing also plays a key part in floor spacing. It is the fastest way to move the ball and thus forces the defense to scramble to move with it. That is why Gasol’s 4.0 assists a game are so important. His 4.0 assists a game are better than some starting point guard’s, which is a testament to his passing ability from both the low post and high post. Dwight averaged just 1.9 assists in his last season in for the Magic, which is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing too spectacular either.

Offensive rebounding is clearly Howard’s forte. Although he didn’t qualify to be ranked because he did not manage to play 56 games, he would’ve made 5th on the list. The year before that, he came in 3rd. Marc Gasol comes in 30th, right next to Blake Griffin. However, don’t doubt Marc’s ability to grab offensive boards. Zach Randolph, his frontcourt mate, took 1st on the list and if anybody watches the Grizzles, they’ll notice the Grizzles play a high-low offense. This means Randolph is placed under the basket, while Gasol is at the foul-line extended.

The video below, at 0:16 and 0:30 and so on, shows multiple variations of plays the Grizzles use when using Randolph and Gasol. As you can see, Gasol usually plays higher up, thus preventing him any chances to grab offensive boards unless they pop out far enough. This is the play style of the Grizzles. It’s not as if Gasol cannot grab rebounds, it’s the offensive sets designed for the team which places him in inopportune places to grab them.

As time winds down on the clock, teams tend to engage the Hack-a-Howard defense. Howard shot a horrid 49.1% from the charity strip while Gasol shot 84.8%. Howard cannot be trusted going to the line but the coach cannot take him out of the game. It would be “disrespectful” toward a superstar, and the media would build a ridiculous amount of drama around it. In other words, the coach would be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Gasol on the other hand, wouldn’t need to be taken off the court when these situations come into play. His was actually best free throw shooter of all forwards and centers in the league, exluding Kevin Durant. Although free throws are generally placed at a lower level of importance, we’ve all seen how important when teams are so good, the only thing separating them is a few easy buckets.

The last few things I want to go over is minutes, usage, and TO’s. Howard clearly gets more minutes than Gasol does. More minutes means more opportunities. The same goes for usage and TO’s. It’s understandable that Howard has more turnovers (3.2) compared to Gasol’s (2.0), but clearly, Gasol’s role has him passing more. Furthermore, Howard’s extra minutes, usage, and thus more points, help soften the disparity Howard’s and Gasol’s points per game.

Defense

Many people look at blocks and steals as the only measurement of defense. Even Dwight Howard said Serge Ibaka should’ve won the last two DPoY awards because “he led the league in blocks. That’s what defense is all about.” I highly doubt defense is hinged solely on blocks from bigs. If that were true, Sanders is the second best defensive big man this season, JaVale the season before, and Bogut should’ve won the DPoY 3 years ago instead of Howard. Clearly it’s very difficult to judge defense because all five players need to communicate and work as one unit – a different beast when compared to offense.

The pick-and-roll is used so often nowadays with the influx of amazing guards, big men need to learn to “hedge.” Howard is very quick on his feet and hedges so well that his guard can recover without letting the opposing guard drive right by, or let the big dive into the middle. Gasol does this as well, although his foot speed isn’t as quick as Howard’s.

Help defense is a key role in determining a good defensive player. Howard arguably does this better than any other big man. On the Lakers, Pau Gasol didn’t have the foot speed to keep up with the “stretch 4’s.” Howard was usually quick to rotate and help block/alter shots. Likewise, Marc Gasol does this too, but he isn’t nearly as athletic or quick as Howard. His blocks are slightly lower, 1.7 to Dwight’s 2.1, but that doesn’t mean Gasol didn’t help his team. The Grizzles had a 95.4 defensive rating with him on the court, good for second in the league, but a mediocre 102.2 with him off the court. Howard too helped the Lakers tremendously when he was on the court earning a 101.7 DR and 107.8 (near the bottom of the league) off the court. It’s hard to justify one better than the other because, although the Grizzles had a much better defensive rating with Gasol on the court compared to the Lakers and Howard, the Grizzles are just a better team defensively overall. A part of help defense is closing out on three point shooters. Howard takes this because of pure quickness and athleticism.

Defensive rebounding is the final key ingredient to a good defense, at least, when you don’t have a player like LeBron James. Howard wins this category because of his ridiculous 10.8 defensive boards compared to Gasol’s measly 5.8. I do believe Howard is a better rebounder, but I would like to point out Howard was running with 4 shooters while the Grizzle had two big men in the paint splitting rebounds. Nevertheless, I cannot discount Howard’s league-leading monster rebounding prowess.

Edit: Added an extra parapgraph concerning free throws.


tl;dr Just because Dwight's ppg and boards are higher than Gasol's doesn't automatically make him a better center. Offensively, Gasol shoots just as well inside as Dwight, and CONSIDERABLY better than the league in the midrange. He's also a damn good passer - just like his brother Pau. Defensively, I gotta say Dwight wins because of sheer athleticism and quickness. Both are great centers, I just think Gasol's better.",0.52,controversial,2013-08-05 04:09:14
54,[Serious] Team USA catering to superstars such as Lebron James and allowing them to skip events has led to our roster being depleted,5,d37p0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/d37p0y/serious_team_usa_catering_to_superstars_such_as/,104,1568322681.0,"After hearing CJ Mccolluns interview on the Woj podcast, I believe this all begins with Lebron 

You've probably noticed a trend by now... since 2012, Lebron and multiple stars skip the Team USA camp every year. They started skipping the Olympics as well. 

After completely embarassing losses in 2004 and 2006 where Lebron had reported attitude problems with coaches and staff 

Team USA begged Kobe and Jason Kidd to come in to show young Bron, Melo, etc how to truly work hard and lead. They also demanded 3 year commitments from anyone 

However, they now dont ask for commitments anymore since Kobe and J Kidd retired. It's all year to year and it has ruined Team USA.


Superstars drop out weeks before training camp because they know management has no backbone and will let them on the Olympics squad next year 

This leads to a trickling down effect to even the B tier stars, since they're saying ""they're only calling me because they need warm bodies. Stars Bron, Kawhi can skip this year and still be on the Olympics squad next year. All I'm doing is risking injury for no gain"". And that's kinda what CJ said",0.51,controversial,2019-09-12 14:11:21

**Clippers** are an org that try to do everything right (good system, solid role players all around & a team spirit) but lack that ace up their sleeve to do anything meaningful. Headed by the NBA logo himself, they never won a chip but they're looking to change that now.

**Raptors** are outsiders who fight for their own cause, their exuded fighting spirit attracts warriors who are (mostly) not from their own lands. They also don't live near the beach.

And finally the **Lakers** are one of the most celebrated franchises in NBA history. Their method of operation is waving fat stacks of cash alongside the Laker logo until they brainwash the most powerful players into joining them.

58,The sentiment that Westbrook is a good defender (or even competent) is the biggest misconception in the NBA,1,44k0rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/44k0rz/the_sentiment_that_westbrook_is_a_good_defender/,64,1454848472.0,"I'm a huge Westbrook fan, I respect his game, attitude, energy more than anyone, but I lose it when I hear people talk about how great of a defender he is. Sure, he's a capable defender, and can play some great lockdown on-the-ball defense. When he's on an island with a guy 1-on-1 he's as good as anybody - and I think these instances are what people think of when they think about his defense - but those situations only come up a couple times a game, and the reality is that he takes 99% of possessions off. 

When it comes to ball-watching, team defense, missing assignments, gambling incessantly etc... I really can't think of anyone worse. I mean the guy is completely clueless on team defense it's pretty incredible that people think he's a positive on defense, Hell, some people think that he's elite.

My notion that Westbrook is a negative on defense is not just supported by the eye test, it's backed by data as well. This season, players being guarded by Russell Westbrook have shot a better % than their yearly averages from every shot distance - 3P, 2P, <6 ft, <10 ft, >15 ft - by an average of 3.6%. Players shoot a whopping 48% when guarded by Russ. And of course this doesn't quantify the impact of Russell's team defense which, in my opinion, is the worst part of his game.

64,"[Opinion] Dellavedova tends to show reckless behavior in regards to other players' lower bodies, and that's a problem. Examples inside.",0,39zyiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/39zyiv/opinion_dellavedova_tends_to_show_reckless/,125,1434454987.0,"You may have your opinions on whether or not Dellavedova is an intentionally reckless or malicious player, but I've put together five plays that I thought exhibited a pattern of behavior: Delly is involved in several tripping incidents or attempts to trip players.

Not all of these are initially Delly's fault- but it does seem like he likes to fall near opponent's legs, throw his own legs in the way of their legs, or in some cases... deliberately knock a player down in retaliation.

Full disclosure, I am a homer and I hate watching this guy play. But I'm here to show why this opinion may be justified, and to shed light on a few incidents that were glossed over during the infamous exodus of Warriors fans between Games 1-4.
_________________________

In reverse chronological-ish order:

^((Shoutout to /u/abrightersummerday and /u/kdub2000 for providing the material and timestamps for the examples)^)

**1. Curry [""falls"" mysteriously.](https://vine.co/v/eOxLbq3OtY3)**  
Even in full speed, I find it odd that Dellavedova is fully prepared for his trailing leg to tangle with Steph's. Anyone who has tangled legs while running before knows that you usually fall out of surprise and a loss of balance. A counterpoint is that Dellavedova just shows supernatural balance and is one of the truly gifted athletes of this generation.

**2. Mo Speights get the steal, [Dellavedova increases his surface area to slow his fall, like a sky diver.](https://twitter.com/BuddyGrizzard/status/607734055229136896)**  
~~I'm half inclined to think that Dellavedova is so confident in his soccer technique and the ineptitude of the referees, that he believes he can save the ball from going out of bounds with his foot. But in reality, Delly was trying to box Mo out from getting the ball, and failed. I think this type of play is reckless- if you can't box out with your body, don't try to throw your leg out there for shits and giggles.~~  
~~Of course, it's possible that Delly is actually just a sub-par athlete, but that conflicts with our previous conclusion that he's an amazing athlete with supernatural balance.~~

/u/BillionaireBob pointed out that Mo actually kicks Delly's leg out here. I was wrong about this one, this is incidental.

**3. Draymond Green sets a hard screen, [Dellavedova retaliates](http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/9/8755229/watch-matthew-dellavedova-dive-into-draymond-greens-knees)**  
As a homer, all I see is Dellavedova scheming to end Draymond's career by popping his kneecap open using the hidden mallet he put in his Australian-brand socks. But in reality, Draymond started it. My issue is that most men with testicles and pride would stand up and start shit, but Dellavedova is fine taking shots at Draymond's hips/knees (depending on who you're rooting for in the finals). Regardless, this incident was mere inches away from Draymond being carted home in a stretcher. I don't like players who let it get below the belt. I'm looking at you, Chris Paul.
___________________________________
**Now, the retrospective section:**

*I didn't believe these plays were dirty at all at first, in fact I defended Delly to the Warriors fans who worried for Curry's health in this matchup.*

*In retrospect, I feel differently. Is it okay to look back and re-evaluate an issue? I believe so. Context matters, and when a player has been in multiple incidents where he's not afraid to tangle up below the belt, it calls into question all of his past actions.*
___________________________________
**4. Al Horford gives Delly the People's Elbow- [but look closely-er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmznHPMBwss&feature=youtu.be&t=35)**  
Did Horford start and end this sequence? Yes. Is he to blame? Yes. But, in my opinion, at the timestamp marked, Delly was kicking his way towards Horford in an attempt to land on his legs. I may or may not have felt this way before I saw the three examples preceding this, but it wouldn't be the first time. And that of course, leads me to the final example...

**5. The Kyle Korver [Incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyXod83nR1Y#&t=27sec)**  
I know we've been over this one before, and it doesn't warrant any further discussion. *There is NOTHING about this play that would make me think it's intentional*. But I've seen the other footage, and my conclusion after these five separate events is that Dellavedova just doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't care if he breaks your legs. He doesn't care if you trip or fall. *He doesn't care about sacrificing his own body, or yours, to make a play.*

_________________________________

That last statement to me, is the real problem. When a player doesn't respect their own well-being more than they respect winning a game, it's normally a good thing. But what about when that player is small, a poor athlete, and grew up playing some sort of Australian bloodsport?

To me, Dellavedova crosses lines. He may not intend to injure players, but he doesn't seem to be particularly risk-averse. He will fall on the ground and break his knee to save a lose ball, but he'll just as quickly break your knee to do the same.

My point is that Delly's dirty play is a different breed than what we call other dirty players. Patrick Beverly may grab and hold and irritate, Draymond Green and Zbo may throw an elbow, Serge Ibaka may punch you in the nuts, the list goes on. But an elbow probably isn't going to put you in a stretcher. A punch in the balls is temporary. And besides, **how many of those players have 5 GIF-worthy incidents in a span of 10 games?** What happens when a player's entire game is predicated on crossing a line below the belt?

I obviously have vested interests here. But to me, Delly isn't playing basketball out there. And the league should do something about it- in the form of a memo, or a phone call to this kid who's overcompensating for a lack of talent in a way that puts players in danger.

Klay Thompson has revolutionized the shooting guard position by transforming it from a ball dominant offensive force into the perfect off-ball threat.

Klay Thompson exists in a strange place in the NBA. Though he’s an All-Star and All NBA talent on the best team in the league, he is commonly regarded as the least essential part of the Golden State Warriors core lineup. His supporting role in the offense has led to him being involved in many trade rumors.  He’s been in talks for Kevin, Paul George and most recently, kyrie Irving
Those trades have all been rejected by Bob Myers and the Warriors because they know how valuable Thompson is to their team’s chemistry and makeup. Klay Thompson has been molded into the perfect complement for Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.

He’s a constantly moving shooting threat that keeps the defense on their toes and stretches the floor. While Thompson may be the most expendable member of the Warriors all star quartet, he has transformed into the archetypal shooting guard for the modern NBA and revolutionized the way the position is played.",0.5,controversial,2018-01-07 06:09:05

> Comparisons: Best Case: I've seen a lot of people saying Mike Bibby, so I'll go with that; Worst Case: Jannero Pargo, Steve Kerr, and JJ Redick. Bottom Line: Curry is an incredibly smart player. Not only does he understand the game, he understands his limitations. He probably is never going to end up being a star in the league because of a lack of explosiveness (meaning he will be a huge defensive liability). He should be able to hang around the league because of the all-around offensive package he brings to the table. - Bleacher Report, May, 2009 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/183841-nba-draft-prospects-stephen-curry-davidson


 **Klay Thompson** 

> But, at a career 42.3 % NCAA field goal percentage, this is precisely what worries me about Thompson: He perhaps overachieves on guile and his statistical production could reflect guile’s limitations. The concern is that the Warriors drafted already-realized potential, as opposed to tapping a grower like Kawhi Leonard........It’s this kind of action that draws praise from film-gurus like Sebastian Pruiti. I’m equally impressed by his screen-usage, but more than happy to go negative with a positive: If Thompson is this smart, then why aren’t his numbers smarter? This kid certainly knows how to expertly use picks. I’m just not sure that means Golden State is equally good at it.
What does this mean for Monta? It could mean nothing. Number 11 picks don’t usually become starters (Acie Law was picked at 11, for example).
I’m less inclined to be reverent towards Jerry West than many out there. He’s had a great career, but the septuagenarian executive left Memphis in shambles. Sorry to be age-ist, but I like West better as a consultant than an ultimate decision-maker. - Warriors World, June, 2011 http://www.warriorsworld.net/2011/06/24/klay-smart-gsws-good/

**More...**


> In the bigger picture, I have no idea how this arrest will affect Thompson's future. Have we seen him play his last game as a Coug? Even before his arrest, I figured that was the case. Thompson's a junior who was expected to leave early for the NBA, but there's some doubt about that because he's projected as a late-first round or second-round draft pick. Thompson has said if he were projected to go in the second round, he would stay for his senior season.
If I were an NBA GM, it wouldn't bother me, but maybe the marijuana charge will hurt his draft status. What would bother me more is the fact that Thompson isn't quite ready for the NBA, physically and I would argue emotionally as well. For as good as he is, Thompson can be surprisingly erratic, both with his shot and the ball. Remember, too, that this is also a kid who was late for the team bus in Tempe two weeks ago because he couldn't find his iPod.
But maybe I'm viewing this subjectively as the WSU alum who hopes that Thompson returns. With Thompson, Moore and DeAngelo Casto playing a third year together, the Cougs would be a top-25 team, one with the potential to crack the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.
Whatever happens, Thompson has been consistent in one respect -- good and bad, he never ceases to make you shake your head in disbelief. - SeattlePI, March, 2011 -  http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/moore/article/Thompson-s-erratic-ways-continue-this-time-with-1042357.php 


**Last for Klay**

> He reminds me of a less-quick version of Kevin Martin. Thompson is the son of former L.A. Lakers big man Mychal Thompson. ...Can Klay Thompson play in the NBA? Absolutely. But I've read where he is being compared to Reggie Miller and that is just silly. There is a difference between good, very good, and great. Klay Thompson's 3-pt percentage, this season was 39% (good) but not the 44% (great) that Miller's was at UCLA. Miller shot 54% FG (GREAT!) as a Bruin. Thompson's, as we mentioned, is 42% (not very good). Miller, as a junior, averaged 25.9 ppg. (very good). Thompson was 21.6 as a junior (good). ...I think Klay Thompson can be a good starter in the NBA sometime - but I don't foresee stardom. - Hoops Obsession, June , 2011 http://basslinespin.blogspot.com/2011/06/i-dont-hate-klay-thompson-plus-tyler.html

**Around this time we also had the Monta Ellis trade**

> Both acquisitions are good fits with the Warriors' roster, but neither was able to help Tuesday. The team was in shock before Ellis addressed them in a closed-door meeting and said his goodbyes before the game.
Ellis has been the face of the Warriors' franchise for much of his seven seasons. He was named the league's Most Improved Player in 2007 and has been among the NBA's top scorers the past three seasons.
But he was never a good fit alongside similar-sized Curry, and he started to show his frustration with the organization in the past week. His teammates immediately shared that frustration Tuesday, when Ellis and Udoh were informed of the trade via a scroll at the bottom of the TV.
As many players shook their heads in disbelief, Curry walked over and hugged a solo Udoh. Wright said, ""I'll talk about the game, but I'm not talking about the trade crap."" One Warriors player said, ""If we're giving up, I can feel my hip hurting already.""
""It's time,"" said a smiling Ellis. ""They're moving in a new direction. I can't be mad about that. I was in those shoes at one time, when a veteran guy was playing in front of me. It becomes time for that player to go. It's my time to go.""
The move opens immediate playing time for rookie Klay Thompson, a shooting guard who is getting rave reviews around the league and is considered nearly untouchable by the Warriors.
**With a potential playoff run all but lost, the move also opens the door for the Warriors to be more cautious with Curry's recurring ankle/foot injuries.** They maintain that they're going to try to win as many games as possible, but they'll be shorthanded and could see a precipitous drop in the standings. - SFGATE - March, 2012 http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Warriors-send-Monta-Ellis-to-Milwaukee-Bucks-3406832.php


**more...**


> The Milwaukee Bucks need to head on over to their local casino and put some serious bets down on the roulette table, because they are the luckiest bunch of guys in the country right now.
With the first big trade of the 2011-12 NBA season, the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed to send Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson to the Golden Warriors for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh and Kwame Brown.
After reading that, if you're left thinking ""why in the world would the Warriors make a trade like that?"", you're not alone.
There's no doubt that Andrew Bogut is a solid big man when he's healthy, but Golden State didn't necessarily make an upgrade at any position with this trade. Instead of becoming a better team, they sent away solid and consistent production for an injury-prone player, and a player that's well past his prime in Stephen Jackson.


> To understand the insanity that exists within this trade, just take a minute and look at the comparison between all the players' combined production for each team in this trade.
Bogut and Jackson: 21.8 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 5.6 APG, 24.8 PER, 40.2 FG%
Ellis, Udoh and Brown: 33.7 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 7.2 APG, 41.8 PER, 46.7 FG%
Aside from rebounds per game, the Warriors are the clear winners when it comes to every major statistical category. If you take out both players that are currently injured, Andrew Bogut and Kwame Brown, those statistics become that much more lopsided in the Bucks' favor. Not only are the Warriors sending away a significant amount of offensive production, they are also getting rid of three players that are much more efficient than the talent they are getting in return, which will certainly hold Golden State back this year and into the future. - Bleacher Report, 2012 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1103923-nba-trade-deadline-why-the-warriors-trading-away-monta-ellis-makes-no-sense


**The Warriors records before the 2012 Season:**

**- Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson drafted within this time**

**2009: 26-56**

**2010: 36-46**

**2011: 23-43**

**and then Draymond Green comes**

> Draymond Green is in a staring contest with history right now, and usually, history doesn’t blink first.
For the Golden State Warriors second-rounder, failure is practically assured.
But why? How can we be so certain of Green’s fate at such an early juncture in his career?
The answer is simple.
Green comes from the most historically cursed category of NBA players: He’s a Consensus First Team All-American who wasn’t drafted in the first round.
Moreover, scouts are virtually unanimous in saying that he knows how to play and has a terrific basketball IQ.
What he doesn’t have is a position.
There are concerns that Green, generously listed at 6’8” and 236 pounds, won’t be able to defend either forward spot in the NBA—not to mention that he’s had problems with his conditioning in the past.
So, the odds are stacked against Draymond Green.
If he puts together a solid career, he’ll buck the trend that no player like him has ever been able to.
For what it’s worth, I’m hopeful Green can break the mold into which he’s been cast. Maybe all 30 NBA GMs were wrong to let him slip out of the first round. It’s possible.
But history is standing firmly in front of Green, dispassionately staring him down. - Bleacher Report, 2012  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1248077-golden-state-warriors-why-history-dooms-draymond-green




**Then Golden State fires Mark Jackson after two straight playoff years**

> He continued to put his players in the best possible positions to succeed and grow, particularly his young core. Stephen Curry went from a good, young scorer to an NBA All-Star Game starter under Jackson. Klay Thompson went from a timid rookie to a fearless two-way force. Draymond Green went from being a second-round pick to being one of the most valuable bench players in the NBA.
Jackson's club was the league's third-best road team. His starting lineup had the best plus-minus in the NBA.
Since that article, Jackson's merit has only increased. He almost knocked the Los Angeles Clippers out of the playoffs despite not having Andrew Bogut—his best defensive player and rebounder—on the court. He kept his team together amid nearly unprecedented levels of conflict, deceit and paranoia within the organization. He was endorsed heavily by all of his players.
There are only 10 coaches in the league—at most—that did as good a job as Jackson did of maximizing their talent and getting their teams to buy in, compete and execute.
Jackson deserved to be the Warriors coach next season, and it is not even close. The problem is that ""deserve"" has nothing to do with it. Joe Lacob, Golden State's majority owner, did not want him to be the coach, and so he fired him.


> That's when the locker room starts to weaken. Curry starts to realize that the reason he wanted to be on the Warriors for his entire career was not something inherent about the team or location but rather the special atmosphere that Jackson had created.
Free agents that would have once flocked to Oakland at a discount (such as Iguodala did) start to shy away from signing in a place where the ownership has a history of breaking up successful, potential-laden teams due to ulterior motives.
As quickly as Lacob shed the darkness and dysfunction that had been plaguing the franchise for 20 years, the Jackson firing could ultimately trigger a rapid descent back into NBA obscurity as soon as 2017. - Bleacher Report, 2014 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1651457-mark-jackson-firing-reveals-true-priorities-of-golden-state-warriors-ownership


**Steve Kerr is hired**

> Ownership has spun this into the notion that the two-headed combination of Myers and Lacob had had enough of the offense and personal interaction issues. Steve Kerr ostensibly solves both of these problems at once. And yet, this still leaves open the door to the question as to whether the credentials were worth going this high and blind, flying all the way to Oklahoma City after their Game 6, to woo the guy they wanted?
> Kerr was and is Lacob's guy all along. For whatever reason it may be, he got what he wanted.
> If the team desired offensive innovation they could simply go with Mike D'Antoni and bank on the defenders to keep playing at their requisite talent. If they wanted a fresh face with coaching experience and a fun offense, there was Fred Hoiberg. Hell, they were even ready to interview Lionel Hollins, a coach that ran into most of the same problems Jackson was a part of near the end of the season.
> But Lacob's comfortability and connections led him to the glitzy hire of Steve Kerr. We just don't know what was so glitzy to begin with. - SBNation/Warriors , May 2014,  http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2014/5/15/5719552/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-coach-lacob


**In comes Kevin Durant**

> Kevin Durant could join the Warriors this summer. That is possible because, in the 2016 NBA offseason, almost anything is possible. The $1 billion in salary cap space and the lack of bad long-term contracts around the league open doors that would have been inconceivable in almost any other year.
The notion of Durant, the offseason’s top free agent, joining the Warriors, the NBA’s top team, is simple enough, as Sporting News has explained in the past. The notion of Durant joining the other foremost Western Conference power, however, is more complicated and perhaps more interesting. - Sporting News, May, 2016  

The East has Cleveland (FYI: Year 14 for LeBron next season), Boston’s Collection of Awesome Assets That Can’t Translate to an Actual Contender Yet, Whatever Toronto Is, Whatever Atlanta Was, Whatever Orlando and Milwaukee Might End Up Being, Whatever Pat Riley Might Have up His Sleeve and that’s about it.

He hasn’t made the Finals since 2012 for a variety of reasons: injuries, cheap owners, shaky coaching, bad luck, a stacked conference, and one dreadfully short-sighted trade (that’s becoming less and less dreadful as Steven Adams blossoms into a Kiwi warrior, but still). You can excuse all of those things and easily land at the following place: We should have won at least one title, it’s amazing that we didn’t, I can’t give up on this team yet.

> The Thunder, Spurs and Warriors already have meetings set up, according to a report from The Vertical. The Los Angeles teams want face-to-face talks. So do Miami, Boston, Houston, and New York.
> Another agent thinks, in the case of Durant, the club that wants to pry him away from the Thunder “needs to be a good team, in a better market with a better chance to win than OKC.”
> “So Golden State and Miami become the only real players,” the agent said. “It's too hard to justify a move to Los Angeles (Lakers) or New York because they are not close to winning. Houston's out.”
> Durant won't be touring city-to-city. The Vertical reported that Durant and his representation will host meetings at an undisclosed location in NYC, the homebase of Roc Nation. LeBron James had a similar strategy in 2010 when he set up meetings for teams to come to him in northeastern Ohio.
> Not since James has a free agent been as highly coveted as Durant, to be able to control the entire tempo and pace of free agency. Another agent, however, thinks Durant's free agency will be different from James' in one regard: Durant isn't playing general manager. - NewsOk, June, 2016 http://newsok.com/article/5506480



**...and there you have it.**

The Warriors built up this so called ""Super Team"" by players that they drafted. Steph Curry was a first round pick, but there were still mixed feelings about him when he was drafted. Thompson was heralded, but people were worried about the weed arrest. Alot of people thought that neither one these players would be Stars. The trade of Monta Ellis for Bogut and others, was ridiculed at the time. Even I questioned that, because Ellis was really good at the time.  The Warriors go the playoffs two straight years , only to have Mark jackson be fired. At the time, I hated it. I thought it was stupid. I thought that the Warriors would regress because of this. Of course that was wrong. 

The Warriors have also picked up decent free agents along the way like Andre Iguodala and Shawn Livingston. Both ended up being great additions. The Warriors built their core through the draft and supplemented that through smart , veteran Free Agent picks. 

> Andre Iguodala won’t ever win an NBA championship until he’s paid correctly and plays with truly better players than himself on offense. It’s inconvenient for whatever team overpays him this summer, but it’s the truth. - HuffPost, July, 2013  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jake-fischer/the-incovenient-truth-abo_b_3530424.html



> Livingston is a beast of a defender, capable of handling both guard spots and most small forwards. His length, physicality and smarts make him yet another fantastic wing stopper on a Golden State roster that already has one of the league's best in Andre Iguodala.
> Slotting him into backcourt lineups alongside Stephen Curry will allow the Dubs to hide their franchise point guard on the weakest available matchup. And if the Dubs want to get particularly nasty on defense, they can put a flat-out-terrifying combination of Livingston, Iguodala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut on the floor together. - Bleacher Report, July, 2014 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2116632-does-shaun-livingston-signing-make-klay-thompson-more-expendable-for-warriors

The Warriors got to the state that they in by making shrewd moves. Fortunately for them , these moves paid off. Trades, Free Agents, Draft picks, Coach firings, it all could have went either way. This was not a team that went out and constructed a Big 3 in Free Agency. They drafted and groomed their Big 3 organically. Yes, they added Kevin Durant, but Durant had other suitors. He talked to other teams who did not do enough or have enough to wow him. The Warriors had the cap space and they signed the FREE agent. 

There was a void. Harrison Barnes was that void. We already know how bad he was in the Finals. The Warriors wanted to be able to beat the Cavs, so they got better. Kevin Durant is available and the job of every team is to constantly improve. The Warriors would be doing a disservice to themselves and their fans if they did not pursue him. He was free to choose and there was nothing wrong with this. 

There are fans who are now complaining and saying that the league needs to do something, but the Warriors did nothing wrong and Durant did nothing wrong. The Durant signing was there biggest Free Agent signing in years. This was a team built through the draft and I can't stress that enough.  I keep repeating that when Curry, Klay and Draymond were drafted  most did not see any of them being stars, so lets not act like these were overly hyped draft picks.

**The Warriors built their team the right way Its almost similar to how Jerry West helped build the Lakers in the late 90s/early 00s and then to go to the Warriors in 2011**

> After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award.[49] By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West laid down the fundamentals of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.[1] On May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber.[52][53] This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team.[54] In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive. - Jerry West, Wikipedia

the bottom line is, if other NBA teams want to win, then maybe they should follow the blueprint of the Golden State Warriors. You have a clear vision that you follow, you make smart draft picks, you build team chemistry even at the expense of trading favorite players (Ellis), you put smart basketball people in key positions in your franchise (West), You take chances at the Coaching position even if it doesnt make sense at the time (Kerr), you take chances and add players other teams dont  really want (Iggy, Livingston, Javelle), You make your team as a good as possible by going after and acquiring the best player in Free Agency when you have the chance (Durant).  None of this ""ruins"" the league.",0.52,controversial,2017-06-04 17:16:44

He's 37 years old, on a team that is going absolutely nowhere this season with or without him jacking up shots. They are full tank mode, and Kobe brought the Lakers 5 rings in his time there. If nothing else, this is showing how much respect the Lakers organization has for their perennial all-star.. It's going to be REALLY hard for Kevin Durant(or any other superstar) to pass on an opportunity like LA when they see that not only can they build a team around them as they did Kobe, but they are going to pay them later on in their career if they prove to deserve it; like Kobe did. God knows how much Kobe made in his career for the Lakers, and for himself.

He already has so much weight on his shoulders, and that he decides to put it all on him again is so sad but also so brave.

LeBron doesn't owe anybody anything. He didn't owe us an Instagram post. He didn't have to publicy share his feelings, his grief, his cries. Yet he did.

They had a 7 month long investigation into their Organization, both front and back office, that concluded that they had been fostering sexual harassment for over two decades. Now in each Porzingis post I see so many upvoted comments about how well their front office communicates and how they have a tight circle of management. I know organizational disfunction doesn’t directly relate to player management but I reject the notion that those two aren’t correlated at all.

**Atlanta Hawks**

With Blazers

Receive- Anfernee Simmons, Gary Trent Jr. 2019 2nd rd pick

Give- Taurean Prince 

Reasoning- The Blazers add a wing to take minutes from Turner and Moe Harkless, who have both been questionable. Prince gives them a solid defensive presence. The Hawks add 2 young pieces and help the tankathon, Prince likely isn't in their future plans anyway.

**Boston Celtics**

With Pelicans

Receive- Anthony Davis, Wesley Johnson

Give- Jaylen Brown, Kings 2019 1st, Clippers 2019 1st, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojelye 

Reasoning, I understand this trade is ridiculous, but finding a trade for the Celtics is really hard when they don't have any holes. Exploring trades with Rozier is kind of difficult because he's the only bench PG for the Celtics and they need the depth. For the Pelicans, this deal would avoid a long turnover process and you get the deal in before it turns into a Jimmy Butler to move up 6 spots in the draft and some filler, or boogie cousins for a centerpiece around Buddy Hield

**Brooklyn Nets**

with 76ers

Receive- Fultz, Korkmaz

Give- Dudley, Dinwiddie

Reasoning- Dinwiddie is expiring and the Nets get a high potential prospect for pretty cheap, all things considered, they need to see if DRuss can handle a full-time pg role before they pay him anyway. For the 76ers, they get a much needed shooter and just added bench scoring with dinwiddie, or he could start, but I would like to see Dinwiddie on a playoff team.

**Charlotte Hornets**

With Suns

Receive- Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Ryan Anderson

Give- Kemba Walker, Nicholas Batum

Reasoning- Although I don't think they trade Kemba, and there's a good case for why they shouldn't; the Hornets are capitalizing on Kemba's highest value as they not only pull 2 young guys with good potential. Even if Jackson has been bad so far, he still has a decent ceiling and Bridges is a young asset. They also save 4m in cap room the next 2 years and get out of the contract 1 year sooner with the Anerson for Batum swap. The Suns fill out they're backcourt with a dominant scorer. 

**Chicago Bulls**

With Wizards

Receive- Kelly Oubre Jr.

Give- Bobby Portis

All about needs here, as the Wizards need to fill a hole at big man, especially how bad they are rebounding right now and the Bulls, although they don't need wing scoring, Oubre isn't an awful defender and probably gives them a better SF option that Justin Holiday, Denzel Valentine or Chandler Hutchinson.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

With Houston Rockets

Receive- Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss

Give- George Hill

For the Cavs, they get to essentially shave a year off of Hill's contract with Knight and Chriss expiring, also they get to see if they want to hold on to Chriss, who could be a rotational guy in the future. For the Rockets, they get a much needed consistent 3rd ball-handler, they can stop forcing MCW out there.

**Detroit Pistons**

With Charlotte Hornets

Receive- Kemba Walker

Give- Ish Smith, Luke Kennard, Khyri Thomas, 2019 1st, 2021 1st (top 3 protected)

For the Pistons, they get their big 3 so to speak and give themselves a 2nd legitimate scoring option. For the Horents, they get a young shooter in Kennard, but also 2 1sts that can help them rebuild once they get out of these awful contracts, a pistons team in 2021 could be very bad if Blake doesn't keep this season up and who knows if Kemba stays in Detroit. 

**Indiana Pacers**

with Wizards

Receive- Bradley Beal, Kelly Oubre Jr.

Give- Myles Turner, Cory Joseph, Thaddeus Young, 2019 1st

Reasoning- The Pacers seem to not have anyone adding a ton of production behind Oladipo, Sabonis and the occasional Bogdanovic momentum 3 ball. Adding Beal would give them another deep scoring option on a good contract. The Wizards pull out a solid young center that can be a piece for the future and possibly help Wall right some of his wrongs, cause I think losing Gortat hurts Wall more than the public, or Wall, thinks. They also get a 1st in the deal and keep relevance this season with 3 guys that can play.

**Miami Heat**

With Rockets

Give- James Johnson, Justice Winslow

Get, Brandon Knight, 2019 1st

Reasoning- Heat get out of the Johnson deal in style, acquiring a 1st round pick in the process, Knight being expiring doesn't really hurt them in the long run and I don't know if they planned on resigning Winslow anyway. For the Rockets, they get deeper to start and add 2 guys that can defend how they like, in a way replacing Trevor Ariza, obviously not quite the shooters like Ariza was at points but regardless adding wing defenders is never a bad idea.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

With Magic

Give- Tony Snell, 2019 1st

Get- Evan Fournier

Reasoning- For the bucks, it's fairly obvious, they add another wing scoring option that can fit directly into their lineup. Fournier might be having an off year so far but he's a pretty solid guard that can add a good bit to their lineup, possibly can play the Korver role in Bud's offense. For the Magic, they don't really need Fournier, he's also at 17m and taking Snell cuts 7m off of that, adding the 1st round pick is exciting for the team as well. 

**New York Knicks**

With Kings

Give- Courtney Lee, 2020 1st

Get- Iman Shumpert, Harry Giles

Reasoning- For the Knicks, they get more money, for what they hope is a big offseason by unloading Courtney Lee's 2 year contract and they add a decent young guy in Harry Giles. For the Kings, they get to watch as the Knicks swing and miss on every free agent in 2019 and are back in the lottery in 2020. 

**Orlando Magic**

With Pelicans

Give- Terrance Ross

Receive- Soloman Hill, 2019 2nd

Reasoning- A small trade here that nets the Magic a 2nd rounder and gives the Pelicans some added 3pt shooting. Hill and Ross are both expiring, so the money isn't really impacted either way.

**Philadephia 76ers**

With Bulls

Give- Markelle Fultz

Get- Bobby Portis, Cam Payne

Reasoning- The 76ers likely can solve their issue at back up center with adding Portis and open up enough money this offseason for a max player. Probably the most they'll get for Fultz. Cam Payne just to make salaries work, he's an expiring anyway. The Bulls just lose a piece that probably wasn't going to help them win this season and get a lottery ticket in Markelle

**Toronto Raptors**

With Trail Blazers

Give- Norman Powell

Get- Al Faruq-Aminu, Caleb Swanigan

Reasoning- Making a trade for the Raptors is very difficult because they're filled out, but Norm has been a question mark this year and I suppose getting a consistent stretch 4/wing helps them and Swanigan can provide depth at the big spot if they're in a pinch. The Blazers, get a wing to take minutes away from Turner and Harkless.

**Washington Wizards**

With Heat

Give- John Wall

Get- Goran Gragic

Reasoning- The Wizards escape the Wall contract in the final year they can while likely not dropping off too much and who knows, possibly new blood can help the team turn something around. For the Heat they give Wall a fresh a start, they seem to be a team content with being decent and just hovering in the playoffs until something breaks for them and Wall could help give them that, even at a bad contract, you don't get a player at Wall's caliber any cheaper and I think he could be better in Miami than Washington.

**Dallas Mavericks**

With Heat

Give- J.J. Barea, Ray Spalding

Get- Justice Winslow

Reasoning- The Mavs need a wing defender, they simply are lacking someone that can lock up the wing consistently and although they hate to move Barea, They open up minutes for Brunson and still have Devin Harris. Meanwhile the Heat don't have a true back up point, Tyler Johnson can run it, but their team would look a lot better if he could play off ball full time. 

**Denver Nuggets**

With Grizzlies

Give- Mason Plumlee, Jarred Vanderbilt

Get- Garret Temple, Marshon Brooks, Ivan Rabb

Reasoning- I couldn't find a trade for the Nuggets for the life of me, please forgive this trade, I guess they get a 2nd ball handler in Garret Temple, but like I said I really could not find a logical trade for the nuggets

**Golden State Warriors**

With Cavaliers

Give- Quinn Cook, Jacob Evans, 2019 1st

Get- Larry Nance Jr.

Reasoning, Nance gives them an athletic 4 that can play the 5 in a pinch and possible protection if Draymond leaves for more depth at that spot. Losing the 30th pick, Quinn Cook and Jacob Evans doesn't really hurt them and the Cavs push toward tanking and add another draft pick to help fill out their roster next year for what should be another tankathon.

**Houston Rockets**

With Knicks

Give- Brandon Knight, Zhou Qi, 2019 1st

Get- Tim Hardaway Jr.

Reasoning- The Rockets need more rotational guys, if Hardaway can simply play in the playoffs for them he helps them immensely, he can be the spot up shooter that melo wasn't. For the Knicks they open up a lot of money this upcoming season and get a late 1st, which gives them the ability to turn this offseason into a big one.

**Los Angeles Clippers**

With Trail Blazers

Give- Patrick Beverley, Sindarious Thornwell

Get- Zach Collins, Jake Layman

Reasoning- The Clippers are another tough team to find a trade for cause their plan is pretty well laid out at this point. However this trade gives them another young piece to their already rich core. And for the Blazers they get a much needed defending guard and a ball handler definitely doesn't hurt them.

**Los Angeles Lakers**

With Suns

Give- Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, 2019 1st

Get- Devin Booker

Reasoning- Yes this is absurd, yes this will never happen but it actually has some logic on paper. It's hard to make a reasonable trade for the lakers right now because so many guys are restricted from trades due to being signed recently. So the Lakers obviously get a great young player who will be able to get his own 30 and take the load off of LeBron but i'm sure thats not the part that fans are upset about. The Suns might see that Ingram has been close to as good as Booker the past 2 seasons and Kuzma is what Kuzma is but is still young, they get to widen their young core. I know they would never do this but it's more of a thought provoking trade cause I can't make a real one based on reasons thrown out at the beginning.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

With Mavericks

Give- Chandler Parsons, 2021 1st

Get- Wesley Matthews, J.J. Barea

Reasoning- The Grizzlies get out of the Parsons contract and open up their room for someone next season, and add J.J. Barea this season, an improvement over Mack. Matthews isn't bad either. The Mavericks could use an extra 1st after losing one to go get Doncic.

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

With Hornets

Get- Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lamb

Give- Tyus Jones, Taj Gibson, 2019 1st

Reasoning- T-Wolves get a star and complete their lineup with Kemba, Wiggins, Covington, Saric and Towns. Improving from Teague. And they add Lamb as a solid piece. The Hornets add a young player, and expiring contract and what should be a draft pick in the early 20's possibly late teens, not a bad haul for the UConn guard.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

With Knicks

Give- Soloman Hill, Cheick Diallo, 2019 1st

Give- Tim Hardaway Jr.

Reasoning- The Kicks get a 1st for a contract they probably don't want all that much now, and the Pelicans get a good wing to help outside. It helps possibly convince AD to stay as well. 

**Oklahoma City Thunder**

With Kings and Spurs

Give- Andre Roberson to Spurs, Hamidou Diallo, 2020 & 2021 2nd to Kings

Get- Bodgan Bogdanovich

Spurs give Patty Mills to Kings

Reasoning- This is assuming the Kings come back down into the mid to low lottery, but they add Diallo, who honestly has been pretty decent in limited minutes, adding 2 2nds and getting 9m this offseason due to Patty Mills expiring. The Thunder's defense has been good without Roberson and I think they're going to want to continue giving Ferguson minutes, adding a shooter really helps them and they can trot out a much better starting 5. The Spurs need something defensively and badly, they rank 29th in defensive rtg and Roberson you'd imagine helps that, Derrick White and Bryn Forbes can handle PG for a bit at least. Derozan would probably be the primary ball handler though.

**Phoenix Suns**

With Pacers

Give- T.J. Warren

Get- Thaddeus Young, 2020 1st

Reasoning- The suns get a draft pick that probably won't be high but still adds an asset, I don't know if Warren exactly fits with their time table. Young has had a bad season so far and if you're the Pacers, Warren is a very versatile forward that can score pretty easily. He helps their chances this season a lot.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

With Nets

Give- Al-Faruq Aminu, Wade Baldwin, 2019 2nd

Get- D'Angelo Russell

Reasoning- This is assuming the Nets don't plan on bringing back Russell, which I don't think they do and he goes elsewhere this summer, so at least they get something of value for him. Baldwin is a young asset and a 2nd round pick never hurt, also this is a assuming they aren't part of the playoff picture in the near future. For the Blazers, they finally get a good bench guard where they are lacking heavily, losing aminu sucks, cause I like Aminu, but they still have Zach Collins and Leonard, who play that 4 spot a lot. 

**Sacramento Kings**

With Rockets

Give- Willy Cauley-Stien

Get- Marquese Chriss, Zhou Qi

Reasoning- The kings definitely aren't bringing back Cauley-Stien anyway, so why not turn him into 2 more young guys for your team? also helps with the whole tanking thing, assuming they will be back there this season. If they continue how they have been this trade isn't logical. For the Rockets, they are mediocre in points in the paint allowed and at the very least Cauley-Stien is an option to help that without giving up much at all for him.

**San Antonio Spurs**

With Trail Blazers

Give- LaMarcus Aldridge

Get- Evan Turner, Zach Collins, Wade Baldwin, 2019 1st, 2021 2nd

Reasoning- If the Spurs start to falter, they might not want to be in that Aldridge deal for long, and adding Collins, Baldwin and a 1st can help restart this. The Spurs are hard to find a trade for due to their recently signed players and not clear direction quite yet so the trade is more so of an idea that I think they could pursue. 

**Utah Jazz**

With Wizards

Give- Ricky Rubio, Thabo Sefolosha, Tony Bradley, 2019, 2021 1st

Get- Bradley Beal

Reasoning- Jazz get a solid extra scorer, in an offense that seems stagnant if Mitchell is cold. Mitchell moving to point could be good for the offense as Rubio has seen plenty of troubles this season and we have seen the Mitchell at PG work in the playoffs last season. I think it gives their lineup a lot more options. For the Wizards, if they want to blow it up, this might be the way to do it. They get to take away all of Beal's money while adding 2 1st round picks. 

&#x200B;

So thats it, tell me how bad these are, and maybe which ones you could see actually going through, I realize that a lot of these likely have some problems in them with who gets what but they are all trades that can legally happen under the NBA trading rules, through ESPN trade machine.

Which was literally one play to stop Steph from tying after Kyrie’s 3. Let’s not pretend like our average starting forward couldn’t do exactly what he did for one possession.

He was literally outplayed by Tristan Thompson and JR Smith. He scored only 2.8 more ppg than **35 year old Richard Jefferson**.

The only impactful thing he did was grab 14 rebounds in Game 7 and have one good defensive stop. 

I get that he was dealing with concussion symptoms, but that doesn’t mean he contributed to the series being won. **Kyrie had to play like the best PG of all time** to make up for his absence.",0.52,controversial,2018-05-26 22:29:34

He is doing unspeakable things to NBA teams and taking his team to the number 1 seed over the more talented Warriors team. Also wears Wesley Johnson’s ankles as a necklace. Harden is twice as good as Steph at drawing fouls and contact, a very valuable asset in a player because it puts the opposing teams best defenders in foul trouble. He leads the league in three point makes and is shooting 39% at the same volume of 3s as Curry. He absolutely stuffs the stat sheet in ways Curry cannot do, rebounding, assisting and scoring much more than Curry over the last 4 years. He’s also only assisted on 30% of his baskets, while Curry hovers at around 60% assisted.

Curry is the definition of efficiency. He has the highest true shooting percentage of a guard of all time currently. He’s second in the league in 3 point makes, but on 3% higher efficiency than Harden and about 6 fewer games played. He’s got two MVPs, one unanimous and has seen the NBA Finals 3 times, conquering them twice in the process. He consistently leads the league in box +/-, RPM, VORP, and a slew of other advanced stats. His reputation as the greatest shooter of all time gives him a special gravity that opens up the floor for his teammates that not many in NBA history can make claim to. Like James, Curry also owns Wesley Johnson, but as more of a subset of owning the entire Clippers franchise since 2014.

90,[SERIOUS] Prime Wade vs Prime Kobe,0,20h8zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/20h8zt/serious_prime_wade_vs_prime_kobe/,233,1394918795.0,"So disclaimer: I am a Wade fan and am doing this because I just found out there are Laker fans on /r/nba who think prime Wade in no way compares to prime Kobe. 

So while I might be doing this because I'm admittedly a little salty, I think it's actually a good discussion and one we can have because both players' primes are clearly over. 

Some quick stats I gathered just as a starting point (if people post more I will definitely add them here, especially for defense which is really hard to measure), and to show that they really are a very good comparison:

This isn't a knock against him, but all these posts about him being GOAT, him being the league's best player (ignoring LeBron, Curry, Durant, Harden, etc.), can't help but shake my head.

Maybe he ends up being the game's greatest winner (like this generation's version of Bill Russell), but he isn't good enough individually at this point to top the stats and accolades of LeBron, Harden, Durant and Curry. Being the greatest winner is different from being the best player.

Before anyone says ""hurr durr stats don't mean anything"", clearly, they mean something, else why would be keeping them? Stats matter in context to performance. Kawhi doesn't have the stats yet. And if he continues all this load management crap, he won't ever. Seriously, take a look at the career stats of everyone I mentioned above and compare with Kawhi's. Statistically, this year was Kawhi's best season, and they're not even eye-popping in comparison to everyone else's best season. And he only did them in 60 games! 

Everyone else is an anomaly or stat freak. **You need to be both a stat freak and ALSO be a winner to be top player-worthy**, much less GOAT-worthy.

And yes I'm aware as a Knicks fan that they will try and offer him one of their max slots, but based on his court vision in several plays this game, Meyer's will not be fooled into playing for our team.

Bagley will retire as an all-time bust despite likely developing into a completely serviceable role player and at-times starter for the rest of his career, and it’s entirely due to reasons out of his control. The fact that the Kings had access to such talent, and just completely swung and missed is so frustrating. The Kings front office missed what was obvious to even us shitposters on /r/NBA_DRAFT is astonishing. I’ve seen draft blunders, but picking a big who isn’t all that skilled, doesn’t have a plus wingspan or defensive versatility over what looks to be a historic player in Luka Doncic should solidify Vlade as a joke. 

As Danny Ainge is fond of saying- ownership is the biggest competitive advantage in the NBA.

The Lakers no longer have a great second max contract option this summer since CP3, PG13, and Durant have all re-upped.  

They sign Lebron for a max 1+1 and he gets to buddy up with Carmelo for a year.  They don’t make the Kawhi trade, and use it as a feeling-out year to see which of the young guys fit well next to Bron, and how well Walton and Bron fit.  Low pressure, low expectations in year 1.  This is a non-playoff year and the Lakers will have their own ‘19 pick.  

Then in the summer of ‘19 they re-sign Lebron, sign Kawhi to a max, and use those two Thunder future first-rounders and their own future first rounders add a third elite player that is already under contract somewhere else.  

At that point - summer of ‘19 - Deng’s deal would only have one year remaining, and cap space opens wide up next year with the cap going up 7 million and many bad deals going off the books.  The Lakers could use the final year of Deng’s deal and those future Thunder first-rounders to add another elite player under contract with another team (an opted in and traded Jimmy Butler or Khris Middleton for example).  

This plan would mean the Lakers were probably a non-playoff team in 18-19 with Lebron and Carmelo, but set themselves up to be loaded in 19-20:

Lebron, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler or Middleton, AND all their current young guys, who still wouldn’t be expensive yet.  

The Thunder would do that Carmelo deal because it would save them $100M+ in repeater tax bills next year.  It saves them more money to completely clear Carmelo’s salary than it would to buy him out or stretch him.

The first was LeBron putting pressure on the paint and scoring or opening up the 3 point attack. The other was the CONSISTENT iso scoring Kyrie Irving would provide against any defender in the NBA. Despite the stories, LeBron didn't have to do too much in any game to win (by his standards, of course). On a good night, all LeBron had to do was get 20 to 25 and Kyrie could guarantee 20 to 30 points (Love would sprinkle in 15 to 20) with Isolations and transition. Lue didn't really have to design an offensive system because so much scoring was guaranteed from 3 players. Believe it or not, LeBron had the easiest time he's had in his NBA career. Even in Miami, Wade's non-shooting clogged the paint. Now in Cleveland, LeBron's workload was cut in half with the spacing and iso scoring Kyrie provided. Kyrie led the Cavs in shots and usage last year because of it. Kyrie in Cleveland would have extended LeBron's career to the max because he could literally stand still and watch Kyrie Iso. Now, everything looks difficult for  Cleveland. No one can mimic what Kyrie did for the Cavs. In fact, only James Harden could possibly fill that Shooting/ISO void for LeBron. The sad part is that a 25-year-old LeBron could run this team to 60 wins, but he doesn't have the energy to score 30 and get open shots for the shooter every night.

I would be willing to bet that most people here would rank basketball, football, hockey and soccer in the top 4. People like team sports. People also like sports that involve a myriad of skills and actions. The more variables that affect success in a game, provided those variables work together in an interpret-able and logical way, the more fun it is. I am not stating that as fact, but as an opinion that it probably does not take a leap of faith for most of you to agree with. 

Basketball is a game that involves so many skills. Jump shooting, Set shooting, lay-ups, dunks, passing, dribbling, rebounding, posting up... I could go on for a long time. But not every player can do each one at the same level. What makes basketball beautiful is the team-work can make imperfect players play the game at near perfect levels. 

- Dirk Nowitzki? That can't rebound well or protect the rim for shit. Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler? World champions. 

- Steph Curry? Guy is great on one side of the ball, but he's so weak he gets beat just as bad on the other end. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green? Well, shit, we don't have *4 guys* who can torch him. 

- LeBron James? He is the most rounded player ever, but his jump shot is pretty inconsistent - he's only a good scorer if he is getting to the rack. LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Shane Battier, Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers? How you gonna stop that man when there is nobody even near the rack?!?!

You can probably see my point. Every player, even LeBron, has strengths and weakness. The beauty of basketball is finding a way to leverage peoples' greatness and cover for their weakness to put the best possible product on the floor. That's why I love it, at least. 

Because of dumb, outdated fouling rules, there is one skill that a team cannot find a way to mask. DeAndre Jordan is probably just as bad at dribbling as he is at shooting, but that doesn't keep him out of the game because his team is full of playmakers. Ricky Rubio couldn't finish a happy meal, but as long as his teammates can they have a chance. But if a player can't make FTs the other team can eliminate the relevance of every other skill in the game. You can't even stop the other team from putting your player on the line by not giving him the ball. You literally have to take him out of the game. How ridiculous is that? 

People talk about DeAndre and Dwight as if they are some extreme outliers that are the only source of the issue. As if its a sheer matter of practice that is holding him back, and that's on him. But there have always been and always will be lots of good basketball players that struggle with FTs, as there are lots who struggle with defense.  Most of these guys aren't factors in playoff series so they don't face hack-a too often, but if they were the Plumlees, Drummond, Whiteside, Sanders, Perkins, Ed Davis, Mahinmi would all face the issue. Dwight and DeAndre are so damn good at everything else that they are the only two players whose lack of touch doesn't prevent them from being stars on playoff teams. They aren't being punished for being outliers for their bad FT shooting, they are being punished for being too good at everything else (or some other things, more accurately). 

Basketball will always be a sport where great teams are more than the sum of their parts because teammates can make up for any weaknesses. If you support current Hack-A-Shaq rules, you are effectively saying that applies to everything except FT shooting.

If you really feel that way, go watch darts. Its basically the same fucking thing. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold and thanks for all the good discussion. It has come to my attention that the reason people are so committed to the ""learn to make you free throws"" defense is because people think that FTs are just a matter of fundamentals and practice, unlike many other skills which require certain genetic traits. Maybe this is the case because a lot of  people don't ever get into basketball without playing it to a degree, and most average height people don't play much unless they have a pretty good natural shooting stroke. I dunno, that seems far-fetched, but its gotta be something.

As a 6'8 (out of shoes, so NBA 6'10"") forward who is wet from mid range and even 3, but has always struggled from the line, I assure you that is not the case. FT shooting is definitely something you can improve, but the range is absolutely different for different people. While DJ's 43% seems particularly low, a lot of really good players have been poor FT shooters and to question all of their work ethic is pretty presumptuous.",0.5,controversial,2015-07-14 19:48:09

And I mean **shit on hard**. It's rude, it's unfair, and it's just plain wrong.

Take DeAndre Jordan for instance. Guy just got a great contract. For the first time, he's pursued and courted by *multiple* teams(in playoff contention i might add). So Mark Cuban of the Mavs compliments him, calling him their soon-to-be franchise player. Now, everyone's shitting on him, insulting him for his free throws, his lack of offense. Basically all his strengths are ignored and all his weaknesses are magnified through a whale-sized telescope.

Come on guys. You don't have to like the player. Hell, you could even hate him. But be respectful! He's a human being just like the rest of us. Some of the comments I read here just blow my mind. It's borderline toxic!

#Western Conference

1. **Houston Rockets**, 58-24. This Russ/Harden combo is going underrated, and the Rockets have potential for another magnificent regular season like their 65-17 season two years ago. That probably won't happen again, but CP3 -> Russ upgrade is still pretty significant, both because CP3 is starting to decline and because he has had availability issues. Russ helps to mitigate some issues and is good on defense as well as athleticism. The Rockets have also returned their core players (Gordon/Tucker/Capela/etc.) so there is still some continuity. 
2. **Denver Nuggets**, 56-26. Denver is high-key really good, and MPJ is looking great in preseason. Unless he proves that he can stay healthy, he won't be a difference maker, but who knows at this point? The Nuggets' young players should hopefully continue to grow, and hopefully Jamal doesn't go full Wiggins after securing the bag.
3. **Utah Jazz**, 55-27. The Jazz have upgraded significantly this offseason by adding a borderline All-Star in Conley and then also adding Bojan, who was a big factor for the Pacers staying afloat after Oladipo's injury last year. With a good amount of depth, the Jazz should be in the upper tier of the regular season teams.
4. **Golden State Warriors**, 52-30. Note that this ranking assumes a healthy Curry (75+ games) and that Klay returns after All-Star break. If not, they will be a lot lower. With healthy Curry, the Warriors are still contenders. Expect him to put up insane numbers this year and carry harder than any non-Harden player has done in recent memory. They could pull a trade for D'Lo since I don't expect him to mesh that well with GS's system when Klay comes back, but it depends on how he does.
5. **Los Angeles Lakers**, 51-31. One extended injury to LeBron forcing another January vacation or to Anthony Day to Davis could throw the Lakers out of the playoffs. The Lakers will practice some load management either way to keep their stars healthy for the playoffs, so don't expect them to be in the top part of the standings. Don't let their record deceive you, though -- come playoff time, the Lakers are firmly in the upper echelon of the league, with an outstanding duo (if healthy) and good complimentary pieces.
6. **Los Angeles Clippers**, 50-32. The Clippers will manage the hell out of Kawhi's load after seeing how that worked out for the Raptors last year. He'll probably play 60 games or so, and given that Paul George will miss probably a month or so at the start of the season, we will not see the full extent of what the Clippers can do until the playoffs. Like the Lakers, don't let their record deceive you. Fully healthy and non-load managing, the Clippers are contenders.
7. **Dallas Mavericks**, 47-35. Their record also depends on health and load management as KP comes back from his ACL injury. However, the roster is solid enough to keep them afloat even with some management, as Luka has proven to be able to carry the team at points, and if we get a jump from him, this seeding is definitely realistic for the Mavs. The bench is also fairly deep, especially with Point God JJ Barea's early return from injury. The Mavs will surprise people, and could even have two All-Stars.
8. **Portland Trail Blazers**, 45-37. This last spot is a tossup between several good teams, but Portland, with the best player among all of them, gets the nod. Lillard is still an elite PG and should keep the team rolling despite the loss of Nurkic and some roster overhaul. I don't like a lot of their roster moves this offseason (losing Kanter is big for them, who stepped up majorly after Nurkic went down, Whiteside and old af Pau won't fill that role much), though, so I don't expect them to do as well as they did last year.
9. **San Antonio Spurs**, 44-38. I keep thinking that it's finally gonna happen, but Pop proves me wrong each year. This year, unfortunately, is probably when that magical run ends. The west has too many teams for the Spurs to keep defying odds each time, although still expect the Spurs to have a winning record, of course. DeMar is great but not that All-NBA player that took the Raptors to the #1 seed anymore, and LMA is very good for his age but how long can he keep it up? The rest of the roster is good, with a lot of solid pieces, but not good enough to be top 8 this year, most likely.
10. **Sacramento Kings**, 42-40. The Kings will push through with a winning record for the first time in quite a while, but as is the case with the Spurs, the west is too stacked for them to make it into the playoffs. I do think the Kings need another piece to add to their current core before they can expect to contend for the playoffs, so it might be better off for them to stay in the lottery this year, honestly.
11. **New Orleans Pelicans**, 38-44. The Pelicans are good on paper, but giving plenty of their key minutes to young players/rookies will probably not do them very well when trying to make a playoff push. This is a playoff team in the east for sure (probably on Orlando's tier, with a good crowd of young players and established vet All-Stars in Jrue/Vuc) but in the west, not so much. I'm excited to see Zion throughout the regular season, and I think he can be massive for them going forward, both literally and figuratively.
12. **Oklahoma City Thunder**, 35-47. The roster looks alright, but let's be honest: Gallo is trade bait and will certainly not be on the team anymore post-trade deadline, and same deal with Adams. CP3 will be on the team solely because his contract is an albatross, and OKC would have to part with assets to acquire him unless it's for Wall or Wiggins straight up. Now that we mention it... Wiggins on OKC would be interesting. Would he be a permanent MVP-level player now? But either way, the Thunder are not a playoff team, but certainly not bad. They will keep close to .500 pre-trade deadline, most likely.
13. **Phoenix Suns**, 31-51. I'm hyped to see Ayton this year, and I think he could continue developing into a true beast that makes people stop asking why the Suns didn't draft Luka. The roster is improved from last year, no doubt, with the additions of Saric and Rubio. These are not season-changing players, but in the case of the Suns, who need a PG desperately, Rubio may make a huge impact that launches the team past the 30-win mark.
14. **Minnesota Timberwolves**, 28-54. Let's be honest, this team is ass outside of KAT and RoCo. The Butler trade was a huge mistake -- if they didn't make it, they'd be working with KAT, LaVine, and Lauri to build around (and maybe Wiggins might be good in this hypothetical timeline), but now they are straight up wasting KAT's early years. The Wolves will probably take this season to grab another high draft pick, because they are probably not going to sniff the playoffs this year. Without KAT, this team is probably worst in the league.
15. **Memphis Grizzlies**, 25-57. Bad this year, but with a bright future. The roster is also bad, although they have multiple young studs in Ja, JJJ, and Valanciunas. They will probably finish worst in the west without a Booker or KAT-level player to carry them out of the cellar. It would also be nice to convey the protected (top 6) pick to Boston this year so they can go forward without any pick obligations, but if they vault to #1 or something, they certainly won't complain.

#Eastern Conference

1. **Milwaukee Bucks**, 57-25. The Bucks are a deep team, and Giannis is looking to go on a revenge tour after getting bounced in the ECF. The team is worse than last year due to the loss of Brogdon, but made up for it in part with some decent signings (other Lopez, Korver, Wes Matthews), so they should still be elite in the regular season. 
2. **Philadelphia 76ers**, 54-28. The 76ers are going to be very good, but I think they are being a little overrated here on r/nba. The Bucks are still better all-around, and losing Butler will be big for Philly, who relied on him a lot to close games. The defense will be very good, but I'm skeptical of their ability to earn the #1 seed.
3. **Boston Celtics**, 50-32. If the Celtics have a fully healthy Hayward, they can challenge one of the top two teams in the playoffs. If he's similar to last year, not so much. The Celtics are very weak in the middle, and expect them to swing a trade for some good center this year. Other than that, they are probably not going to be better than last year.
4. **Miami Heat**, 47-35. The Heat will be pretty good with Butler -- not contenders, but due to how weak the east is, they will get a good seed. Their roster is solid this year, although I don't have much else to say about them other than that they will be good. 
5. **Orlando Magic**, 46-36. I'm excited to see Fultz hopefully have a bounce-back season and lead the Magic to a good seed in the playoffs. Isaac will continue to progress, as will AG and hopefully Bamba. Vucevic is still an All-Star, and will probably repeat as one if the Magic are this high when it comes time for voting. I think the Magic are a dark horse and could go as high as the 3rd seed if everything goes right.
6. **Toronto Raptors**, 45-37. While the defending champions, the Raptors did lose, of course, their best player and another very important piece to their success, so they will probably not have a top seed, but are going to return to the playoffs nonetheless. They may part with some of their non-Lowry core (Ibaka, Gasol) in trades if they get a good enough offer.
7. **Indiana Pacers**, 44-38. With Oladipo out for some time, don't expect the Pacers to be as high as they were pre-injury last year (3rd). Losing Bojan also hurts a lot, but Brogdon and Warren helps a bit. If Oladipo makes a timely return, the Pacers should be back in the playoffs, although if he stays out too long, they are in danger.
8. **Brooklyn Nets**, 44-38. Also a good team, but without KD, I don't expect them to land too high. If KD is back in the playoffs, then things could change, but I don't think the Nets will risk it by bringing him back early. Now if he was healthy the whole season at 100%, the Nets would probably be a 2nd seed.
9. **Detroit Pistons**, 43-39. The Pistons look good, but unfortunately, with 9 playoff-caliber teams in the east, one has to miss out, and it's most likely to be Detroit. Note that the 4 to 9 seeds are all within 4 games, so a lot can change with injuries. I see the top 3 as fixed, but 4-9 is fluid and there are definitely some scenarios where the Pistons can be in the picture (Magic young guys regress, Raptors suck, Oladipo takes too long to come back, Kyrie is cancer again, etc.).
10. **Chicago Bulls**, 31-51. The Bulls lost 60 games last year, so expecting a bigger jump from that is probably expecting a little too much. Regardless, they will be a lot better, with some decent offseason acquisitions as well as a full season of OPJ (who made the team look a lot better after being traded). 
11. **Atlanta Hawks**, 29-53. The Hawks are still in rebuild mode as evidenced by some of their moves (trading for Parsons, for one) and the fact that rookies and young guys will get a lot of minutes. I don't expect them to improve record-wise from last year, but they will nonetheless be fun to watch.
12. **New York Knicks**, 26-56. The New York Power Forwards will be less bad than last year, but still bad. And that's fine. You can't really expect a team giving major minutes to DSJ and Kevin Knox (among other young guys) to make the playoffs. Nonetheless, they will be fun to watch like the Hawks.
13. **Cleveland Cavaliers**, 22-60. One of the true cellar teams of the east who are not going into the season with the idea of winning games. With a Garland/Sexton backcourt, you can't really expect them to win a lot of games, either, but that's fine for now, as they are rebuilding. Maybe the god of #1 picks will be with them again.
14. **Washington Wizards**, 20-62. Also another very bad team. Outside of Beal, who's their 2nd option? Rui Hachimura? The Wizards will lose a lot of games. A lot of games, I tell you. The Wizards will hold out on bringing Wall back since there's really no point this year. 
15. **Charlotte Hornets**, 15-67. The highest PPG last season of anyone currently on the team was 10.1.

#Draft Lottery

As a bonus, I'll simulate the draft lottery using the standings above and the adjusted lottery odds.

The way I did it was by drawing out the lottery odds in the form of a table on Excel and following standard procedures by randomly tiebreaking and splitting the odds. Next, I assigned a range of values to every lottery team based on the adjusted lottery odds for this season, which are seen below. The number of possible values correspond to the number of combinations each team has in the lottery.

1. Charlotte: 1-140
2. Washington: 141-280 
3. Cleveland: 281-420
4. Memphis: 421-545
5. New York: 536-650
6. Minnesota: 651-740
7. Atlanta: 731-815
8. Chicago: 816-875
9. Phoenix: 876-920
10. OKC: 921-950
11. New Orleans: 951-970
12. Detroit: 971-985
13. Sacramento: 986-995
14. San Antonio: 996-1000

Then, I generated four random numbers using an RNG and assigned them to the #1, #2, #3, and #4 picks respectively. Here's the draft order for the outcome I generated.

1. Charlotte
2. Memphis
3. Cleveland
4. Minnesota
5. Washington
6. New York
7. and the rest stays like the pre-lottery order above

Following a quick exit in the playoffs, Anthony Davis (like Dwight Howard before him) will grow tired of the overrated LA lifestyle and leave to go elsewhere. Whether that be Golden State, Philadelphia, or some other rising young contending team. (Again, like Dwight Howard and the Rockets).

Feel free to recall this thread a year from now if I turn out to be wrong but I am strong in my convictions.

Anthony Davis will be an unmitigated disaster for the Los Angeles Lakers.",0.45,controversial,2019-06-20 03:36:20

108,CMV/Unpopular Opinion: Lebron isn't at fault for coaching and GM decisions.,0,8uvyri,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8uvyri/cmvunpopular_opinion_lebron_isnt_at_fault_for/,27,1530329640.0,"I didn't know how to neatly sum up my view in the title, so I'll explain it here more clearly. I have seen a lot of posts and comments involving Lebron, acting like he's a player-coach-GM. The common argument for him being coach is that Ty Lue doesn't do much coaching and Lebron is pretty much the leader of the team and carries the team all the way despite the lack of coaching. The argument for him being a GM is that he campaigned for teammates to get nice contracts and the GMs and owners cave in to that. In short, the basic argument is that Lebron takes over the team when he joins. That's not what I have an issue with; I think this is true. 

But I don't buy this argument: People like to act like they can put the blame on Lebron when he's dealing with bad players on his team because ""well, he campaigned for their contracts,"" or that they can put the blame on Lebron when Ty Lue makes a bad coaching decision because ""well he wanted Blatt fired and vouched for Lue."" 

[When Lebron was with the Miami Heat, he wanted Spoelstra fired.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2611328-miami-heat-minority-owner-claims-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired) Pat Riley stuck by his guy. [Hell, it even sounds like Lebron really wanted Pat Riley to take over as coach](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23088267/pat-riley-said-lebron-james-did-right-thing-left-miami-nba) but Pat Riley stood by his convictions in 2011 and let Coach Spo lead his team to two rings. And Pat Riley talks about being angry when Lebron left, and then he talks about being able to see things from Lebron's point of view and understanding why he made the decision to go back to Cleveland. And hey, Lebron got his revenge by winning a ring in Cleveland after Riley and he reportedly had a heated exchange before they left, AKA Lebron's ""extra motivation."" 

What I'm saying is, coaching is a job. Being a GM is a job. And being a player is a job that is answerable to some degree to their coach and to their GM. We, as employees, all would like to have the guy that we're comfortable with or that we respect be our coach, and we would like to be able to call the shots on how our work operates. If it were up to me, I would go into my job looking for a 4 day work-week of 10 hours rather than a 5 day work week of 8 hours. Unfortunately, I don't have the clout that Lebron James has. 

And I think that being a mature GM and a mature coach is about having that clout. [Brad Stevens, who most agree is already one of the best coaches in the league right now, talked about how he doesn't want to tank](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2018/05/boston_celtics_never_tanked_pe.html). He talked about wanting to be able to have a squad where even if one person goes down, they can build around the rest and still be successful. And he proved that this season by defying expectations even though the two best on his team went down. Why do I bring this up? Because let's say if Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward or Al Horford decided to have the attitude where they walk in and say ""hey I want to fire Brad"" or say ""hey I want this contract for this guy"" and threaten to leave otherwise, Brad Stevens would try to work things out, but in the end, Danny Ainge and Brad would be able to shut the door on the conversation, let the door close on Al Horford without giving in, and not look back. 

At the end of the day, Lebron James is most definitely the best player in this league, and one of the best all time. But that doesn't make him the coach or the GM. Any good teammate is going to stick up for his boys and try to push them to get great deals and great contracts, of course! Any person would stick up for those that they like and go against those they don't like. It's up to the GM to draw the line in the sand when it comes to staffing decisions and contracts, and if that means getting in the face of Lebron James, so be it. When Gilbert supposedly says Lebron leaving would get him his team back, that's not a negative mark on Lebron- that's a negative mark on Dan Gilbert. If Lebron leaves next season and Lue starts drawing up plays and forcing the team to follow that, that's not a negative mark on Lebron, that's a negative mark on Lue for not being able to reel in his players. Phil Jackson did it with MJ and Kobe, and those guys had just as big if not bigger and more aggressive personalities than Lebron.

tl;dr: LeGM and LeCoach jokes are funny, but it's the real GM and real coach's fault if they can't stand up to one of their players, regardless of how good he is. The player shouldn't be getting the blame because the GM or coach doesn't know how to stand their ground.",0.49,controversial,2018-06-29 20:34:00
109,Two overlooked things in the Lebron vs Jordan debate,1,7z6ubc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7z6ubc/two_overlooked_things_in_the_lebron_vs_jordan/,189,1519259578.0,"Tl;dr The fact that Jordan got to team up with an all time great in Scottie isn't considered enough when talking about his Championships, and Jordan didn't have to get through Duncan/Pop and this Warriors dynasty to win his. 

The Ringer is doing ""Jordan Lebron Week"" right now, and I've been reading/listening to all their coverage because as a 26 year old who just missed out on watching Jordan, its something I'm really interested in. In all their coverage however, there are two pro-Lebron points that I feel are missing that I wanted to talk about here and see what you all think.

1st: Scottie Pippen. 
Jordan played with Pippen for 9 years, and Pippen was an elite player for 7 of those. (I'm not counting his first two seasons in the league.) What I think people aren't realizing is just how elite Pippen was. Pippen made the NBA's official ""Top 50 players of all time"" list in 1996, and Bill Simmons ranked him number 24 in 2010. The only players of the same era that Simmons had ranked above Pippen were Barkley, Malone, Olajuwon, and Jordan. In the 93-94 season that Jordan didn't play, Pippen finished 3rd in MVP voting. In other words, its fair to say that Jordan played the majority of his Bulls' career, and won all of his Championships, with another top 5 player in the NBA on his team. Top 10 at worst. 

In Lebron's career, prime Dwyane Wade is the only player he has played with that you could make any argument is a top 5 player in the NBA. Worth noting, Lebron did not team up with Wade until Wade's age 29 season, and by the time Lebron's tenure in Miami ended, Wade was clearly past his prime, which anyone who watched the second Finals against San Antonio can attest to. In other words, Lebron only played with a player near Scottie Pippen's caliber for about 3 years. In those 3 years, he won 2 Championships and lost in the Finals. Can you imagine if Lebron and Wade had teamed up for 7 years of Wade's prime? In other words, if Lebron had been on Miami for the 4 years before he actually joined? Are we sure he wouldn't have 3 or 4 more Championships? I think its quite possible. Lebron was dragging Boobie Gibson to the Finals in that stretch, and Wade was winning a Championship with Shaq. 

2nd point: Who played better teams in the Finals? 
Jordan's Finals were against a 58-24 Lakers team that was 32 year old Magic and not much else, a 57-25 Trail Blazers team that was Clyde Drexler and not much else, a 62-10 Barkley led Suns team, a 64-18 Supersonics team, a 64-18 Jazz team, and a 62-20 Jazz team. 

Lebron has played a 58-24 Duncan/Ginobili/Parker Spurs team, a 57-25 Dirk Mavericks team, a 47-19 young OKC team, 58-24 Spurs team with Duncan and young Kawhi, a 62-10 Spurs team, a 67-15 Warriors team, a 73-9 Warriors team, and a 67-15 Warriors team. 

If you rank the opponents they played, the worst were probably the Mavericks and Thunder that Lebron played. The best were definitely the 3 Warriors teams Lebron played. In the middle, personally, I would put the Duncan led Spurs ahead of anyone Jordan played. Their records are a few games worse than the best teams Jordan played, but Pop always rested guys in the regular season. Duncan is one of the 10 greatest players ever, which none of Jordan's opponents can claim, and Parker/Ginobili/Kawhi and the rest of the supporting cast is very very good. Not to mention Popovich. Its arguable that the 6 Finals Lebron played vs the Spurs and Warriors featured tougher competition than any of the 6 Finals Jordan played in. It is inarguable to me that Lebron's Championship against the 73 win Warriors team, which he did without a Pippen/Wade level player (no offense Kyrie) is the most impressive Championship of them all. (He led every player on both teams in scoring/rebounds/assists/blocks and steals. Insane.) Its arguable that his Championship with Miami against San Antonio is the second most impressive Championship of them all. 

All of this is to say, comparing these two players is really hard. However, pointing to ""Jordan won 6 Championships and never lost in the Finals"" as the end all be all, is stupid. If Lebron had prime Scottie Pippen for every Finals he played in, and he got to play Stockton and Malone instead of Curry/Durant (and the rest of that stupidly loaded team) Lebron may have already surpassed 6 Championships. And he has who knows how many years left? 

Thoughts? 

P.S. If anyone from the Ringer sees this, tell Kevin O'Connor that when a podcast is billed as ""Jordan vs. Lebron"" and Chris Vernon makes an adamant case for Jordan, your role is to make the case for Lebron! Not say ""I didn't watch Jordan so I don't really know man."" Very deflating and not much of a ""Jordan vs Lebron"" debate. Love you though KOC

112,Two things completely overlooked in Game 1.,2,8nu89k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8nu89k/two_things_completely_overlooked_in_game_1/,51,1527906336.0,"I just wanted to bring up two things I haven't seen anyone mention yet from Game 1 and get people thoughts on them.

This first is Tristan Thompson. This is the possession right before he tried to elbow Livingston in the face. 

[Play 1](https://streamable.com/0qq4a)

He attempts to elbow Steph, but has to pull back to avoid colliding with Lebron.  Seems Tristan went for elbows multiple times on back to back possessions but missed both attempts. 

The next play I wanted bring up is the foul call on Klay Thompson with 4.7 left. 

[Play 2](https://streamable.com/s00ve)

On the replay you can see Hill hook Klay's arm, pull it down, then flop to the ground.  This foul call awards Hill two free throws with a chance to tie, and win the game for Cleveland. We all know he missed the second free throw and the JR debacle unfolds. If the refs were pro Golden State, why did they give Hill two free throws to win the game on a flop?

I saw a lot of comments that Tristan should not have been ejected on the Livingston play, and that the officials were one sided in this game. I feel these are two overlooked factors which contradict both statements.",0.51,controversial,2018-06-01 19:25:36
113,(OC)Why is everyone MASSIVELY underrating the Portland TrailBlazers?,0,bocv0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bocv0k/ocwhy_is_everyone_massively_underrating_the/,158,1557829261.0,"In the past 24 hours, i havent seen a team more disrespected than how the Portland Trailblazers have been. It seems like most people on this sub is writing them of and predicting a 5 or 4 game domination by the Warriors. Heres a couple factors that people have been overlooking.

1. **The Warriors are without Kevin Durant** \- KD suffered a calf strain in late game 5 against the Rockets he is out for atleast game 1 and a really high chance he could miss game 2. With KD I agree that the Warriors should be the favorites, but without much info on his injury, its going to be difficult to guess when hes coming back.
2. **Portland is the deeper team** \- So far in these playoffs the Blazers have gotten more quality minutes from their non all star caliber guards than the Warriors have. Their bench has been more than capable of holding their lead throughout these playoffs. Contributions from Rodney Hood, Seth Curry and Zach Collins off the bench have been a big factor to their post season success. I dont see the Warriors getting the same type of contributions from their bench guys. Livingston has declined a lot and its hard to imagine Jerebko going off. 
3. **A much less talented team pushed them to 6 games WITH KD** \- Yes, i know playoffs are about matchups, but there is a large ~~marginal~~  talent gap between the Blazers and Clippers. The Clippers were able to push GS to a game 6 and managed to beat them twice in their home floor. So far the Blazers have 3 road wins these playoffs two of which were against the team with the biggest homecourt advantage and highest win % at home during the regular season (Nuggets). 
4. **Guard Battle** \- Yes the Warriors have the best back court in the league, it just so happens that the Blazers have the second best back court. If there are two other guards capable of going toe to toe with the Splash Bros in scoring it is CJ and Dame Dolla. You could honestly argue that the guards from Portland have had a better post season. Klay has been super streaky on offense, but his defense has been there every game. If the Warriors try to hide Steph and not let him guard Lillard, he will most likely get posted up by Mo Harkless or Aminu just like how they did agaisnt Jamal Murray.
5. **The Blazers are playing with a big chip on their shoulders** \- There isnt another team in the playoffs that is playing with the ""coming at you"" attitude that the Blazers are playing with. 

* Damian Lillard. A player who was been overlooked most of his career until mainly last season, but then ridiculed again for his inability to secure a win against the Pelicans last playoffs. His first round seemed like a coming out party, and his lackluster second round could mean hes in for a big series. 
   * CJ McCullum. A player who has all star level talent, but has not really received much accolades in his career other than a Most Improved Player award a few years ago due to the overpopulation of elite guards in the western conference. CJ was the first player ever drafted from Lehigh University and has earned himself a spot in this league do to his yoyo-like handle and his money mid range shot.
   * Enes Kanter. A player who was named ""UNPLAYABLE"" by an ex coach and was bought out by his previous team. This post season the man has proved that he deserves play time and hes BALLIN. Hes putting up a cool 13pts, 10.5rbs with 51% FG with an eye popping 3.7 Offensive rebounds WITH A SEPARATED SHOULDER and has gone through Ramadan for the past four games.
   * Seth Curry. A player who has been living under his brothers enormous shadow. The kid has contributed some solid minutes this post season and hes looking forward to proving himself against his sibling this series.
   * Rodney Hood. A player who was thought to be out of the league because of his lack of contribution to the Cavs playoff run last year. He has been Portlands best player off the bench all playoffs and has earned the trust of the team by playing quality and important minutes this post season.

**X Factor- Kevin Durant.** Its crazy to think that a team in the western conference finals has a chance of getting back the possible best player in the world and an elite big man. If KD misses more than two games i personally feel like this is Portlands series to lose. A reason as to why i feel like Boogie wont be as big of an impact is him not being 100% healed from his tear. Also Iguodala, the dude has a knack for making game winning plays when it matters the most.

**My Prediction: Blazers in 7.** Was originally going to say 6, but the repeating champs deserve the benefit of the doubt. 

Some of you might just skip this whole post and go straight to the comments claiming im just hating on the Golden State or i dont know what im talking about, but this is my opinion.

3. Lebron-Harden-CP3-Capella is a better Big 4 than the Warriors his best/only shot at beating a healthy GSW next year. 
4. Texas has no state income tax, which would save Lebron millions of dollars annually, especially since Trumps new tax plan punishes those in high tax states. 
5. Houston has the assets/cap space to get him in a CP3 style opt in and trade. RyNo + Tucker and 3 future firsts works perfectly with the cap and for both teams 
6. He'd only committed for one year. If he really, really wants to be in LA he'll be a free agent the following summer and can go there then. But why not win a title first? Lonzo and Ingram will still be there in 2019. 
7. He could finally play with CP3. 
8. Did I mention they'd be unstoppable? The Big 4 + Ariza is a better starting lineup than GSW , and Gordon is better than anybody the Warriors bring off their bench. Bring back Mbah a Moute, NeNe, and some of Lebron's friends on vet mins and they've got the depth.

Bill Simmons is not the ultimate authority on basketball. Bill Simmons also was not around to watch Russell or Chamberlain play. Bill simmons isn't an unbiased subjective observer who should be cited as support in a debate.     

Misconception #1     
""Wilt only dominated because of his size and era""    


Instead of analyzing the size of that era to modern times, I will instead use some other comparisons. Babe Ruth is considered by most baseball journalists to be the greatest baseball player ever. He played from 1918 to 1935 or nearly a century ago. He NEVER played a against  African Americans or latinos. He played against vastly inferior competition and yet his stats are held in high regard and no one questions his ability. I compare him to Chamberlain because they both produced stats that were exponentially higher than the competion. Ruth's numbers were so ridiculous that they have only been approached by Players who were said to be using performance enhancing drugs (Bonds). Yet no one questions the legitimacy of those numbers.    

When people think of wilt chamberlain they imagine some 60s version of shaq who just dunked on everyone. Wilt Chamberlain had a fully developed game. He had a jumpshot,  fadeaway, and shot fingerolls. He was an excellent passer as well as defender. This was in addition to his vastly superior athletic abilities. [Wilt Ultimate offensive force](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCWrGWuU2Ak)

**Misonception # 2**    
""Wilt didn't perform in the playoffs""

[Wilt Playoff Scoring](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/VDWwH   )    
    
For Wilts career he averaged 30.1 ppg in the regular season and 22.5ppg in the playoffs. Some have used this evidence of a drop off in performance during playoff time This just simply isn't true. Wilt chamberlains career has 2 distinct halves. For the first half of his career he was a scoring machine. After this he matured into a player who was a defensive anchor and offensive facilitator. This is evidenced by a DRAMATIC decrease in FG attempted per game as well as the fact that he was a league leader in assists. In his first 4 years in the playoffs he averaged 28.3 FG attempts per game and 34.6 ppg. His next 4 years in the playoffs he averaged 18.2 FG attempts per game and 24.9ppg. Then for the final 5 seasons of his playoff career he averaged 11.4 fg attmepts per game and 15.8 ppg. His playoff number are skewed because the majority of the games were played during his ""facilitator years"". He played  52 playoff games during his ""scoring machine era' where attempted a high number of Fgs per game, and he played 141 GAMES where during his ""facilitator era"" later in his career where he shot a SUBSTANIALLY less number of FGs per game.  
[Wilt Chamerlain Passing abilities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWHKZlQ9x7Q)    
Besides scoring he  posts pretty much the same number in rebounds and other major statistics.    
    
**Misconception #3**

First of all PLAYERS DO NOT WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS, TEAMS DO. Lebron beasted in cleveland but couldn't win until he went to miami. Kevin garnett beasted in Mn but did not win until he to the celtics. Jordan beasted in the 80s but didn't succeed until pippen developed into a top 10 player. Russell had a vastly superior team throughout his career. According to win share Russells teamates were worth 11 more wins per season :[Russell teamates](http://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/?p=4229). Russell had the benefit of playing for Red auerbach who is a top 3 greatest coach of all time while Wilt had a revolving door of coaches in his career. Russell also had the benefit of only being responsible for playing defense, While Wilt's teams relied on him for OFFENSE and DEFENSE.

118,Ranking the TOP 10 NBA SHOOTING GUARDS Entering Next Season.,0,4r6tdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4r6tdn/ranking_the_top_10_nba_shooting_guards_entering/,196,1467660529.0,"My POINT GUARDs list: https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4n2o29/ranking_the_top_10_nba_point_guards_entering_next/

**1) Klay Thompson:** My 3rd choice in the regular season, but his post-season performances just stamped it all for me. Greatest shooter in the game today bar his partner in crime. Takes over games. 2-way beast.

**2) James Harden:** Hate him for his defense, but easily the best shot creator at his position today. Draws fouls easy. Deceptively crazy handles because of his size. Strong as a bull and has wide shoulders to create separation. Can playmake and is a triple-double threat when given the opportunity to run the point.

**3) Jimmy Butler:** Top of my list pre-injury. Didn't come back strong, but a great 2-way player. Is to slashing the way Klay is to shooting. Can run the point too. Egoistic. Better as a 2nd option if on a contender than a 1st.

**4) Dwyane Wade:** Still Top 5 today at 34 being the All-Time great he is. Further proving his solid fundamentals that he relies on more as he ages. Mid-range. 2-way. Clutch as always.

**5) DeMar DeRozan:** Was a toss up between Wade and him in the reg season, but I'm settling for him at 5 because of the contrast in clutch v choke. Elite slasher and mid-range, but a hole on defense. Athleticism on point.

**6) CJ McCollum:** Really came into his own last season. Craziest part about his rise is how unfazed he is and always seems so calm and collected as if he's already a star for years. Stable stroke and reliable in crunch time. Is some sort of a combo guard like how Brandon Roy was for the same team.

**7) J.J. Redick:** Klay-lite or elder-Klay. Is essentially Klay Thompson limited to just running off screens for catch and shoot 3s. Solid defensively. Is the ultimate complimentary piece to the 'Big 3' in LA. Does his role almost to perfection. Very smart at finding angles for separation and a sweet stroke to boot. Crazy efficient at 16 PPG on 48% 3PT FG.

**8) Khris Middleton:** Possibly the most underrated on this list. Low-key the most consistently good player on the underwhelming Bucks (won't say he's the best because of Giannis' out-of-nowhere explosion by season end). 3&D wing. Gives you 20 points if you need him to. Has the size advantage at 6 foot 8.

**9) J.R. Smith:** Big-time in the Finals. Known to be a rapid-fire 3-point chucker, but when tamed in an environment with stars around him, came into his own as a 'pick your poison' weapon. Sweet shooting stroke allows him to get a solid shot off off-balanced when his team needs it. Turns up his defense when called upon. Willing sacrifice of his ego en route to a long-awaited ring.

**10) Avery Bradley:** All-Defense level defense. Hounds the on-ball player like no other. Improved his 3-point shooting to become a respectable 3&D threat. Absence in the playoffs obviously cost Boston a well-matched series. Still, an undersized player at SG.

**Honorable mentions:**

**Brandon Knight & Victor Oladipo:** One played at an All-Star level pre-early-injury and the other may finally break out in the OKC-Harden role on a contender.

119,Why is it a prevalent opinion that Fultz will rediscover his jump shot in the off-season when he's worked on his jumper behind closed doors for 5 months and has shown marginal improvement at best?,0,8e67xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8e67xl/why_is_it_a_prevalent_opinion_that_fultz_will/,142,1524460020.0,"Here's Sixers' beat writer Kyle Neubeck answering a question on whether Fultz will improve his jump shot over the offseason: 

>I’m really not trying to be alarmist about Fultz’s future, but I don’t think the complete absence of his jumpshot is lending the most hope toward the reclamation of his shot.

>As I reported in February, the public timeline and the private timeline for what Fultz was doing this season are wildly different. This is not a player who was shut down and not working for an extended period of time — Fultz was in the gym working and shooting all throughout the season, including during the tumultuous months of October and November.

> Knowing that’s the case, the case for him rediscovering his jumper in the offseason becomes flimsier. It’s one thing to minimize expectations for skill development within a season because it’s hard to ask players to keep piling on new moves and traits when you’re trying to build a base of consistency. But Fultz is not having a normal season, and was allowed to essentially go through a skill development program without any of the day-to-day demands of playing in games.

> Is that much different from what he's going to be exposed to this offseason? I'm not sure. You can make a case that coaches and trainers he might work with would have unlimited time together in the offseason, free from the burden of helping with game prep and development of other players. They can get back to basics with Fultz without limitations. He's a hard worker and a good kid, and those facts still bode well.

> Theoretically, yes, a full offseason will help him more than anything he was able to do during the season. There's a low likelihood he'll play in Summer League, as I'd imagine the team will be happy to have him working out behind closed doors and just getting thousands of reps in as a jump-shooter.

> But as with anything Fultz-related, there's too much guesswork to say for sure. I don't know if or when the ""old form"" is coming back, and I would be skeptical about anyone who postures as such.

Moreover, Westbrook is leading a lower-caliber team (relative to the Warriors) to the longest win streak in the NBA, a claim Curry cannot attest to. 

Since the beginning of January, comparative statistics:
       
**Russell Westbrook:** 12G, 34.4MPG, 27.9/9.2/9.9 on .506/.407/.671        
**Stephen Curry:** 11G, 34.8MPG, 30.9/5.2/6.8 on .528/.480/.863             
_______________
Obviously, Curry has the offensive advantage, as evidenced by the disparity in PPG and 3PT%. However, Westbrook has spearheaded the remarkable Thunder turnaround. He's a significantly greater passing and assisting force- he doesn't have a player like Green to facilitate the offense- and does more work on rebounds as well. 

The obvious reason Westbrook should be receiving MVP consideration is his durability. Curry and Harden, whom most consider the frontrunning candidates, have missed significant time. This damaged their team. Westbrook has been the pinnacle of durability, playing in every Thunder game this season.

I'll start by saying this is a personal opinion and that it doesn't encompass the impression of the entire /r/NBA community on the matter. (Though you would see in the comments below if they agree or disagree.)

Straight to the point: I'm not sure whose idea is this, Adidas or NBA's but, uhm, this paraphernalia is as fatuous as excreta.

The Boston Celtics is a legendary championship franchise but seeing Evan Turner with the gold tab was just wrong. The Sacramento Kings have the tab for the championship they inherited from the Rochester Royals. And it's crazy to think that the Celtics, the team that has the most championships with 17, have the same gold tab as the Kings, a team that has one from the 50's. If my count is right, there are 17 current franchises that have won a chip. I guess I better get used to it.

Or not.

*Here's what I suggest:*

* **Have the gold tabs for the defending champions only.** I mean, it's fair, they deserve it, the champs deserve something.
* **Have the gold tabs for players who have a ring.** Of course, benchwarmers will have them but hey if you were part of that team, you deserve it. I don't mind seeing Joel Anthony with it while Carmelo Anthony doesn't vs. seeing Boozer with it while LeBron without.

He had a devastating injury and the Heat had a horrible year.  He backed it up with 30 pts 7.5 assist, 5 rebounds 2 steals and a block per game the next year, all from a 6'4 guard.  He held Miami down with absolutely no help after their first championship.  Then Lebron and Dwyane and Chris hookup.

Now everyone on r/NBA and even real life are complaining, ""wade holds Miami back"" ""Lebron would be so much better without Wade"" Frankly, they went to 2 finals in 2 years.

Lavar Ball has had a reason to keep his mouth shut, doesn't want to mess up a good thing Lonzo has going by being on the Lakers with LeBron, can't imagine what Lavar would do when he has no incentive to stay quiet. 

Brandon Ingram: After next season Brandon Ingram is eligible for a max and if the Pelicans don't offer him a max, another team most certainly will based off of the fact Andrew Wiggins and Otto Porter got one. So the narrative goes from Brandon Ingram being a nice young controllable asset to probably being over paid and just, meh.

Kyle Kuzma: Not much to say here, he is a great asset and is probably the actually highlight of the trade.

The reported two first round picks: the first round picks would have been  in the 24-30 range, meh.

In conclusion, the Lakers offer was anything but a kings ransom. I think it was best for the Pelicans to wait until the off-season when they have a new front office to make the decision. It is VERY hard to imagine that the Lakers won't still be offering Brandon Ingram and company.

In the regular season, dude is 5th in BPM all-time (behind LeBron, MJ, Charles Barkley, and David Robinson) and 11th in VORP (just behind Larry Bird). 

For Win Shares, he's sporting a casual .247 career ws/48, which is 4th all-time behind MJ, David Robinson, and Wilt. LeBron is 6th. He comes in at 19th all-time in Win Shares, just behind Kobe Bryant.

RPM is seen as the best statistic for evaluating players, but only goes back to the 13-14 season.

I haven't watched all of these guys and a lot of these judgments are based on stats alone, so please tell me if I got something wrong.

I put some guys here where it may be too early to call them a bust, so they could very well redeem their careers in the future. Conversely, it may be possible for some guys to make themselves seem more like busts over time.

#2018 NBA draft (1)

* No. 13: Jerome Robinson (barely played this year, stats not so good)

Draft is looking pretty stacked so far. Too early for anyone besides JRob to stick out as a potential bust, but of course, he can turn it around, it's only his first year.

#2017 NBA draft (2)

* No. 1: Markelle Fultz
* No. 8: Frank Ntilikina

Good lottery, things could change but so far only these two PGs stick out as busts. Fultz isn't bad, but relative to what you expect for a No. 1 pick, he kinda is. Frank is just bad, but he's young and can turn it around.

#2016 NBA draft (4)

* No. 4: Dragan Bender
* No. 8: Marquese Chriss (could turn it around, putting up good numbers after trade to Cavs)
* No. 10: Thon Maker
* No. 13: Georgios Papagiannis (not even in the league anymore...)

Weak draft, some solid players later in there but lottery isn't so hot. 

#2015 NBA draft (4)

* No. 5: Mario Hezonja
* No. 8: Stanley Johnson
* No. 9: Frank Kaminsky (if you're reading this, sorry)
* No. 14: Cameron Payne

Several solid rotation players in this draft. Jahlil Okafor would be here if I made the list a few months ago, but he's redeemed himself after his burst of really good play for New Orleans. If it's not sustainable, back here he'll go.

#2014 NBA draft (5)

* No. 1: Andrew Wiggins (wouldn't be considered a bust 2 years ago, but now, yeah)
* No. 2: Jabari Parker (injuries...)
* No. 5: Dante Exum
* No. 8: Nik Stauskas
* No. 9: Noah Vonleh

Stacked draft in terms of busts. Wiggins was looking good until he got his max contract. He promised to improve, but I don't think he can capitalize on that. Jabari ""They Don't Pay Me to Play Defense"" Parker is also looking more and more like a bust. Some solid players later in the draft.

#2013 NBA draft (5)

* No. 1: Anthony Bennett
* No. 4: Cody Zeller
* No. 5: Alex Len
* No. 7: Ben McLemore
* No. 14: Shabazz Muhammad

Pretty bad draft, with several high busts. Best player in the draft wasn't even a lottery selection.

#2012 NBA draft (3)

* No. 2: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
* No. 5: Thomas Robinson
* No. 13: Kendall Marshall

Decent draft. Not too many busts, and some stars.

#2011 NBA draft (4)

* No. 2: Derrick Williams
* No. 6: Jan Vesely
* No. 7: Bismack Biyombo
* No. 10: Jimmer Fredette

Deep draft, but weak at the top (except for Kyrie).

#2010 NBA draft (5)

* No. 2: Evan Turner
* No. 4: Wesley Johnson
* No. 6: Epke Udoh
* No. 11: Cole Aldrich
* No. 12: Xavier Henry

Pretty mediocre draft. Most of the talent is at the top, and the top still has a good amount of busts mixed in.

#2009 NBA draft (6)

* No. 2: Hasheem Thabeet
* No. 6: Jonny Flynn
* No. 8: Jordan Hill
* No. 11: Terrence Williams
* No. 13: Tyler Hansbrough
* No. 14: Earl Clark

Stacked both in terms of superstar talent (Blake, Harden, Curry, DeMar) but lots of busts. Some solid players later in the draft.

#Conclusion

Interesting to note that Charlotte drafted (or traded for, on draft night) 5 busts in a row (2011-2015).

138,Why dont people ever mention how much easier it was for Jordan to score because of old defensive rules?,0,6co7h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6co7h1/why_dont_people_ever_mention_how_much_easier_it/,38,1495498477.0,"If you want to compare Lebron and Jordan then compare the rules too.

There are two illegal defense rules. The old one prohibited zone defense. The new one limits the ability of a zone defender to remain in the paint guarding no one.

For decades the NBA required teams to play man-to-man defense, which meant everyone on the court had to guard someone. You could double team one player and then recover to your man, but you could not be caught between players, guarding no one. That would be an illegal defense. That also meant you couldn't just stand in the paint all day guarding no one.

To take advantage of this rule, lousy teams with one great player like Michael Jordan would put MJ on one side of the floor and everyone else on the other side. This was the isolation play, or iso, for short. It would turn into a game of one-on-one which MJ would win. (This is before Jordan found some worthy teammates and Phil Jackson incorporated them into the offense with the triangle.)

Various tweaks to the rules tried to limit isos, but never eliminated them. When zone defenses became legal, though, it made isos much harder. The two man game, the pick and roll or pick and pop, has become much more popular than isos, simply because the defense can easily flood the side of the floor where the iso is taking place, forcing the star player to go one on three or pass the ball.

The NBA tried to give something to iso players when it eliminate the old illegal defense rule and made the zone legal. In order to prevent rim protectors from standing in the paint all day, when the NBA eliminated one kind of illegal defense they created another, the 3 second rule. A defender cannot stand in the paint guarding no one for 3 seconds or longer. Every 2.9 seconds he has to step out of the paint. That's the modern illegal defense rule.

However, despite the new illegal defense rule, legalizing the zone defense led to Tim Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, popularized when Thibodeau was the assistant coach in charge of defense during the Celtics' championship season in 2007-08. The zone had been legal for a while, but Thibodeau figured out how to flood the strong side of the floor, the side with the ball, with an extra defender, often forcing a long cross-court pass that would allow time for the defense to recover. The object of the defense was to force the ball out of the best player's hands.

Thibodeau dealt with the new illegal defense rule by training Kevin Garnett (and later Joakim Noah) to remain in the paint for 2.9 seconds, step out, then step back in. As long as he steps out every 2.9 seconds, he could be in the paint all day, guarding no one.

Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, or variations thereof, have been widely adopted in the NBA. The iso has fallen out of favor. The two man game is very popular, but passing to the other side of the floor must remain an option if the two men on the strong side find themselves outnumbered. One of LeBron James' remarkable abilities, for example, is making bullet passes all the way across the floor with precision to a spot up shooter standing at the three point line, so that the defense doesn't have time to recover. This is a vital skill under present rules. 

In addition to this you couldnt double a player without the ball. It was much easier for Jordan to score with 90s rules than it would be with current ones.",0.49,controversial,2017-05-22 17:14:37

143,[OC] Are Chris Paul and Big Sean the same person?,8,8q2b8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8q2b8t/oc_are_chris_paul_and_big_sean_the_same_person/,25,1528680334.0,"Hello /r/nba, I posted this before but now offseason is in full swing and this comparison still hasn't been compromised by the WCF. I have come to the startling realization that the NBA's very own Point God may possibly be the rapper Big Sean. In this post, I will prove to you that Big Sean and Chris Paul are the same people through three different categories: Physical Traits, Timeline and Legacy.

**Physical Traits**

Take a look: [Big Sean with a hat](https://i.imgur.com/tIHBExe.jpg) looks a lot like [Chris Paul with a hat](https://i.imgur.com/CUtcAPO.jpg). Similar facial hair, similar eyebrows, similar mouth, and both wearing hats. 

Furthermore, Chris Paul is an undersized point guard (""6'0"") with great court vision, smooth handles, and an underrated finishing ability. Big Sean, similarly, is an undersized rapper (5'8'') with a [great vision](https://youtu.be/D-OJud1suYA?t=1m27s), [smooth handles](https://i.imgur.com/rJ9oL41.jpg), and an [underrated finishing ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUVS0qhow7g). Those are not the most intriguing coincidental physical traits. 

Big Sean got his moniker because he has a self-proclaimed large dick (Google for a maybe photoshopped image). Chris Paul, likewise, [is a huge dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfKEBENB7tk).

If these physical similarities are not enough, consider this: both Big Sean and Chris Paul have never been seen together. Ever. Even though both lived in the same part of Los Angeles.

**Timeline**

If we take a look at both CP3 and Big Sean's timeline, we can see more similarities. First, let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, Chris Paul (33) is 3 years older than Big Sean (30), but you have to account for inflation and basketball age. Chris Paul is 6'0 officially. However, he is closer to 5'10 without basketball shoes, almost 3 inches less than his listed height. If he were to take off his basketball shoes, his age would scale accordingly and take 3 years off.

The most compelling evidence in their timelines is the release of the song [Bounce Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phr1pOFK1V8). In this song, Big Sean proclaims ""Last night I took an L but tonight I bounce back."" Released mid-2017, ever since the song gained traction that summer, Chris Paul has [never lost back-to-back games in Houston](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01/gamelog/2018/) when he played EXCEPT one time. The only time he lost 2 games in a row was in Detroit, or Big Sean's hometown. Every other game he played, he bounced back after taking the L.

Big Sean's album releases also coincide with events in Chris Paul's life. His first studio album, ""Finally Famous"", was released in 2011. This year was also when Chris Paul signed to the Clippers, where he moved to LA where people become famous. 

Big Sean's second album, ""Hall of Fame"", was released in 2013, around the time when people realized that CP3 had a likely chance to go in the Hall of Fame as one of the best point guards. This was around the time that CP3 got his first MVP award (All-Star Game) and led the Clippers to a franchise-high 56 wins at the time. Through this album, Sean released his hit single [Guap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ6y5nIW26E). Similarly, Paul signed a 5 year $107 million contract with the Clippers.

""Dark Sky Paradise"", Sean's third album released in 2013, parallel's Paul's discontention with the Clippers. With song names like All Your Fault, I Don't Fuck With You, Play No Games, Win Some, Lose Some, and Stay Down, Sean chronicles Chris Paul's failures to go past the second round in the NBA Playoffs.

CP3, after years of mediocrity in the playoffs, got fed up and signed with Houston to create a contending team. Fittingly, Big Sean released his album ""I Decided."" in 2017 around the time of the signing, clearly parallelling LeBron's The Decision but for Chris Paul. This album has the hit song [Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cIkC7s3d2o), of which Chris Paul has [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ler0hq_lYfM).

**Legacy**

Both Chris Paul and Big Sean are stars in the NBA and hip-hop communities, respectively. Chris Paul is widely regarded as one of the best point guards in the league currently, but has never been the consensus best. Big Sean is one of the top selling rappers in the game, but will never reach the level of Kanye, Kendrick, Jay-Z etc. Both men have name recognition but not a lot of facial recognition to casual consumers.

I deem both Chris Paul and Big Sean with the Modelo Legacy.

What is the Modelo Legacy, you ask?

Well, Modelo, as some know, is a beer. It's a decent beer. Most Americans have heard of it and many people have had it before. If someone asks you, ""All I got is a Modelo, you want it?"", most people would say sure. It is entirely socially acceptable to enjoy a nice Modelo, but if someone says that it is their favorite beer, something is wrong. No one should have Modelo as their favorite beer. They can enjoy one, but at the end of the day, Corona is a better AB InBev beer that tastes better.

Similarly, Big Sean is a good rapper. He makes hits. People play him at parties and enjoy his songs, singing along to his catchy hits. People understand him as a popular rapper and no one bats an eye if you say you like Big Sean. But once someone says that Big Sean is their FAVORITE rapper, you know something's wrong. There are many answers to the question, ""who is your favorite rapper,"" but Big Sean is not one. You can list any rapper (Biggie, Danny Brown, Elzhi, Ghostface, Future, Chance, Kendrick, Uzi Vert, Famous Dex, Yung Lean) and you can usually argue why you like them the best. There are no arguments why Big Sean is someone's favorite rapper. Hell, even the hometown treatment doesn't work because Eminem and Slaughterhouse is from Detroit.

In CP3's case, he is a great player. People call him the Point God because he is very good at what he does. He plays defense, he passes the ball, and he scores. Fans like Chris Paul. It's fine to do so. It's respectable. But at this moment, he shouldn't be anyone's favorite player. He's not the best point guard in the league anymore (or at any time shoutout to Deron Williams fans). He isn't even the best guard on his own team. Houston fans usually like Harden or Capela more. Pelicans fans like AD, Boogie, or Jrue. Clippers fans now like DJ, Lou, or Boban.

However, both Sean and Paul will have a legacy in the hip-hop and NBA communities. Big Sean is one of the best selling artists of the current generation and has headlined many festivals. He has had multiple albums reach number 1 in the Billboard charts and has multiple triple platinum songs. Chris Paul will still be remembered as one of the greatest point guards ever in the NBA. He is a 9-time All-Star, 7-time All-NBA, and 9-time All-Defense player destined to enter the Hall of Fame.

**Conclusion**

So what do you think? Are Chris Paul and Big Sean the same person?

TL;DR: Paul and Sean big same.",0.53,controversial,2018-06-10 18:25:34
144,[OC] Joel Embiid is (not) a Turnover Machine,0,858nz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/858nz3/oc_joel_embiid_is_not_a_turnover_machine/,34,1521369829.0,"I've seen a bunch of posts on this subreddit talking about Embiid and one of the biggest criticisms of his game: turnovers. The general narrative seems to be that Embiid is a young player who turns the ball over a lot, and is therefore one of the driving forces behind the 76ers leading the league in turnovers.  

I'd like to argue the opposite. **I believe Embiid helps the 76ers prevent turnovers more than any other player on the team** and I'll try to show why.  

First, let's take a look at the best and worst teams in the league with turnovers (full data [here](https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/?sort=TOV&dir=-1)):

|Rank|Team|Turnovers Per Game|
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|1|Mavericks|12.4
|2|Timberwolves|12.4
|...|...|...
|28|Warriors|15.7
|29|Lakers|15.9
|30|76ers|17.0
The 76ers are the worst team in the league at taking care of the ball. There are a number of reasons why this might be, ranging from inexperience to starting a rookie point guard with shooting struggles, but I'd argue the single biggest reason is their *style of play*. They play an offensive system with a fast pace, lots of ball movement, and lots of player movement. [This recent Nylon Calculus piece by Ian Levy](https://fansided.com/2018/03/07/nylon-calculus-offensive-style-changes-2017-18-season/) does a great job visualizing these offensive styles in a clear way, and when we look at teams like the [Mavericks](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Mavs.jpg) and [Timberwolves](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Timberwolves.jpg) (who rarely turn it over) versus the [Warriors](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Warriors.jpg) and [76ers](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/76ers.jpg) (who turn it over a ton), it's easy to see the difference. I'm not going to argue that one style of offense is inherently better than another, but I think it's reasonable to say the Warriors/76ers style causes more turnovers at a team level than a slow offense with fewer moving parts.

---
Now let's imagine dropping a player into this high-turnover system. How would you measure whether they were turnover prone themselves as opposed to being a victim of the system?  
I'd propose looking at how much the 76ers turn it over when that player is on the floor versus when they are off. To do this, we'll use team turnover percent (TOV%) instead of turnovers per game, and among those with at least 100 minutes played this season, here is the data (full data [here](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612755/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1)):  

|Player|Minutes Played|76ers TOV% On Court (Rank)|76ers TOV% Off Court (Rank)
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|Ilyasova|198|14.3% (1/14)|14.1% (1/14)
|Embiid|1782|15.7% (2/14)|17.9% (14/14)
|Luwawu-Cabarrot|807|16.2% (3/14)|16.9% (12/14)
|Anderson|387|16.3% (4/14)|16.8% (9/14)
|Belinelli|362|16.3% (5/14)|15.3% (2/14)
|Redick|1776|16.5% (6/14)|17.0% (13/14)
|Covington|2119|16.5% (7/14)|16.9% (11/14)
|Saric|2046|16.6% (8/14)|16.8% (10/14)
|Booker|494|16.7% (9/14)|16.5% (6/14)
|Simmons|2316|16.8% (10/14)|16.5% (7/14)
|Holmes|522|17.3% (11/14)|16.6% (8/14)
|McConnell|1491|17.4% (12/14)|16.2% (4/14)
|Bayless|925|17.4% (13/14)|16.4% (5/14)
|Johnson|927|18.5% (14/14)|16.0% (3/14)
|Overall|3284|16.7%|16.7%
Embiid's numbers stand out. Other than Ilyasova, who recently joined the team during a time when turnovers have been down overall, the team turns it over the least when Embiid is on the floor and the most when he is off. This is not at all what we would expect if Embiid was the reason behind the turnovers. It actually looks much more like a stabilizing player inserted into a turnover-prone system.  
There is an alternative hypothesis why Embiid's on/off are so staggering. Maybe his backup is the real issue, dragging everyone else's TOV% up except for Embiid's. This is (rightly) a common critique of on/off data, and while this might seem plausible looking at Amir Johnson's numbers, it seems doubtful. Johnson is actually having a [career low](https://stats.nba.com/player/101161/?sort=PCT_TOV&dir=-1) in the % of his team's turnovers attributed to him, and his on/off data using team TOV% [with](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) [Boston](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) and [with](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) [Toronto](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2013-14&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) placed him either among his team's best or middle of the pack. Johnson simply looks bad because he never gets to benefit from sharing the floor with Embiid, unlike Richaun Holmes, the other backup center who often sees minutes at power forward alongside Joel.

---
**TL;DR**: Of course Embiid makes bad decisions with the ball, forces passes at times, and could do a better job handling double teams.

I realized recently that it's actually Kareem who has the best claim to GOAT from anyone else.  He dominated the entire decade of the 1970s, then was a top tier Center for the entire 80s.  Elite player for an entire two decades.

**Kareem:  6 MVPs, 15 All NBA Selections, 11 All Defensive Teams, 6 Rings, Career PER 24.5**

**MJ: 5 MVPs,  11 All NBA Selections, 9 All Defensive Teams, DPOY, 6 Rings, Career PER 27.9**

**Bron: 4 MVPs, 15 All NBA Selections, 6 All Defensive Teams, 3 Rings, Career PER 27.1**

Kareem had more MVPs, more defensive teams, longer prime and extended his career as a supplementary star in the late 80s.  The only reason his PER took a major tank is because of the sheer longevity of his career- his 13-year prime's PER average is around 27 as well.  

Kareem has the longevity, has scored the most ever, has the most MVPs indicative of prime (if you look at individual years, he should've had a total of 10 MVPs (the entirety of the 1970s except for 1975), while Jordan should've had 9 MVPs (1988-1993, 1996-1998), and Bron should've had 8 MVPs (2008-2013, 2017-2018)).

148,My case for Lebron James deserving his 5th MVP,2,5uo17e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5uo17e/my_case_for_lebron_james_deserving_his_5th_mvp/,65,1487387712.0,"First of all, I'm a Lebron die hard fan. He is why I started watching basketball back in 2006 and he's why I'm ferociously obsessed with it today. So, if my bias is sticking way out, I apologize. But here's my case for Lebron deserving the MVP this season. 

As of today,
Harden on-court: +7.6
Harden off: +4.6
Westbrook on-court:+3.2
Westbrook off: -10.5
Lebron on-court: +9.1
Lebron off: -4.2
So, what does that mean? It means that Hardens team does well without him and I attribute that to the crazy tempo and system the Rockets play in. Westbrooks total net rating here is +13.7 where Lebrons is +13.3, so Westbrook is having a greater positive impact on his team overall by 2/5 of a point over Lebron. A marginal difference which I'm going to call a tie. 
Lebron/Westbrook: 1
Harden: 0

Harden and Westbrook have had healthy teams all year. I know they both have rosters with less talent than Cleveland, but that can't be ignored. Lebrons been down a starting guard for months and will continue to be, as well as being down another starting all star forward for the rest of the regular season almost. Hes doing more with less in my opinion because of the uncertainty from game to game. This whole section is my bias sticking way out but hey, whatever. 
Lebron:2
Brodie:1
Beard:0

Hardens team is a top 4 seed in the west, but they've been struggling recently. Brodies team is the 7 seed I believe, but they're just not a very good team in general. Lebrons team is the 1 seed in the east and are 7-1 in their last 8. 1 seed > 4-7 seeds. Therefore,
Lebron:3
Brodie:1
Beard:0

All 3 guys are averaging career highs in assists, so that's a wash. Harden is leading the league in assists though, so he gets the point here. 
Brodie is averaging a triple double. holy fuck. he gets a point too. Lebrons shooting 39% from 3 this year, his second highest ever, and a higher number than KD can claim. For Lebron, that's a storyline in itself. No point for that, but it's noteworthy considering that was a worry going into the playoffs last year. 
Lebron:3
Brodie:2
Beard:1

Now it's about the narrative. Brodie has the KD departure/revenge tour on his side along with the triple doubles. But, he's a turnover machine (not entirely his fault, but still) and he's super inefficient offensively and average defensively. And, his team isn't going to finish top 4. How far will the narrative carry him? I don't know. 
Beard is on a fun and dope team to watch, they let 3s fly, and don't play defense at all. He's still a bad defensive player, but he has the astronomical numbers and change to point guard thing going for him. How far will his numbers go to persuade people? I don't know. 
Lebrons interesting. He has the ""here's your reward for what you did last June"" thing in his favor, he has an injury depleted team for the remainder of the season which will only spotlight his play even more, and he's having his best season ever if you exclude his 4 MVP years. He's the universally accepted best player in the world, leading his team to the 1 seed in his conference, averaging 26, 9, and 8 on 54% from the field and 39% from 3. I give this one to Lebron. 
Bron:4
Brodie:2
Beard:1 
Also, I didn't include Kawhi because he hasn't been getting the buzz at all so I just assumed it would be kinda impossible for him to jump all the way into the conversation and I didn't include KD or Steph because they cancel each other out, in my opinion. 

Anyway, there's my biased take on why Lebron deserves the MVP. If I missed anything narratively for these guys or if I'm forgetting an important stat or something, let me know. I'll update this thing if I need to.",0.51,controversial,2017-02-17 19:15:12

The thing is though compared to Giannis, Kawhi, Steph, LeBron, Jokic even, he doesn't make his team better. 

All of those guys create shots for themselves or create shots for their teammates. 

The man hasn't won a MVP, DPOY, not has been in actual consideration for those awards he's not even top 20 in both offensive & defensive per 48min win shares.

If you go for total win shares he's 13th behind Capela, Gobert, & Vuecic 

Hell the man quit on his team to take a easy way out, he doesn't even want to play the 5 because he doesn't want to get too injured, yet if you want to win you do whatever it takes.

Imo he's overrated, Giannis who came into the league a year later has the same amount of all nba selections, was in consideration for DPOY, & already won a MVP in less time than AD.

I don't buy the shitty roster statement that AD has been excused with, Jrue is a all-star caliber guy, Boogie before he went down is a top 10 center, Rondo while old played well for the Pelicans, yes Moore & Crawford weren't all that great but Giannis had to work with Joel Bolmboy, John Henson, DeAndre Liggins. 

Yes he had Parker & Brogdon but AD did have Holiday & Cousins, it's not like **the Pelicans didn't try to give him talent** hell **Alvin Gentry is a DAMN better coach than both Jason Kidd & Joe Prunty**

Like if you keep on saying ""so & so's roster was garbage"" you might as well excuse Karl Anthony Towns if he underachieves this year & leaves, or Devin Booker, guys who have so much talent, are considered top talents but everyone is saying they'll leave sooner than later because their organizations apparently missed the mark. Fact is that the teams can only do so much, the Wolves got **Jimmy Butler** which is a good move that didn't work out LIKE the Boogie trade. 

The Sun's just got Ayton who is a **BEAST** & now have a possible good PG in Jalen Lecque while getting Rubio in the meantime to help his development/start for them.

**TL;DR:**  Truly top 5 players elevate their teams & you can only blame a roster for so long, especially when there's evidence that the organization has tried to bring in talent to help their star + lack of consideration of alocades, it comes down to that specific player not having that talent to elevate their teams like Kawhi, LeBron, KD, Harden, Curry, Giannis & even Jokic. That's why I think AD is not as good as people make him sound like.**",0.57,controversial,2019-08-17 20:48:26
151,Addressing homophobia in and around the NBA,0,auswuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/auswuo/addressing_homophobia_in_and_around_the_nba/,145,1551171543.0,"Firstly I’d like to state I’m not making a controversial post for attention nor mean to make wild accusations of homophobia, as there are much more relevant examples in the world. I am making this post because I care as much about LGBT issues as the NBA. 

Also, don’t take this as an attack on why you enjoy the NBA or that enjoying certain characteristics of players makes you a bad person. I am simply using LGBT activism as a lens to be critical of the culture surrounding the NBA. 

My post uses incidents of homophobia in and around the NBA and the response to make an argument rather than data. I would also like to admit my argument here isn’t irrefutable and there are likely holes in my reasoning. 

With that said, let’s talk about Dwight. 

Now, immediately I want to separate jokes made about the allegations and actual homophobia. I’m talking about people calling Dwight a f*g or that he’s traded frequently because he’s a predator in the locker room. I know what you’re thinking: “That’s just how some toxic fans think and not representative of everyone” and I agree, to an extent. In the late 1960s the Celtics asked the city what could improve attendance. A lot (don’t know the exact percent, citation needed) of responses were “get rid of the black players”. Although those Celtics fans were only some of the fans of the NBA I think it accurately shows how a fanbase can be problematic without it necessarily being the majority.

With that said here’s my question: Why is there a homophobic culture in the NBA when social
activism is a big aspect of the league. 

Well, my response requires a suspension of disbelief in the sense that I don’t have concrete metrics on how to measure bigotry and what causes it. In order to answer the question, I need to define who is a fan of the NBA. 

Well, fans of basketball, who presumably played / are playing organized basketball.
 (I know this is obvious but it’s going somewhere). Since these fans wanted / want to be like their idols, there must be qualities of NBA players that they emulate. I propose the most revered aspect of an NBA player is their background, more specifically if they went from “Rags to Riches”. People like this quality because they think it’ll make them a better player because of the characteristics we attach to these players. That they work harder than the rest, that they deserve respect for making it out of their challenging situation, etc. However, I believe that another aspect of these players that fans idolize is their masculinity, as “a man does what it take to succeed in life”. 

Hopefully it’s clear where I’m going with this now. That the reason NBA fans are generally contradictory in their beliefs about social activism is because being gay isn’t seen as a masculine. 

(I don’t believe this is true but hopefully my argument makes sense now). 

NBA fans respect players because their masculinity allows them to work harder than the rest and become one of the best basketball players in the world. Therefore, (some) NBA fans don’t respect non masculine players / players they don’t think are masculine. For example, Dwight Howard being seen as gay, and in turn disrespected. 

I think this mentality isn’t exclusive to fans but also players.

 For instance, Jokic’s “No Homo” comment which, although it wasn’t homophobic, demonstrates a disdain for what’s perceived as non masculine. If that example doesn’t convince you, maybe Tim Hardaway Sr. stating he hates gay people in regards to former NBA player John Amaechi coming out as gay. 

Summary: 
Now, I’m not saying it’s impossible to go from rags to riches and not hate gays. I’m also not saying all NBA players go from rags to riches or that all NBA players believe masculinity causes greatness. I’m simply making an argument on why homophobia exists in the NBA (and I guess also in other sports) when it seems hypocritical.

Tl;dr - players and fans think masculinity is vital to being a good player which leads them to have homophobic ideas",0.47,controversial,2019-02-26 00:59:03

You could say that Ingram doesn't have to share touches with Kemba/Brown/Hayward, but they actually attempt almost identical shots per game (18.6 for Ingram vs 18.0 for Tatum). 

Ingram just scores 4 points more per game because he's way more efficient. 60% TS% for Ingram vs 52.5% for Tatum. That's actually harder to do when you're the offense's primary option as opposed to the defense having to focus on Kemba, Brown, Hayward, etc. as well.

The Rockets don't really have a plan B. Live and die by the 3 and even though Harden has somehow gotten even better, he's still clearly susceptible to shooting meltdowns in playoff games. I've been super impressed with Daniel House but Houston's D just doesn't seem the same. 

The Bucks on the other hand are terrifying. They've been shooting superbly, Giannis with 58% (?) TS was the lowest of any of their starters in the first round. They can play through Giannis but at the same time have some excellent shooters. D looks solid and there's a swagger about the team, all while Malcolm Brogdon who's arguably their 4th/5th best player is missing.

*Even when they praise him for winning*, they find a way to qualify it or undermine it or make backhanded remarks denigrating him. 

They ""like"" him but the **respect** isn't there. 

Quick tangent: my aunt is the black sheep of the family. She married a douche at 18, dropped out of college, accrued a lot of debt and generally made a lot of dumb mistakes. In her 40s-50s she turned things around (graduated, got a good job, etc.); but she's still the designated cautionary tale of our clan. Everyone will say ""it's great she accomplished X, Y & Z, but just think of how much better off she'd be if she'd done it 20yrs ago"" or ""if she'd been smarter with money"" etc. etc. 

KD reminds me of this women, doomed to forever be perceived/portrayed as a weak willed screw-up, and used as a cautionary tale for young players. 

**Just consider:**

* KD goes to the Warriors he's called weak. 
* He wins two chips they say he's riding coattails. 
* He's injured and can't play, they say the dubs swept the Blazers, proving they didn't need him. 
* The dubs start to lose, they say he's checked out on his teammates cause he plans to leave anyway.
* Dubs go down 3-1, they say he's weak and hiding cause he doesn't want to risk returning and losing 
* He returns, plays well and suffers the worst injury an NBA player can suffer, they say he's great for trying to play...***but it was just another sign that he is susceptible to peer pressure/public influence.***

 He has often been compared to Lebron or Curry and found lacking (in maturity, as a leader, as a man). The latest narrative is how the strong and stoic Kawhi (who doesn't give a fuck what anyone thinks) wisely chose not to play. Whereas KD was worried about public opinion, media coverage and peer perception, so he fucked himself over by choosing to play too early. This narrative has been dispersed by friends and media alike.

Yes, Kawhi had his turn being dragged last year...but he is being lauded now *because he won*. Winning solved ***nothing*** for KD as far as the media was concerned.

After he won back to back chips, the praise was qualified with talk of asterisks or ""look at his team"" or ""he needs to leave if he wants to prove himself.""   


KD brought a lot of this on himself. But the media seems to ***delight*** in inserting smirking, derisive references to his alt accounts and sensitivity *whenever possible*.

163,De'Andre Hunter and Cam Reddish are victims of a star player unwilling to sacrifice his numbers for the long term development of his team and a coach without the guts to do anything about it.,29,ecazcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ecazcu/deandre_hunter_and_cam_reddish_are_victims_of_a/,129,1576694479.0,"First of all, we need to kill the narrative that Trae Young has no help. Anyone who watches Hawks games knows how ridiculous their system is, not to mention this roster was constructed to make Trae get the most numbers possible while they are developing their rookies. Problem, he's not helping his rookies at all. The guy dribbles for 20 seconds and forces his rookies to shoot with 3 seconds left on most of his possessions to them. Both Hunter and Reddish are basically spot-up shooters on this team.

How many times have we actually seen Hunter make a single highlight play that resembles what we saw at Virginia when he consistently got the ball? I know we like to call Reddish the worst player in the league but he's clearly improved month to month and is currently shooting 35% from 3 in the month of December primarily due to the few explosive games he had when he actually got the ball consistently.

Trae needs to sacrifice handling the ball and occasionally play off-ball. In fact, having your best 3 point shooter play off ball actually would take a lot of pressure from the rookies as we've seen how shooters like Steph and Harden draw players away from their teammates. What do y'all think?

164,Amin Elhassan is exaggerating how good the Golden St. Warriors' defensive was this season (particularly as compared to the Atlanta Hawks).,0,4j3ydu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4j3ydu/amin_elhassan_is_exaggerating_how_good_the_golden/,67,1463130806.0,"It baffles me that many within the basketball world -- most recently Amin Elhassan on The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz today (05/12/2016: http://espn.go.com/espnradio/show?showId=danlebatard) -- continue to discount what the Cavs have done so far in the 2016 Playoffs. Near the end of the podcast, Amin went off about how much better Golden St.'s defensive is compared to either team the Cavs have faced so far in the Eastern Conference Playoffs (Detroit or Atlanta). He pointed out that points allowed per game isn't a good measure of how good/bad a team's defense is (TRUE) and that things like points allowed per 100 possessions is a better/more accurate measure of a team's defensive prowess (also TRUE). Using that (sound) logic, however, he went on to imply that the Warriors defense this season has been significantly better than anything the Cavs have seen thus far in the Playoffs. But is that true?

* Defensive Rating (DRtg) for teams is points allowed per 100 possessions. The Warriors allowed 103.8 points per 100 possessions, good for #6 in the NBA; the Hawks, by comparison, allowed 101.4 points per 100 possessions, good for #2 in the NBA (second only to the Spurs historic defense).
* Another helpful team defensive metric is opponents Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), which adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal. Golden St.'s eFG% allowed was 47.9%, good for #2; the Hawks' eFG% allowed was 48%, tied for #3.
* Defensive Rebounding Percentage (DRB%) is also a helpful defensive metric because it estimates the percentage of available defensive rebounds a team grabs. The Warriors grabbed 76% of available defensive rebounds; the Hawks grabbed 74.6% of available defensive rebounds.
* A final metric is the ratio of free throw per field goal attempt (FT/FGA - the lower the better). Golden St. ranked #17 at .208; the Hawks ranked #4 at .198.

More specifically to the question of a possible Warriors vs. Cavs Finals, many have wondered whether or not the Cavs can keep up their historic 3pnt shooting (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cavs-3-point-barrage-in-game-2-was-ridiculous/ | http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2016/05/11/analytics-art-cavaliers-sizzle-from-3-point-range-in-2016-playoffs/ | http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_active_p.html | https://hoopshabit.com/2016/05/08/cleveland-cavaliers-3-point-shooting-sustainable/). Consider:

* The Warriors ranked #2 by allowing opponents to shoot 33.2% from beyond the arc; the Hawks ranked #6 at 33.8%.
* Golden St. ranked #13 in 3's allowed (1,927 = 23.5 3's allowed per game or 26.3% of opponent FGA); Atlanta ranked #16 (2,008 = 24.4 3's allowed per game or 28.4% of FGA).
* Golden St. allowed opponents to shoot 35.8% on corner 3's (representing 18.3% of opponent 3PA); the Hawks allowed opponents to shoot 37.6% on corner 3's (representing 25.3% of opponent 3PA).
* 77.3% of 3PM versus Golden St. were assisted; 84.1% of 3PM versus Atlanta were assisted. 

None of this means that the Cavs will average ~19 3PM per game against the Warriors (or the Raptors, Heat, Thunder, or Spurs). None of this means that the Cavs will continue to shoot better from beyond the 3P line than inside of it. (It may suggest that the Cavs corner 3P and/or assisted 3PM will decline a bit.) What this DOES MEAN, however, is that Amin Elhassan's assertion that the Warriors defensive this season was substantially better than any defense the Cavs have seen in the Playoffs this season is demonstrably false. At best, the Hawks and Warriors were comparable defensive teams during the regular season; at worst, the Hawks may have been a bit better (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hawks-have-a-better-shot-at-stopping-the-cavs-this-time/).

So, while it is true that the Cavs are more likely to regress to their regular season shooting numbers (35% of their FGA were from 3P, where they shot 36.3% (on 2,427 3PA)) than continue their current blistering pace (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2016/05/09/cavs-offense-can-carry-them-to-finals-even-if-historic-three-point-shooting-cools/ | http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15494567/nba-playoffs-2016-cleveland-cavaliers-continue-hitting-3-pointers | ), the regular season numbers suggest that it won't be because Golden St. is far superior than Atlanta at defending the 3.

You mentioned kind of the chess match. Is that the team you were talking about -- how Atlanta tried different ways to defend them?

So far, there hasn't been a chess match. They've been too good. It was one thing against us, but I watched that Atlanta series with great interest. Atlanta was the second-best defensive team in the league, and I'm thinking, ""This'll be great, to watch how they defend Cleveland."" And they didn't even have as good luck as we did.

They tried everything -- Kent Bazemore on LeBron, Paul Millsap on him, starting Thabo Sefolosha, all kinds of switching.

You have two guys like LeBron and Kyrie Irving who can take you off the dribble, [Love is] maybe the best inside-outside big guy in the league, and then everyone is shooting at that level -- I don't know what your options even are. I didn't have an answer. I'm anxious to watch the next two rounds and see if someone else does something that works better.

But they've played at an extremely high level, and if they are going to shoot the ball like this, they have as good a chance to win the championship as anybody, East or West.

Now, I don't know they can go four series shooting like that.

I don't see how it's possible.

When they did it against Atlanta's defense, I guess I really took notice. We were a slightly above-average defensive team, but when you look at what Atlanta was able to build defensively and saw what Cleveland did to them -- wow.",0.49,controversial,2016-05-13 02:13:26

What was done to solve this? Lose their best floor spacer and their closer. Nothing done to add complementary prices to the bench. 

Tobías is better suited at the 4, but Hortford will now assume that role, though it is not his natural role. Josh Richardson is nowhere near the shooter JJ was. Josh also has a tendency to slash more than JJ and while his metrics show he was more effective spotting up, his volume in that area is a much smaller sample compared to JJ. 

The bench was not upgraded - depth was an issue last year as well, but at least they had four all-stars. 

The 76ers smallest player will be 6’6” (Josh) and 6’9” on average - a huge lineup. I know Al is very quick for his size, and so is Ben, but the direction the league is tending makes me doubt that the 76ers will be as elite on Defense as the media has implied. 

The team did not get better on the break. Josh will push with Ben, but the rest of their players are not big time floor runners, neither is anyone off of their bench. 

The slowed pace will likely be most effective against Indiana or Orlando, who already play slow - I do not think they can withstand the Bucks even with Al on Giannis. The Nets will push pace, the Celts will push, the Heat will push. 

All this assumes Ben and Joel stay healthy. There is an insurance policy for Joel in Al, and an okay filler for Ben in Josh. 

Ben needs to develop a shot. Embid needs to stay healthy and show up when it counts, even then I don’t see them as better than last year. 4th seed IMO and a second round exit. 

Tl:Dr - Floor spacing, closing, and bench not addressed in free agency

But the Bucks Hornets PGT just summed up this subs hive mind for mine. Hornets are like what 15-31 with a mediocre coach and a mediocre roster. But last night we played the best game of our season by far. JB’s coaching was spot on for once, going small vs Giannis with surprising efficacy, and with PJ guarding Giannis super well on drives. Malik Monk dropped 31/5/5 with ELITE defence. Tae showed his craftiness and still hit some shots. 


Like rewatch that game man. Giannis literally grabbed offensive boards over those guys to bail out bricks from some of these Bucks guys to get them the win. Late game Malik was still getting clutch buckets vs Donte without any screen to create separation, just straight up ISOs because our coach played him offball basically most of the game(which again is so idiotic, he turns it over but his vision is insane. Look at this kinda pass: https://twitter.com/richierandall/status/1220831983762399233?s=21).


Now let’s look at the Hornets Bucks PGT top comments: 

- “Giannis in the 4th: aight well I guess we should win the game and shit” (527 upvotes at time of voting: verbal fellatio but completely fair because without him they don’t win this one. 
- “40-6 sounds so much more substantial than 39-6. Them bucks is good “ (262 upvotes at time of writing): again completely fair. Monumental achievement by a GREAT team
- “Yes folks Batum really is that bad.. 1/8 shooting for 5pts in 34 minutes in your only regular season game ever in your home country.” (109 upvotes “ “)again completely founded
- “Phil Jackson said if you reach 40 wins before 20 losses you are a contender. But these guys reached 40 wins before 10 losses. It's absolutely unreal” (289 upvotes “ “) ok sure another one about 40 wins, again fair.
- “40 wins before 20 losses. We a real contender” (172 upvotes “ “) ok again fair, reference to Phil’s quote. But surely those comments stop there...
- “i have the feeling the bucks kept the game close for us poor french but then decided to win late in the fourth” (51 upvotes) no talk about our strategic doubling, our small ball lineups, our strong halfcourt O spearheaded by our future backcourt Tae and Malik, or PJ’s strong ISO defence on Giannis and our aggressive help off bad shooters like Donte and Bledsoe. The worst so far, but excusable. 
- “40-6 and still need to win 9 more just to get on pace for 73-9.i sometimes forget how ridiculous that streak was.” (126 upvotes “ “) ok now it’s getting repetitive.
- “That was a pretty solid, competitive game until the Bucks woke up and completely took over during the final six minutes” (84 upvotes “ “)ok I’ll take this but I don’t think the Bucks “woke up” I think Giannis kept dominating the glass which saved this team from an embarrassing loss to a team that’s 15-31
- “Donte DiVincenzo is a future all star” (113 upvotes);  ok I’ll accept it because he’s super underrated by non Bucks fans but he did get cooked by Malik consistently in one on one situations...just saying. And his ballhandling and PnR skills aren’t quite all star level yet although he could reach there. He’s got great court vision, and he’ll be all defence one day. Very good player. 
- “The consistency in which the bucks play this year is amazing.....at home or on the road, good team bad team doesn't matter, imo that's the biggest reason why Giannis is MVP handily it's a direct reflection of his leadership and the way he plays on both sides of the ball” (34 upvotes): wouldn’t say this is a great win. Hornets showed that Bucks still struggle with Bledsoe spotting up and shooting, Hornets showed Bucks defence is prone to giving up wide open 3s since we had so many practice shots. Hornets showed going small not a death sentence vs Bucks and hence Boston and Stevens probably would be watching this tape and  using it for their own defenders. Maybe they use Ojeleye or Brown in the PJ on Giannis, objected with stating in front of Giannis, while elite help defenders like Tatum and Williams come over and help.
- “It was close for two and half quarters, I'll take it
- “Also MONKKKKKK. He better get more fucking consistent playing time now. The second best guard (arguably best tbh) on the roster behind Graham. This isn't meant to be Rozier slander btw, it's just he is not a good point guard at all, he's a good catch and shoot player” (57 upvotes): shoutout my fucking guy u/buzzbuzz01 for being a hornets fan and somehow getting more than 10 upvotes on a comment in this thread.
- “Robin Lopez is a thot. He's a freaking nasty hoe. His hair is so good. I'd love Robin to beat my ass like a mascot and tell me all about the benefits of looking homeless. If a 7 foot tall Sideshow Bob shows up with comic books and his twin brother he can fuck me up any fucking time of day dude. If a guy's like 'I come off the bench but I'll make you feel things you've never felt before' i'm like 'slam a basketball in my ass like its the Slam Dunk contest my dude'.” (67 upvotes): ok one of these is fine I guess. Unnecessary given he didn’t really do anything in game; he’s a cult hero but save it for when he does something.


Finally after trawling through all these comments, I find this nice one from a guy with a Greece flair u/de_grecia:


- “Good game by the Hornets. Gave it all. Wasn't enough though. The Bucks might indeed go all the way”
How many upvotes? A whopping 12.

Now, let’s go to the YouTube video for Bucks Hornets highlights here: https://youtu.be/vhcHamiNh1g

- “Man Charlotte came to play” ( 9 likes)
- “Fantastic play by the hornets but Giannis is unreal” (35 likes): completely true and simple summation of the game. Bucks are contenders for a reason but hornets played the best game they’ve played this season.
- “ what an effort by the hornets “ (11 likes)


Finally this one which I’ll link in a comment below because I don’t have an imgur account and where I’m from it’s 5.30 AM and I can’t sleep.

Chicago's Michael Jordan, the NBA's leading scorer, claims the Detroit Pistons deliberately tried to hurt him. 

""There was no doubt in my mind that Mahorn, and later Dantley, was trying to hurt me,"" the angry Jordan said. 

Meanwhile, Dantley and teammate Isiah Thomas thought that the Bulls, especially Jordan and Collins, overreacted.

""Every top player is going to take his lumps and get knocked to the floor, and I think Jordan has to learn that"", Dantley said. 

""Do you mean you can never touch a guy? When I led the league in scoring, I used to get banged up every night, sometimes harder than Jordan was.""

Yes, other fan bases have done it. Yes, they were lost in a moment of extreme excitement and tribalism. That doesn't excuse it. It doesn't make them bad people, but anyone who reacted with joy over news of KD's injury should be embarrassed and should take a moment to ponder what it says about their priorities and basic humanity.

However, the continued focus of this board upon this topic seems odd given the the far more significant news of KD's injury. One of the top 2-3 players in the game may have been irrevocably injured and it may have been entirely avoidable. Most people were eager to see him play, 

We could be considering:

1. whether KD pressured the FO to let him play
2. whether the FO should have taken his preference into consideration (cause players will always want to play) 
3. whether the FO or the media actually pressured KD to play

And, ultimately, how much responsibility GS bears for playing a recovering player hard to avoid elimination.

Personally, I would prefer to have Paul run my team, but that is personal preference and as much as I love Curry, I have a weird feeling the NBA will suddenly see 6'3-6'5 versions of Chris Paul instead of more Steph Curry's, and that just sounds more exciting to me than a bunch of point guards who play like their MyPlayers.

_____

**1) Passing**

+ Chris Paul may finish his career as a 19-10 guy, which would be historical and unprecedented. I don't think Curry will ever reach that, but he could see his assist numbers rise if he wanted. However, that assist:TO is absurd. Paul is giving his team between 8-12 points for every one time he costs them a possession. I'm about to make a stat up, but that's at least 8ppm (points per mistake). Curry's is still good for an NBA point guard, but Paul's is transcendent.
+ Sheer numbers wise, Chris Paul just runs an offense in a very traditional way. He is every coach's dream. Put it this way: if a 5'8-6'0 freshman walked into basketball tryouts in high school and played the way Paul does, he would get sent straight to varsity and possibly even see loads of court time. Nothing is better than a point guard who can pass, shoot, defend, and not turn the ball over. Curry would take time to win the coaches ever, much like he has taken time to win fans over, and that's not a knock on him; it's just the way the game goes. It's changing now, but at every level, Paul's passing and decision making when passing is a tier above the rest of the NBA, and it has been for the past six or seven years.
+ Curry makes much flashier passes than Chris Paul, wows the crowd more, and actually has the ability to make certain passes that Paul can't because teams attempt to deter Curry from the three point line with more reckless abandon than dog owners deter their dogs from chocolate cake. However, Curry's flair for that signature behind the back pass leads to a few turnovers and embarrassing out of bounds bounces. Paul makes the right pass and gets flashy with lobs and threading the needle. It's subtle, not as flashy, but more effective in game and in getting Paul assists. This is personal preference, but I'd rather have a guy hit my players in their shooting pockets 9/10 times than a flashy behind the back pass that they have to adjust for. But until Curry starts hitting his players in rhythm with those flashy passes among other passing nuances...
+ Advantage: **Chris Paul**

________

**2) Shooting**

+ The absolute number one thing that stands out: Curry is a much better shooter. Given that we widely regard Chris Paul as an elite shooter, to have Curry extend even beyond that is mindboggling. Chris Paul is a better career midrange shooter: career ~47% between 3 and 16 feet. Compared to Curry: ~42.5% between 3 and 16 feet. However, Curry is getting better and better, with his average this year around 47% as well. 
+ eFG% measures the efficiency of shooting, and Curry blows Paul away in that regard. 
+ Steph Curry's off the dribble shooting, quick release, and uncanny ability to score threes off 7+ dribbles almost as efficiently as the rest of the league does *uncontested* (don't know where I saw this stat, Nylon Calculus I believe) makes him the greatest shooter of all time on pure skill and versatility. He also does have the two best seasons ever when it comes to made threes. Oh and the most in the playoffs. By 42. 
+ Huge advantage: **Steph Curry**

________

**3) Scoring**

+ They are both equally as skilled around the basket when it comes to finish. Paul absorbs contact better (or at least more consistently) and is craftier with those bank shots (sorry, San Antonio), whereas Curry has all kinds of spins, floaters, scoops and rainbows that make him the fucking Baskin Robbins of finishing around the rim.
+ True shooting wise, which measures the efficiency of scoring, Curry is just slightly ahead of Paul, probably due in part to his more accurate three point shooting. 
+ They each have their signature moves: Curry with the firecracker, electrify the crowd, this-is-straight-of-a-streetballer's-wet-dream pull up three; Paul with the, ""I don't care if I'm 6'0 and 180lbs, fuck you I'm Chris Paul"" off-the-dribble elbow jumper. Both are effective, though off-the-dribble three point shooting is just statistically more likely to go cold for longer stretches. But when Curry is hot, his signature move is unstoppable and significantly more demoralizing than Paul's, though the Spurs might have something to say about that.
+ Honestly, they score in different ways, and while Curry is more prone to go for 50 than CP3, Paul can take over at any given point and can often times subtly score 30 through a collection of tough midrange jays and timely threes. When Curry's going off, you know he's going off. With Paul it's subtle. Plus his scoring is good enough where you have to choose whether you want him to hang 40 on you or hang 15 assists on you. With Curry, 40 spells almost certain doom. This one comes down to preference.
+ Advantage: **wash**

________

**4) Handles**

+ Well, there isn't exactly a concrete way or statistical way to measure this. But Paul's found himself on the other end of Curry highlights a couple too many times. The way I like to think of it is that Curry has the ball on a string and does what he pleases with his dribble moves, weaving, awing, and just flat out dominating. Paul's hands are a prison and the ball is trapped within it. He does less, but at times he's much safer about his dribbling.
+ Paul can protect the ball and control it at the transcendent level required for a top point guard of all-time, which leads to less turnovers. Curry could easily control the ball more, but his game is much more predicated on the dazzle of it all. Curry's a magician. Sleight of hand. The turn. The prestige. But make no mistake, there is substance to his style, and if he can further refine when (to dazzle) and how (to use it most efficiently), this won't even be a discussion anymore. As it is...
+ Slight advantage: **Curry**

__________

**5) Defense**

+ Holy shit. Just holy shit. Paul's defense, both effort, skill, lateral quickness, ability to play passing lanes, pickpocketing skills... he has it all. While he has lost a bit and is not as quick as he was before his knee injury, Paul can still defend every point guard in the league admirably, even if it means getting crossed up every now and again. Plus a career DRTG of 104 is very, very impressive. 
+ Curry used to be a bad defender, letting defenders cut by him, letting himself take plays off, but he quickly improved his help defense and is a solid presence on the court. He plays passing lanes well and gets a good jump on the ball. Paul is just a little bit better in that aspect. And a lot better in others. Plus he has that eye test intangible of absolute abandon and tenacity on D.
+ Huge advantage: **Paul**

_________

**6) Versatility**

+ Curry is not the one trick pony we know him to be, that's for sure. He can lead a team and create in many ways. Plus he has that undeniable gravity to his game. He could be 0-21 but you would never dare leave him open, lest you find yourself looking worse than Sheed in '05. He sees the defense well and passes it well, whether it be to Splash Bro Klay or the Bogue-ster (just made that up, sorry). The Warriors were an elite offensive team this year, and Curry was the lead star. Is that Kerr/Gentry's scheme or is it Curry? Probably both. But he ran it beautifully and played to his strengths.
+ 123 ORTG? What. CP3 has regularly led an elite offensive in the Clippers every year he's been there and was the driving force behind a potent attack in NOLA as well. He commands a team and runs whatever scheme fits the other players best. He also plays to his strengths, which happen to be all of them. Stick Paul into any offense and they'd be improved. Even Golden State. Not by much, but by a little.
+ Curry would also improve many offenses. He just has to be the focus. On a team like the Clippers or the Cavs, he would be able to score and command the offense, but cohesion with any player, in almost any system, is lacking. This comes down to somewhat of a preference- rook or slightly nerfed queen? Curry explodes when in the right situation; Paul can do it all, as a queen moves all over the chess border, though he can't quite go all the way as a rook does (say the queen had a 5 space max in every direction). Also yes, that was a double entendre. But this question is about versatility after all.
+ Slight advantage: **Paul**

_________

**7) The Next Level**

+ Back to the versatility thing; Chris Paul may be running a top level offense every year, but consistency is nothing if you never peak.
+ Curry is peaking, and hey, Paul did in 08 and 09, averaging 11.6 and 11 assists respectively, along with 17.8 and 18.3 win-shares, but Curry peaked on a top 10 team of all-time. He won 67 games and went 16-5 in the playoffs against three 53+ win teams and the other four members of the All-NBA 1st Team. 
+ He averaged 28.3 points in the playoffs, and probably would have averaged 30 if he hadn't turned in a dud of a Game 2 in the Finals. 
+ Curry has an MVP, and while Paul definitely deserved one in 2008, he is soaring. We expect the same consistency out of Paul next season, but we can definitely see Curry taking it up even another notch. And that's too scary to ignore.
+ Advantage: **Curry**

__________

**8) Fuck You Factor**

+ Before the Finals, I had this all on CP3. I mean, that scowl on his face and that intense look he gets when he's priming to go off? That's got a big ""fuck you"" written all over it. Plus the Hammy game. That's an all-time great performance. And many more instances where he realized that his bench was terrible and that he had knee problems, not back ones. He just took over, and I wish he did it more, but it's definitely there and it's definitely scary.
+ But then Curry did something so savage. In a span of four minutes in Game 5, he turned Matthew Dellavedova from unsung hero into the recipient of the biggest stink face since Brandon Knight. Dear God. I don't really like Steph Curry because of what he did to Georgetown and I like to hold 7 year grudges but man, he said ""Fuck you Delly, fuck you r/NBA, and fuck you too Michael Jordan."" That's impressive. 
+ Still, Paul has a history of it, and for me, plays like the DJ-shoot-the-fucking-ball and the Dwight-tackle, have that factor in spades. But... Curry did it in the Finals. In a must-win Game 5. In the face of his fuckboy defender. On a shot I don't think I've even seen in a 2K montage. Steph could have shat in my backyard the very same day and that shot still would have been fire. And his attitude is getting there too.
+ Slight advantage: **Curry**

___________

**9) Meaning to His City/Cities and the Game**

+ In NOLA, Chris Paul was in the DWade/Lebron/Duncan/Kobe/Nash/Dirk tier, but when he landed in LAC, he became the second fiddle in what will always be Kobe's city. Still, he is beloved in LAC and they wouldn't trade him for anything except maybe Lebron and Kyrie together. He brought basketball to OKC, he and Drew Brees were the unbroken levies in a broken city rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurrican Katrina, and he has played with heart and passion for years. That 61 point game in honor of his grandpa's 61 years of life... incredible. 
+ Today, after bringing a historic season to the Bay Area and winning MVP, I'm pretty sure (to quote Bill Simmons) they'd trade the Golden Gate Bridge before Steph Curry. He is beloved by the media, by the fans, and comes from a family that the NBA wants to be their classier version of the Kardashians. Just wait till Seth makes the NBA again and has a kid marginally less adorable than Riley. 
+ Curry's the hero; Paul's the villain. It's what makes this debate so fun. But, it has been said that you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. And that's what happened to CP3. But the thing about the NBA is that you don't become a villain by just being around for a long time; you have to be *good* for that long. 
+ Slight advantage: **Paul**

Efficiency wise if a player is a huge plus on offense it makes sense to have them expend the majority of their energy getting points instead of making high energy cost/low return defensive plays. Especially when that player is by far the most effective offensive player on the team. 

Lebrons famous 48 minute playoff games utilize this strategy and Harden is the highest usage player in league history so it’s less about defensive skill as opposed to a strategic decision. 

This is why Harden prefers to guard bigs in the post where his style is more about stealing low rather than jumping to block. And when looking at his defensive efficiency in the post it’s up there with the best in the league.

Defense isn’t necessarily about the flashy blocks of a Giannis or the scrappy pestering of a Pat Beverly. It’s about not letting the other team score the ball and Harden does a good not great job at that. I rest my case.",0.48,controversial,2019-09-02 23:21:52

&#x200B;

 Jalen not in bold

I spoke to Rose on Wednesday, before Game 3 of the Finals, which he was covering from Oakland. I had been interested in talking about his basketball and media career, but I started by asking him about the analytics movement, which has revolutionized most major sports, and Rose and I spent most of our conversation discussing it. During the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed the racial dynamics that he sees underlying various sports debates, the good and the bad of the so-called “player-empowerment era,” and whether he was kidding when he recently went on television and [cast doubt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_ce4QGqiNw) on the moon landing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It seems to me that a lot of ex-players don’t like the increasing focus on analytics and advanced stats in the conversation around sports. Do you think that is fair as a generalization, and if so, why do you think that is?**

&#x200B;

Oh, wow, you are going to start off with a don’t-get-fired topic that I am going to pull you behind the curtain on, if you really want to know the impetus behind the backlash.

&#x200B;

**I’m all ears.**

&#x200B;

No. 1, there are many people that feel like it has a cultural overtone to it that basically suggests that, even though I may not have played and you did, I am smarter than you, and I know some things that you don’t know, and the numbers support me, not you. Two, you notice that, when it is a powerful job in sports—whether it is an owner, whether it is a president, whether it is a general manager, whether it is a coach—usually in football and basketball, sports that are primarily dominated by black Americans, it’s also an opportunity to funnel jobs to people by saying that, “I am smarter than you because the numbers back up what I say, and I am more read. I study more. I am able to take these numbers and manipulate my point.” It’s almost like when you hear that a player doesn’t have experience at doing X job. People that normally get the jobs you are describing don’t, either. They didn’t play at most levels, but that suffices as their “experience” and validates their opportunity for power.

&#x200B;

**Just to be clear, when you say “cultural overtones,” you mean racial overtones?**

&#x200B;

Correct. And one other point I want to make with that: it is laughable to me when playing experience gets equated to any other type of experience, including coaching. When you play—for example, somebody like me, who has been playing my entire life—for some strange reason that experience gets diminished when it’s time to talk about powerful positions in sports—like, He doesn’t have experience. There is no bigger experience than being in the foxhole, in the huddles, and out on the floor—being a part of the game plan and being game-planned against. But also all the people you learn from: your teammates, the coaches, how to navigate with the media, how to navigate with the fans. Instead of it being, He doesn’t have experience, it really should be, He has more experience than almost anybody walking the earth.

&#x200B;

**When you say “manipulate,” do you think that analytics people are doing something dishonest for their own ends, or do you just think they don’t have the experience? “Manipulate” is a loaded word.**

&#x200B;

I am saying it becomes an entry point, a validation.

&#x200B;

And let me say this: I give myself a forehead slap like the Three Stooges when I hear players and ex-players say that somebody can’t cover the game that didn’t actually play the game. That is also extremely incorrect. Just because you played the game, that doesn’t mean that you are best at analyzing the game, or coaching the game, or working in the front office. It’s the totality of the individual that allows special people to be able to juggle and be successful at both.

&#x200B;

**For many years, political reporters would go out to some diner in Pennsylvania, and they were really experienced at travelling and meeting people and reporting their opinions. More recently, statistics experts and polling experts came in—like Nate Silver, who works at your company—and they basically said that, rather than going to diners, we can learn a lot about the American electorate and voting patterns by analyzing data in a complex way. Even though a lot of these people have no experience reporting, they have incredible insight into the American electorate. I wonder if you think that is a fair comparison.**

&#x200B;

I think what you say does make sense. I appreciate the example. It’s a great one. However, numbers can be manipulated. Look no further than our current election and how it played out. If you were paying attention to all the polls, we would not have thought that the result would end up being \[what it was\], if you are going only by the numbers. Numbers can be manipulated. Statistics for me are things you can count: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals. Analytics are things that you quantify: player-efficiency rating (P.E.R.), usage, net whatever. I think analytics should be a tool in the box, not the actual toolbox.

&#x200B;

**Right, but everything except points, such as rebounds, assists, blocks, steals—all these things are ways of analyzing the goal of the game, which is scoring more points than your opponent. So even if it is a more complex formula like P.E.R., it’s still the same thing. It’s just a more complex and accurate version of what people have been doing forever, which is looking at box scores.**

&#x200B;

The stats that I just described, for example, for me, they physically take place. I can physically watch a game and see them. By the way, I am not a big stats guy. I am an impact person.

&#x200B;

**Meaning?**

&#x200B;

I know just because you had five steals doesn’t mean you are a great defensive player.

&#x200B;

Since the Warriors did not have enough players, I allowed them to keep Speights and Barbosa. Minimal Impact from both.

**[Game 1:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065546&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** The Warriors come off to a bad start against the Chicago Bulls but thanks to the rallying of Curry and Durant, the Warriors lead a comeback to win Game 1. If you look towards the bottom, player of the game goes to Steph.

Interesting Box Score Stats:
Luc Longely scored 19 points and grabbed 7 boards.
Rodman had 19 boards.

**Warriors lead 1-0**






**[Game 2:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065560&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** The Warriors overall had a good game but were led by Klay, Curry and Durant with help from Draymonds rebounding. Michael Jordan did all he could to keep the Bulls in the game, but strong performances in the second and third quarter helped the Warriors stay in the game. 

Player of the game: Steph

Interesting Box Score Facts:
Jordan took 36 shots.
Rodman again had 23 boards showcasing his elite rebounding.
The Warriors and the Bulls both shot badly from three.
The Bulls showcased more ball movement as they has 7 extra assists.

**Warriors lead 2-0**






**[Game 3:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065561&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** The Warriors were no match for Scottie Pippen and MJ as they were demolished by 16 points, perhaps by getting out rebounded constantly. Scottie nearly had a triple double as Rodman once again out rebounded Jesus. 

Player of the game: Scottie Pippen

Interesting Box Score Facts:
The Warriors were out rebounded by 22 boards.
Michael Jordan set a defensive tone with 5 steals.

**Warriors lead 2-1**






**[Game 4:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065562&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** The Warriors rally back thanks to a huge game by Steph who had 31 points. Although Jordan tried his best to rally his team back, Pippen just couldn't handle the ball properly and lost it multiple times.

Player of the game: Curry

Interesting Box Score Facts:
Curry had a very efficient , high scoring game but still managed to get 8 assists , most likely because of his all star lineup.
Pippen had 6 turnovers.
Ron Harper and Steve Kerr were effective off the bench getting 20 points and 15 points each respectively.

**Warriors lead 3-1**






**[Game 5:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065563&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** Michael Jordan just would not let his team go down as he managed to score 35 points with a near triple double. Pippen's scoring also helped keep the Warriors in check. Durant did all he could to keep the Warriors in the game but alas the Jordan led Bulls win Game 5.

Player of the game: Michael Jordan

Interesting Box Score Facts: 
The Bulls had 21 fouls counted on them while the Warriors only had 8.

**[Game 6:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065564&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** For the first time all series long, the Warriors finally out rebound the Bulls, led by Draymond, Durant, Curry and Klay they manage to fend off Michael Jordan and his 30 points and win the NBA finals. Toni Kukoc also had a great game off the bench and Rodman did not go a game where he was out rebounded by any other player.

Player of the game: Steph Curry
Finals MVP: Stephen Curry

**Warriors win 4-2**

Interesting Box Score Facts: 
No player this whole series cracked 40 points which shows how amazing Lebrons performance was and not one got a triple double although some were very close which just goes to show how difficult Timmy D's nearly quad double performance was. 
Steph redeemed himself and Durant was basically the number two option again.

182,Why Raw PPG is significantly overrated and the importance of efficiency,0,3uyr9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3uyr9x/why_raw_ppg_is_significantly_overrated_and_the/,73,1448978486.0,"Warning: Long post but I think it can help alot of people understand why we tend to overrate Volume scoring and underrate efficiency.



Among various discussions on nba reddit, I'm surprised to see how many people don't understand the incredible importance of efficiency. Some definitely get it, but others clearly don't understand. 


There is also a significant overrating of raw scoring, while it is definitely valuable, on it's own without taking into context the efficiency of the scoring it is easy to overrate how valuable it is. 


This is primarily in response to comments in a specific thread regarding a question about 00-01 Lakers vs current warriors where a comment was made that the Lakers had two players then (Shaq and Kobe) better than any player on the warriors (Curry).
Then a discussion ensued where comments were made that essentially curry's efficiency is very overrated/irrelevant. 


Now this isn't to spark some thread about Kobe vs Curry, blah blah etc., so please if you're a huge Kobe or Shaq fan don't take this as a shot at them because it completely isn't. I love kobe/shaq. This is to help highlight just how incredibly important efficiency is, and I'm using this an example since it was recently relevant to a discussion. 


Basketball is a team sport, what's ultimately important is how much a player is helping their TEAM score as many points on the team's number of possessions per game. Then of course on the flip side how much a person helps their team stop the opposing team from scoring on their number of possessions per game. 


It doesn't matter how impressive the scoring ""looks"" from a viewer standpoint or how much effort or willpower it takes that player to score those points. What matters is how it's ultimately impacting the team. 


First, the ""amount"" of points a player scores, on it's own isn't valuable. There are a finite amount of possessions a team has in a game. If a star player is injured or leaves a team, the shot attempts he took don't just disappear. 


What IS valuable is: 

1. How much more efficiently that player scores on his shot attempts compared to how efficiently the team could score those shot attempts without him. 

2. How much more efficiently that player helps his teammates score 
 

Now I'm going to break down the difference in value of Shaq and Kobe's regular season numbers in 2000-2001 compared to Curry's right now. (Now while I find it unlikely he maintains this rate of scoring and efficiency, the discussion was related to how curry is playing currently). 


In the 2000-2001 season: 
Shaq averaged 28.7 points on a TS% of 57.4  

Kobe averaged 28.5 points on a TS% of 55.2

Not including tonight's game since it isn't updated yet on Bballreference:
 
Curry is averaging 31.9 points on a TS% of 69.1
 
Now as I mentioned previously, when a player is gone those shot attempts don't disappear and the offense adapts.  
Now, even if you removed one of these players from let's say the 0-18 sixers, a team that is intentionally tanking, that offense is still going to find a way to convert those shots at a TS% of 50.2(sixers current TS%). So the actual ""Real"" value of the player's scoring is the difference between that player's efficiency on those shots and the team's efficiency on those shots without him. 


Now the actual math for this will be off some decimal points because TS% isn't 100% exact as there is a coefficient for free throws that don't use up a possession such as technicals and and-1's. 



In 2000-2001 Shaq took 19.1 FGA and 13.1 FTA. Now since 2 free throws is approximately 1 possession, I'm going to cut them in half to come up with a generally close approximation of how many ""shot possessions"" Shaq used. 
19.1 + 6.5  would be essentially 25.6 ""Shot possessions"" that Shaq used to score his 28.7 points. 

Now if you're not that great with numbers and want to know more in depth how this is calculated I don't mind posting in the comments how, it's relatively simple. Just wanted to save from using up even more space as this post is long enough. 

Now if you take those 25.6 ""Shot possessions"" Shaq used and convert them to how many points the Sixers would score on those possessions(a TS% of 50.2) you will get approximately 25.8 points.

Shaq averaged 28.7, a difference of 2.9. I'll give a margin of error of .5 points because of the TS% coefficient. 

So although Shaq averaged 28.7 PPG, the ""Real"" Value of that scoring to even the 0-18 sixers is about  3 - 3.5 points. Then there's also value in how efficiently Shaq helps his teammates score with his presence and attention which would be another couple points or so. 
 
Shaq's OBPM that year was 5.7, now while it's not a perfect stat, it's  the only one that spans decades for a comparison and is still a general good predictor. When also taking into account the value of his actual scoring as I previously calculated at 3-3.5 points, an OBPM of 5.7 seems reasonable.

If you do the same math for Kobe in 00-01:

He scored 28.5 points on 26.3 ""Shot possessions""

At a TS% of 50.2, the sixers would score approximately 26.4 points on those shots, a difference of 2.1. So with a margin of error, the actual ""Real"" value of Kobe's points were 2-2.7 points.
Then he has added value helping his teammate's score efficiently. His OBPM that year was 5.3


Now for Stephen Curry: Curry is scoring 32.1 points on about 23.5 ""shot possessions""

On those same shot attempts the sixers would score roughly 23.6 points.

An astounding difference of 8.5

So with a Margin of error the ""Real"" Value Of Curry's current scoring is 8.5 - 9 points. Then he also has the added value of how much his presence helps his teammates score efficiently. His OBPM is currently 12.9

That is how INSANLEY valuable efficiency is. The actual value of Curry's Current scoring(8.5-9 points) is greater than Shaq and Kobe's that year COMBINED (5 - 6.2). His OBPM currently (12.9) is also greater than Shaq and Kobe's that year combined (11.2)


To provide even further support (the TEAM's offense) that these players are impacting, the Warriors right now are on pace to have the best offense of all time.


Their offensive rating right now: 115.6

The Lakers offensive rating in 2000-2001: 108.4

A team with Shaq and Kobe is scoring an astronomical 7.2 points less per 100 possessions than the Curry led Warriors.

The Curry we've seen so far this season is a broken blip in the Matrix and goes to show how immensely valuable efficiency is.

I don't care though. I just want to express my thoughts on this whole suspension incident.

So, it seems like every other post in the last 48 hours has been about either how dirty and disrespectful it was of Lebron to step over Draymond, or more recently about how ridiculous the suspension is. Let me get this straight: People are saying that because Lebron stepped over Green (sure, a little disrespectfully) that Draymond's act of slapping Lebron directly in the nuts is entirely justified. 

I just don't get it. We're talking about Draymond Green here, the guy who just a couple weeks ago blatantly kicked Steven Adams in the nuts. And a few days before that kneed him in the nuts. I respect him as a player, but the fact is that he's pretty dirty and occasionally reckless. There are tons of other incidents of his over-physicality and recklessness. Even in these playoffs, to name one, when he threw Michael Beasley to the ground at the end of game
3 of the Houston series. I don't understand where the justification is coming from here. Why in the world are people saying this suspension is BS?? Draymond Green blatantly and intentionally slapped Lebron James in the balls. I think that warrants a suspension.

Now, I understand the notion that the suspension is ridiculous because Draymond didn't get suspended for the kick to Adams last series. I certainly think he should have been suspended for that, but that doesn't make me criticize the NBA for their decision on this incident. Why would they make the same mistake twice? It boils down to this: Draymond Green slapped Lebron James in the nuts. Can someone please explain to me why this suspension is in any way ridiculous?",0.56,controversial,2016-06-13 10:52:00

Last year he was really owned by Bob Voulgaris in Rockets vs Celtics situations stuff, but you could call him being biased, because he’s a fan on one of those teams. 

But at his latest podcast he went even further.

He claimed that Jrue, Lonzo, Ingram and Zion Team is a western conference caliber playoff team. After that he corrected himself, claiming that they are “one move away”, talking about bringing rim protection.

I mean how could you believe in a claim like that seriously, when Jrue is by far their best 3PT shooter among those guys and so-called rim protector, making less than 2FG’s per game on 35% shooting?

Especially after talking for half of an hour approximately about the Lakers, their mess over the last couple of seasons, especially the last one, where the - TA-DAM - lack of consistent shooting clearly ran that team straight into the ground.

I’m cool with him picking 65+ wins for the Boston team, he’s a well-known Celtics homer, but naming the guys and clearly being unable to recognize the weaknesses on a fly is just terrible, especially when you are talking about the potential team around Zion, who’s like Giannis or LeBron is going to get doubled since late October because of how freakishly athletic he really is.

In games Durant played, they had a 57 win pace.

With Durant limited to just 27 games in 2014-15, the Thunder had a losing record in games Durant missed and **failed to make the playoffs** (playing at their typical 57 win pace in games Durant played).   

Not surprisingly, Westbrook's efficiency dropped that season to 42% from FG and 29% from the line.  It seems Durant's presence has a positive effect on Westbrook's efficiency.

Based on this limited sample size, one could make the case that the Thunder, without Durant, would struggle to make the playoffs and might even finish below .500.

One note:  Westbrook missed time that season as well.  I primarily looked at games Durant missed.  But the fact is, with Durant healthy they played at their typical 57 win pace.  Even with him playing 27 games (1/3rd of the season), the Thunder were a lottery team without a fully healthy Durant.  You could make the argument that Durant could join a 48 win team like the Celtics and they'd be more successful than the Thunder this season since the Durantless Celtics might compare favorably to the Durantless Thunder.

-----

How about the reverse? 

Well in 2013-14, Westbrook was limited to just 46 games.  In the 36 games he missed, the Thunder went 25-11 (including a 10 game win streak) - their typical 57 win pace.  The Thunder won 59 games that season in spite of Westbrook missing significant time.  

Additionally, Westbrook's absence seemed to have no negative effect on Durant's production.  In the 35 games Durant played without Westbrook, he put up averages of 32.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.2 steals, 51%/41%/89% shooting in 37.6mpg.   And for the full season, he posted career highs in points and assists - with no noticeable downtick in efficiency.

Based on this limited sample size, one could make the case that the Russell Westbrook's impact on Kevin Durant is similar to the impact Monta Ellis had on Steph Curry.  We might actually see Durant flourish without Westbrook (who has the highest usage rate in the league and has an assist/turnover rate that is 28th in the league).  

----

I understand the common narrative is that because the Thunder had limited success and Westbrook is a Superstar, Durant needs to play with Westbrook to be successful.  Unfortunately, the reality is that the Thunder were likely successful **BECAUSE OF DURANT**.  We once saw LeBron James win 66 games with Mo Williams as his 2nd best player.  Once he left, the Cavs were a 20 win team.  Do not discount the possibility that Durant, a legitimate Superstar, is the primary reason for the Thunder's success - and he may see even greater success by going to a team that has more complimentary pieces.

———-

I think a fair point is made here. Kobe has and will always be fixated on ego. Detail is just a way for him to channel that. He made an episode criticizing LBJ, who plays a much better style of basketball than he does, jacking up midrange shots. 

Kobe, in his NBA career not including his rookie or post-Achilles seasons, had an eFg% of 48.7% (1.1% more than Iman Shumpert excluding his rookie year). Averaged only 5 assists per game as the primary ball handler. When Lakers bring up his 55.6% TS to defend him, they neglect to mention that the league average is 55%.",0.46,controversial,2018-05-31 04:29:39

Think about it. If the season comes back sure we'll have all the players wearing ""I Can't Breathe"" shirts and maybe some of the courts will have the BLM logo and hashtags on them. Players will kneel and some of them will give heartfelt tributes, but that's it.

If players refuse to play, that will send a huge message to the world about what's going on more so than just wearing ""I Can't Breathe"" Shirts. Not to say these shirts don't have an impact, because they absolutely do have an impact, but outright refusing to play due to the current racial atmosphere would be huge!

I've been swallowing my comments day in and day out while /r/nba hops on hivemind thought after hivemind thought about whatever random trend is occurring.  In the big scheme of things, I don't mind at all, because /r/nba is always top notch in delivering player news and any other general news regarding the NBA.  /r/nba is first, and /r/nba is the best.  This is your/our shtick, and the community has it down.
Now
..
I've been reading Simmons for years now and he's a very, very entertaining, passionate fan and writer.  He loves the NBA, he loves sports, he loves pop culture, and he's a great read.  He's Entertaining.  Take him with several grains of salt and he's always fun to ingest.
BUT..
/r/nba has taken it to the next level.  You guys have begun taking whatever he says as canon and shouting it repeatedly and downvoting anyone to hell who doesn't agree.  This is bullshit.  Pure, unadulterated, bullshit.

Bill Simmons has been a self professed biased, conspiracy theory loving, drama seeking, storyline creating (even when one doesn't exist) writer Ever Since He Begun Writing.  People who have been reading him for years ARE USED TO IT.  We laugh at it.  Hell, I happily read Grantland daily, and have done so for years.  Years!  I am seriously wondering how many who are touting his words as gospel have even been closely watching the NBA for years.  I remember watching Kings (I am not even a Kings fan) league pass games well into the night and waking up the next morning to him giving incorrect assessments of what happened in those games down the stretch.  He's a good writer, but he will absolutely turn events to a way where it's exciting to read about and sometimes might not have happened.  We (longtime Simmons readers) Know to take it with many grains of salt.  ALL OF THE SUDDEN, after being introduced to this terrible ESPN crew, people are randomly taking his word as gospel.  It Is Not.  Some of it is great, and some of it is wrong.

Bill Simmons is a great fan, but he also interprets scenarios wrong and creates drama and storylines where none exist.  He pushes his agenda, like when he tries to promote one player over another and argues this assertion by recounting all the ""possible"" championships that a player ""should"" have (ala Tim Duncan, when he recounts all the ""once in a lifetime"" things that had to happen to keep him from several of his potential other championships... yet doesn't do the same argument [an argument that can easily be made] for other players) and says this should theoretically count towards a players legacy.  This is his thing.  He loves conjecture.  And That Is Okay!

What he is doing with Doc is conjecture and Celtics love mixed with heartbreak that his team is tearing apart.  It's clear that Doc and he now have bad blood, but for everyone to Immediately hop on his side as if he's done NOTHING wrong in ""calling out a coach"" who did nothing wrong besides seeking new employment is downright stupid.  Their beef now is strong, and I see both parties' point, in a manner.  Yet, the initial problem with Doc being offended at Simmons taking aim at him is absolutely valid.  No matter how much you guys want to love Everything Bill Simmons does: you need to relax.  There's a happy medium where you don't have to downvote every comment that doesn't praise him to being below threshold, where you can have an open enough mind to realize the situation from both sides.

Also Heats play lately. Bosh has been playing arguably his best ball of his career for stretches. Wade seems completely comfortable out there and playing the best stretch of ball he has also played in a long time. Chalmers has also been, in my opinion, one of the most important pieces to the Heat of late and Lebron has CLEARLY turned it post all star despite the broken nose clearly making a statement game vs Durant.  Oden getting his first start in 4 years and becoming a factor. Battier getting his shot back etc. I feel a big push / possible number 1 seed.

203,[Serious] Why Are People Against Kawhi?,0,8d2b0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8d2b0p/serious_why_are_people_against_kawhi/,92,1524047650.0,"Genuinely curious why it seems like quite a few people on this sub seem to side with the Spurs in this situation. This is all based on the information we as fans have, we obviously don't know EXACTLY what's going on. 

No one knows how Kawhi's body is feeling except for Kawhi, not even a team doctor. The fact that Tony Parker brought up his injury and said it was much worse was extremely disrespectful from my point of view. 

Kawhi has an outside medical team looking at his injury and they have not cleared him. This isn't his uncle saying he isn't healthy but trained professionals just like the team's doctors. This isn't to say that team doctors are compromised in any way but they definitely look out for the team and if it seems like Kawhi is say 95% ready they would probably clear him, while there is no incentive for an outside medical team to have any agenda. 

There have been players who have played through an injury and it ended up being a terrible decision. IT is a recent example of this. Yes, he also played due to personal reasons as he said it helped him cope with the death of his sister but he also wishes he got surgery sooner rather than play through it as it affected his play which is lowering his value. I don't think he would have ever gotten a max contract but it sure as hell would have been higher than what he's going to get now. If he sat out for the whole year coming off his play in Boston, it's likely he would have gotten more than he's gonna get now. 

The Spurs organization has been a model organization for the past 20 years but taking subtle shots at Kawhi is extremely unprofessional. If he doesn't feel ready, it's as simple as that. He isn't ready to play. They obviously want him to play because they pay him to play basketball and they need him to be an actual threat in the West. So while they care to have Kawhi healthy because he's their Super-Star player and want him to be healthy for years to come, they have an agenda in they also need him to play as soon as possible. While an outside medical staff has none of that and only want to get Kawhi healthy. 

Kawhi isn't ""quitting"" on his team just because he doesn't feel ready to play. I can also guarantee the subtle shots aren't motivating him to return either but rather more of a reason for him to stay away from playing until he's fully 100%. 

edit: TLDR; Kawhi doesn't feel 100% healthy and his outside medical staff who have absolutely no agenda aside from getting him healthy have not cleared him. The subtle shots from the Spurs are unprofessional and aren't going to encourage him to come back. There's no reason to think Kawhi is simply ""quitting"" on the team with the information we have.",0.5,controversial,2018-04-18 03:34:10

Russ was generally thought of as the 7th best player after last season, and while you can make the case he should be ahead of Kawhi until we see Kawhi play again, this was fair. Then people started putting Giannis above Russ and that started a trend of massively underrating Westbrook. Threads have shown up asking if he’s a top 10 player and people are calling him a net negative to a team.

After a whirlwind off season - surely the craziest in NBA history - I'd like to share my predictions for each team as I see them and create a ""way too early"" Power Rankings.  Without further ado...

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Denver Nuggets** \- I may be biased, but people are absolutely sleeping on Denver.  While they had a quiet off season, the addition of Jerami Grant was the perfect compliment to their already young and deep roster.  Toting the best center in the game in Nikola Jokic, Denver runs one of the best offenses in the NBA predicated on ball and player movement. They will be elite both offensively and defensively.  Jamal Murray will make his case for a top 5 PG in the game next season.  While other teams in the West made huge splashes, the Nuggets didn't need to.  They are absolutely deep and talented at every position.  Denver was the 2 seed last season and almost (should have) made it to the WCF.  Aside from having the best young core in the league, they also have the most intriguing prospect outside of Zion in Michael Porter Jr.  The playoff run they had last season was invaluable experience.  Watch out for the Nuggets.
2. **Los Angeles Clippers** \- Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is a ridiculous tandem on both ends of the floor.  Both are elite offense players and lock-down wing defenders.  Aside from these two, the Clippers are deep with players such as Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Ivica Zubac, and Landry Shamet.  The defensive trio of Bev/Klaw/PG13 is scary.  Lou Williams will continue to be the perfect 6th man and will be vital to ensure two elite offensive players are on the floor at all times.  I love the energy and competitiveness of Harrell, and the Clips have two great young players in Zubac and Shamet.  Shamet is the closest thing to Curry we've seen yet.  Doc Rivers is still one of the better coaches in the league and will have the respect of Kawhi and PG13.  If I can find an issue that this team may have it would be playmaking, as both of their stars aren't know to create much for others.
3. **Los Angeles Lakers** \- The Clippers and Lakers are now 1A and 1B in Los Angeles. LeBron James and Anthony Davis are arguably the best pair of teammates to ever play together.  People forget about AD.  Anthony Davis is absolutely dominant and I look forward to him reminding people of that this season.  He is unbelievably good, and if you didn't know already, LeBron is still that guy.  They missed out on Kawhi, but they sure made up for it in Free Agency.  The Lakers filled out their roster with the likes of Cousins, Danny Green, Bradley, KCP, Rondo, and McGee, while retaining one of the best young players in the game in Kuzma.  It'll be fun to see how they all play together, but this team looks very strong on paper.  Some sports books in Vegas now have the Lakers as the favorite to win it all.
4. **Milwaukee Bucks** \- Fear the Deer.  While the West has exploded, the Bucks are on top in the East for now.  Milwaukee dominated last season in both the regular season and playoffs.  Reigning MVP Giannis will be even better and their core stayed intact minus Brodgon.  Losing Brogon was a significant hit for them, but they still have Bledsoe and Hill at the PG, and they picked up Wesley Matthews which is a sneaky good add.  Khris Middleton continues to make his case as an elite SG, and they retained Brook ""Splash Mountain"" Lopez.  The Bucks also have a great coach and offensive system, to go along with tremendous length on the defensive end.  A number of teams will challenge them in the East next season, but I wouldn't underestimate the Bucks in the East while the West dukes it out with each other.
5. **Philadelphia 76ers** \- Philly has a mind-boggling starting 5 now.  Simmons, Richardson, Harris, Horford, Embiid.  Here is the height of their starting lineup:  6'10, 6'6, 6'9, 6'10, 7'0.  Yikes.  Reddick (and Butler) were losses for them, but Richardson is a major improvement at SG (way better defender, still a very good shooter), and the addition of Horford is amazing.  Al Horford is one of the best overall players in the league and surely underrated, both on the court and in the locker room.  This team will be a problem, but it will have to be seen how they mesh together.  Their bench is questionable to say the least.  I guess Mike Scott is the 6th best player now.  I'm not sold on the Sixers just yet, but their starting 5 is probably the best in the league.
6. **Utah Jazz** \- The Jazz, like the Nuggets, are being slept on by most of the national media.  They were the #1 defensive team in the league last season.  They struggled on offense in the playoffs when Mitchell was the sole option on most plays.  Adding Conley is the absolute nut add for this team.  Conley adds another offensive weapon and clutch performer to relieve Mitchell of playmaking duties down the stretch.  He is also an elite individual defender and a good culture guy that will fit right in.  I like Rubio, too, but Conley fits so much better with this group, I was really happy to see him go to Utah.  Aside from Conley, they are well coached and know how to move the ball.  Joe Ingles is an underrated SF who will be better when he can kick out to Conley instead of Rubio to space the floor.  These guys are young too and have real chemistry.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Stifle Tower and Co. secure a 3rd or 4th seed in the West.
7. **Houston Rockets** \- Westbrook to the Rockets, Wow!  It's an amazing time to be an NBA fan.  Following this FA has been crazy, I can't think of a time when so many teams were loading up.  I can't wait to see how this team will mesh, but I'm not quite sold yet that they will.  Westbrook and Harden were the #1 and #2 highest usage % players in the league the last 5 seasons.  Something has to give.  Harden had almost 0 assisted field goals last year, and Westbrook is not a good spot up shooter.  They will have to change their style, but I am excited to see how it works.  They still have a very good young center in Capela, and a dark horse 6th man of the year candidate in Eric Gordon.  I'd like to see Westbrook pushing the pace up the floor and running with Capela, with Harden getting the ball later in the shot clock.  We will see if Harden can adapt his game to play more SG and move without the ball... something he has been notorious for not doing.  Regardless, the Rockets will have two MVPs now who are hungry for success.
8. **Golden State Warriors** \- Maybe I'm sleeping on the Warriors, or maybe the NBA is just that stacked.  The Warriors lost Kevin Durant, but they still have Curry, Klay, and Draymond.  Plus they've added Russell and solid backups in Burks and Cauley-Stein.  The Warriors should absolutely still be in the mix, and if they are, Curry has a very good shot at MVP.  It will be interesting to see how well Kerr coaches this team and adjusts to these changes.  D-Lo is someone I never imagined on the Warriors, but I guess I didn't envision Durant or Cousins joining them, either.  One thing for sure is he is one of the best young players in the league and should be on his best behavior with the Warriors.  I am higher on Cauley-Stein than most, and Draymond should be a good mentor for him.  Their bench is questionable (though it has been) and Klay will be out for the first part of the season.
9. **Portland Trail Blazers** \- Dame and McCollum showed last season that they are definitely in the discussion for the best back court in the league.  Unfortunately for them, Nurkic was out during their playoff run.  Those guys are all in their primes and have a wealth of experience together.  Portland got rid of their long wings in Harkless and Aminu, but they added much needed scoring and defensive presence on the wing in Kent Bazemore.  I also like their pick up of Mario Hezonja, a talented player that hasn't had much of a shot in the league so far.  Lastly, they acquired Hassan Whiteside which would have been more of a blockbuster move a couple years ago, but even now it is a significant addition.  Whiteside should be on his best behavior in Portland where he even knows that he's not the best player on the team.  The Blazers are very good and should fight for 50+ wins next season.
10. **Boston Celtics** \- Boston is under the radar once again, just where they want to be.  While Kemba isn't exactly an upgrade over Kyrie, he should be a superior compliment to this team as an All-NBA PG without any drama/leadership issues.  Kemba should fit Boston's offense perfectly; he is an excellent catch-and-shoot player and extremely fast with the ball.  Losing Horford is significant, I would have Boston higher if they still held on to Al.  With that being said, Kanter is a decent pick up (they needed rebounding) and probably a better team defender then he gets credit for. Hayward should have a much better year this time around, as well as Tatum and Brown.  Locker room chemistry is vital - especially for young guys - and they just didn't have it last season.  Brad Stevens is still one of the best coaches in the NBA. Players should buy into his system 100% this season, I fully expect Boston to be top 4 in the East.
11. **Brooklyn Nets** \- Brooklyn already had many young, talented players (Dinwiddie, Harris, LeVert, Allen) before adding Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  Not to mention Taurean Prince (underrated signing) and DeAndre Jordan (overrated signing).  They are well coached and will compete with anyone.  If Durant wasn't injured for the year, the Nets could be the best team in the East.  Even without Durant, however, this team will be very good.  I can't see Kyrie having the same kind of negative effect on this team as he did in Boston... but who knows.  Irving is a superstar PG that will have very good shooters around him and a young big man in Jarrett Allen with all the promise in the world.  When D-Lo was injured, Dinwiddie stepped up and was the best player on the team for a stretch of time.  The Nets will definitely make the playoffs, and if KD can come back during that time they have a real shot at making it to the Finals.
12. **Indiana Pacers** \- I love the way this team has re-tooled.  The Pacers were very good the last couple of years, even when Oladipo was out.  They are tenacious on defense and play well together offensively.  Indiana almost made a real run in the playoffs when Oladipo was healthy.  They lost Bogan Bogdanovic which hurts, but they picked up TJ Warren to replace him.  Malcolm Brogdon joined this team which creates a formidable backcourt alongside Oladipo.  I absolutely love Sabonis, and Myles Turner is set to have a career year next season.  Another underrated signing is Jeremy Lamb who was arguably the Hornet's best young player after Kemba left.  I may even be underestimating on this projection, but Oladipo will be out at the beginning of the season and it will take some time to build chemistry with so many new faces.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Indiana take as high as a 3 seed in the East.
13. **San Antonio Spurs** \- Death, Taxes, and the Spurs making the playoffs.  While the West this year is absolutely bonkers, I believe the 8 seed is up for grabs between teams like the Spurs, Mavericks, Kings, and maybe Pelicans.  The Spurs were bad defensively (by their standards) last year and they still took the Nuggets to 7 games in the first round.  They will be much better on that end this year as  Dejounte Murray is fully healthy, Derrick White is an absolute menace (the Spurs never disappoint when it comes to developing young guys like White), and the best player in the Summer League, Lonnie Walker IV, becoming a rotational player and defensive stopper.  The NBA is stacked with powerful duos now, and the Spurs still have one in Demar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge.  Marcus Morris would've been a great fit, but picking up Carroll and Lyles (possibly) are good additions as well.
14. **Dallas Mavericks** \- The Mavs are one of the teams that I'm most excited about.  They are extremely well coached  and surprisingly deep.  Porzingis has been injured, but look for him to be a top 15 player next season.  7'3 with a high basketball IQ and excellent shooting touch.  Doncic had one of the best rookie campaigns ever and I expect him to improve upon that after a full year of conditioning, NBA training, etc.  Aside from these two, they picked up Delon Wright (super underrating signing) to play PG and to play defense.  Brunson was great on offense, but between him and Luka the Mavs got scorched.  Tim Hardaway Jr. is the perfect third option on this team, and they also have Justin Jackson and Seth Curry.  The Mavs also resigned both of their young &amp; athletic centers.  This team has filled out nicely and it will be fun to watch Doncic and Porzingis under Rick Carlisle.
15. **New Orleans Pelicans** \- What rebuild?  New Orleans traded the best player they've ever had for a haul of young talent and draft picks, plus lucked out on the #1 draft pick that turned into Zion Williamson.  This team will be good right away.  Lonzo Ball and Jrue Holiday instantly become a lock down defensive back court.  Lonzo should do better on this team away from the spotlight of L.A.  Jrue Holiday is one of the best guards in the game and should be the leader from day 1.  Brandom Ingram should average 20+ PPG this season and cement himself as one of the premier scoring threats in the league.  They also have a lot of shooting in Redick, Hart, Moore, and Miller.  Derrick Favors was another good signing, and Okafor showed signs of life recently.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if this team makes some noise right away and fights for a playoff spot.
16. **Toronto Raptors** \- The defending champions lost both Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.  Still, the rest of their championship core is intact (Lowry, VanVleet, Powell, Siakam, Gasol, Ibaka).  They play well together and have one of the better coaches in the NBA.  While most of the NBA will have to figure out chemistry on the fly, the Raptors already have their continuity.  Of course a team without Kawhi is going to be worse, but the Raptors are still formidable and will make the playoffs next season.  They played well in the games he didn't play last season, and bottom line is that this group knows how to win and play together.  Aging veterans Lowry and Gasol definitely have some left in the tank, and I look for Siakam to take another step and cement himself as the best player on the team.
17. **Sacramento Kings** \- Another sneaky young team who can make some noise this year is the Kings.  De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield make up a young &amp; formidable back court that's gotten better each season.  Buddy Hield shot 43% from 3 last season at around 5 attempts per game, and Fox has a tremendous feel for the game for such a young player, not to mention his quickness and athleticism.  One move that seemed to go under the radar is signing Dewayne Dedmon.  He is a very good center who is still only 29 years old and surely an upgrade from Cauley-Stein.  They resigned Harrison Barnes (meh), still have Bogdon Bogdonovic, picked up Trevor Ariza, and have one of the best young prospects in Marvin Bagley III.  They will be competitive on any given night; we will see how things come together under new head coach Luke Walton.
18. **Phoenix Suns** \- I am higher on the new-look Suns than most.  They have reshaped their roster (and coaching staff) tremendously despite some questionable draft moves.  First of all, Monty Williams is a game changer from a coaching standpoint.  Next, Ricky Rubio was the perfect addition to their team.  He is the ideal PG to play alongside Booker and to set up Ayton and other shooters, plus he is a good defender with size that will help Booker on that end as well.  The Kelly Oubre signing was critical.  He is only 23 years old and a much better of a basketball player than people give him credit for, plus his locker room presence has been crucial in bringing these young guys together.  Mikal Bridges was a steal in last year's draft, and Dario Saric was added as the ideal 4 to play along side Ayton.  Lastly, Aron Baynes as the backup C has been another underrated pickup.  Most importantly, Devin Booker is the best player in the league under 22 years old.  The Suns have real promise now, even if they won't make the playoffs next season.
19. **Miami Heat** \- Josh Richardson is gone, Jimmy Butler is in.  Whiteside is out which solidifies Bam Adebayo's spot as the starting center.  Even though Richardson is a nice young player, Jimmy Butler is definitely an upgrade.  He should flourish in the role of top dog and his competitiveness will be a welcome sight to an already scrappy group of guys. They have good players on this team like Dragic, Winslow, Waiters and Johnson.  I really like their draft pick at #13, Tyler Herro.  We'll see if the Heat upgrade again with the likes of CP3 or Beal, but regardless they will be a competitive team that should make the playoffs, even if their overall talent is a bit lacking compared to most of the league.
20. **Orlando Magic** \- Run it back!  The Magic have basically the same roster as last season except for the addition of Aminu.  They were one of the hottest teams to end last season, as well as one of the best defensively.  Orlando is filled with long, athletic defenders.  Nikola Vucevic is  one of the best centers in the game.  Aaron Gordon is interesting; he is an explosive athlete with a lot of talent that just hasn't seemed to put it together yet.  Issac is their prized young player who they've been very careful with.  This team will be tough if Gordon can put it together and they can stay healthy.
21. **Minnesota Timberwolves** \- The Timberwolves have been one of the most hopeful teams in recent years that have surely failed to meet expectations.  Let's not talk about Wiggins, but Karl-Anthony Towns is an absolute monster!  I look for KAT to finally fully take control of this team and dominate on both ends of the floor.  He absolutely has the ability to be in the discussion for Top 10 players, but he isn't yet.  There's not a whole lot else on this team, but i do really love Robert Covington (the perfect 3 and D player), and I like their guards Napier and Okogie.  They took Culver with the #6 pick in the draft who will likely step in and contribute immediately.
22. **Detroit Pistons** \- Blake Griffin played his heart out last season and gained a lot of people's respect.  Andre Drummond is a beast on the boards and has improved defensively every season.  Problem with the Pistons as I see it is a lack of playmaking guards and wings.  Most of their offense is predicated around dumping the ball off to Griffin and having him create every time.  Reggie Jackson is good but wildly inefficient.  I like the pickup of Derrick Rose, and Markieff Morris wasn't bad either.  Hopefully Luke Kennard can have a breakout season and provide some much needed spacing for this team.
23. **Atlanta Hawks** \- The Hawks are a fun team to watch.  Trae Young has brought a new kind of energy to the team and I'm sure it's an exciting time to be a Hawks fan.  They have a lot of young talent in Young, Huerter, and especially Collins.  John Collins is one of my favorite players in the NBA.  Super athletic and competitive, plus he's only 21 years old!  ATL will continue to improve and be a force in the NBA after some time.  Jabari Parker was an interesting pick up, he is much better than most give him credit for and should have the opportunity to show that here.  Lastly, they drafted De'Andre Hunter with the #4 pick in the draft, he should come in and contribute immediately.
24. **Chicago Bulls** \- Another promising young team.  Lauri Markkanen broke records in his rookie season and now he should be fully healthy and ready to go.  They drafted Coby White who may end up to be a very good PG in this league.  Zach LaVine is supremely talented on the offensive end, I look for him to improve on the other end as well as he continues to develop.  The Bulls had some nice pickups recently -- Otto Porter last season (huge), and Tomas Satoransky and Thaddeus Young in the off season.  Satoransky may be the best PG on the team when the season starts, he filled in nicely on the Wizards when Wall was injured and he seems to be the right compliment to LaVine in the back court.
25. **New York Knicks** \- What an off season!  The Knicks signed KD, Irving, and drafted Zion Williamson with the #1 overall pick.  Oh wait... In all seriousness, the Knicks did alright to fill out their roster with the likes of Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Marcus Morris, and Bobby Portis.  Randle should feast on this team.  RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr. is definitely two young players to be excited about.  I also like Allonzo Trier, and Kevin Knox has a high ceiling.  Last but not least, Mitchell Robinson may just lead the league in blocks next year.  The New York Knicks will think they can make the playoffs next season.  We'll see.
26. **Washington Wizards** \- The Wizards are in a tough situation with bloated contracts and specifically John Wall being injured.  With that being said, Bradley Beal is an elite SG and all signs are positive with Wall's progress and recovery.  They also have a solid young center in Thomas Bryant.  I think they should have kept Tomas Satoransky, but they did add some rotational players in CJ Miles and Davis Bertans.  Bertans is one of the purest shooters and hardest working professionals, was sad to see him leave San Antonio but he should do well in Washington.  They drafted Rui Hachimura with the #9 pick and he looks impressive.
27. **Memphis Grizzlies** \- With the #2 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, Memphis Grizzlies select Ja Morant!  This kid may be special.  I was pleased to see him go to the Grizzlies after how professionally they handled breaking up their cornerstones in Conley and Gasol.  Jaren Jackson Jr. is a very good young prospect, I think he will be one of the better players in the league in the coming years.  Outside of these two young guys, you could do worse than Jonas  Valanciunas at center, and I also like Dillon Brooks' game.  The timeline of success for this team should rest on how quick and significant of an impact Morant will have.
28. **Cleveland Cavaliers** \- Annual losers since LeBron left, the Cavs don't have a whole lot going for them.  Kevin Love is still the man on this team, and much of their success will be reliant on Love staying healthy.  Collin Sexton has been good so far and they drafted Darius Garland at #5.  Maybe those two players will become a formidable duo in the back court.  Cedi Osman is a versatile player and an above-average SF.  I've always like Larry Nance Jr. Hope for the Cavs at this point has to be in Sexton and Garland's hands.
29. **Oklahoma City Thunder** \- After losing Paul George and Russell Westbrook, OKC will fall the farthest from contention to bottom dweller.  With that being said, they have a lot of promise with the multitude of first round picks they've acquired and a young prospect named Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.  Chris Paul is likely to be traded, so as it stands this team is pretty thin.   Aside from Shai, Schroder is a decent guard and Danilo Gallinari will become the team's best player.  Steven Adams should have a more dominant impact on the boards.  Sam Presti has always worked magic in the front office, and this season is no different (despite losing PG and Westbrook).
30. **Charlotte Hornets** \- Charlotte lost Kemba and replaced him with Terry Rozier.  I don't hate Rozier but that contract is objectively bad.  Scary Terry is one of the most inefficient players in the league, though I do think he will have a better season this year as the #1 option at PG.  They also lost maybe their best young player in Jeremy Lamb.  Malik Monk should be freed with an unlimited green light on offense.  Plus, maybe we can see more of super-athletic Miles Bridges unlocking his euro step windmill dunk.  Ultimately, the outlook is dire for the Charlotte Hornets; It's ironic that the best player to ever play is the owner of the worst team in the NBA.",0.51,controversial,2019-07-14 09:57:43

Game 3:
Mavericks up 83-71 with 8:30 left. A lot of people claim that the refs took over here and helped guide Wade to victory.
Up to the 3rd quarter Wade had shot 15 free throws. In the 4th quarter, Wade shot only 3 free throws, and only 1 free throw within the 8:30 left. So the two other free throws he shot were before the 12 point lead the Mavs had.

Not to mention with the game score was 97-95 in favor of the Heat with 3 seconds to go and Dirk gets given 2 free throws. So the Mavs were given a chance to tie the game, and Dirk only hit 1 of 2 free throws to make the score 97-96 in favor of the Heat. 

So in actual fact, Wade got no free throws in that 8:30, due to the free throws he recieved being out of desperation and the Mavs hacking to be able to get another shot off. So a total of 0 shooting fouls were called for Wade in the 4th.
___

Game 4:
98-74 win for the Heat. Mavs shot 31% and Wade had 9 free throws. Nothing to talk about really. Mavs completely outplayed.
___
Game 5:
This is the game where Wade goes onto shoot as many free throws as the entire Dallas team. 21-25 went Wade and 21-25 went Dallas. Game went into overtime as well.
Wade had 22 points going into the 4th quarter. Wade scored 17 in the 4th quarter with the last 6 points all coming from jumpers. Even the game tying shot was a jumper to level the game at 93-93 with 2 seconds left. No free throws needed. 7 of Wade's 17 points came from FT's. So he basically maintained his average foul shot per quarter rate in the 4th.

Then in the overtime, the score was 100-99 in favor of the Mavs with 2 seconds left and Wade was given 2 free throws. As many of you know, at the time there was great debate as to whether this was a foul or not. The play involved Harris and Nowitzki both hacking Wade and Nowitzki being called for the foul.

http://imgur.com/E1DQBuo

That was the play for those who have forgot. Many people say this wasn't a foul. Now take a look at what happened on this play:

http://imgur.com/NKVuJ3u

Harris' leg clearly fouling Wade.

Also:
Dirk giving Wade a huge shove, just look at the amount of contact.

http://imgur.com/71sl2Vf

Not to mention Harris grabbed Wade's other hand on the way to the basket. He didn't just slap it, but grabbed it and didn't allow Wade to have shooting motion. That is a foul even in late game situations. Two players hacking and getting a huge amount of contact. On his leg, one arm and pushing on his back. That has to get called even in the dying seconds. 

http://imgur.com/2gs1nV3



Harris' grabbing Wade's shooting arm, pretty much not allowing a shot to be attempted.
___
Game 6:
Heat win the championship with a 95-92 win.


**Interesting facts**:

With this all summed up, there are certain other facts.
In this playoff run, Dirk Nowitzki sets a record for must FT's hit during the playoffs shooting 209-229. Wade on the other hand shoots 202-250 with both players playing 23 games in the playoffs that year. For a player who is more of a slasher, Wade only managed to get 21 more free throws? So I guess it really is rigged, right?  

Furthermore, Wade shot 10 and 14 free throws in the first two games, so its not like he just got more free throws the next few games. He was already getting to the line a lot.

The total foul count in the series was 146 fouls commited by the Miami Heat and 160 fouls commited by the Mavericks. Fairly equal if anything. Furthermore, it's amazing it was soo close considering the Heat have Shaq and Wade on their team. Wade is a driver who gets a lot of free throws anyway, and Shaq is a guy who teams love to send to the line. Also, the Mavericks were more of a jumpshooting teams, with most of their driving coming from Harris and Howard.

**Quick facts**:


Miami outrebounded the Mavs in 4 of the 6 games in the series.
In the 4 games Miami won, they shot better in 3 of those matchups, with the only time they shot worse being by .8 of a %.
Miami shot less threes then the Dallas team in 5 of the 6 games. The one time they shot more threes then the Dallas team, they lost.


So just for you doubters, hopefully you come through and realize that the NBA is not out to make one team win and one team lose.

213,"What LeBron James gets wrong (about the NFL's slave mentality, and about crowning himself as the GOAT)",11,abjduo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/abjduo/what_lebron_james_gets_wrong_about_the_nfls_slave/,48,1546388611.0,"Ever since moving to Los Angeles full time, LeBron James has been making headlines for his stellar play and some questionable comments. Let's ignore the rap lyrics (because even as a Jewish person, I couldn't care less) and focus on the more substantive debates.
 
**The NFL owners have a ""slave mentality""**
 
The comments: *""In the NFL they got a bunch of old white men owning teams, and they got that slave mentality.' And it's like, 'This is my team. You do what the fuck I tell y'all to do or we get rid of y'all.' ""*

I don’t like using the slavery comparison because it betrays the gravity of those moral crimes, but there’s definitely some truth to this if you take that as exaggeration for emphasis. NFL players have FAR less power than NBA players. They're treated worse. They don't have full guaranteed contracts. In contrast, NBA players are treated like kings.
 
But what LeBron James either misses or excludes here is the reason *why.*
 
He implies (not directly said) that one reason for this disparity is the leadership of the two leagues -- both in the commissioner's office, and among the player union and leadership. As he explains:
 
*""[Adam Silver] doesn't mind us having... a real feeling and to be able to express that. It doesn't even matter if Adam agrees with what we are saying, he at least wants to hear us out.""*
 
Again, the implication here is that the difference in treatment is partly due to a difference in mentality and leadership. LeBron James has always been a champion of player empowerment, and he deserves credit for that. Under his leadership (formal or informal), NBA players have taken a much more active role in the direction of their teams and their careers.
 
However, there's a fundamental difference between NBA players and NFL players. Simply put, **NBA players matter more.**
 
Part of this is simple math. An NBA player is 1/5 of the starting lineup. An NFL player is 1/22 (if you include offense and defense.) By that basis alone, the NBA player has a more serious impact on the game result. An NFL quarterback is arguably even more important, but that's a single position. A great NBA player can have a phenomenal impact from any position on the court, largely because they can control the flow on offense and will still play a role on defense as well.
 
Do you know what athlete is the *most* empowered? Floyd Mayweather Jr. Because, after all, he’s 1 of 1. Mayweather can make $100M+ dollars for a fight. Even beyond that (because the pay-per-view aspect skews the money), he can control the event, the time, the venue, the preliminary matches, etc, down to every last detail. He doesn’t need a full league or a tournament - he needs one other guy to beat. He effectively produces the show himself. There may have been a time when superstar boxers like Mike Tyson got taken advantage of, but Mayweather realizes his value and the power and influence he can yield. As you expand the numbers in team sports, you naturally get less and less impactful on the results of the match. 
 
In a sport with 22 starters and 52 man rosters, the impact and power dynamics are entirely different. The NFL realizes that none of their players (save quarterbacks) matter much at all. That can be good or bad. It's good in the sense that the Kansas City Chiefs can cut a bad egg like Kareem Hunt: knowing full well that they can replace him easily. Arguably, it's bad because they can ostracize players like Colin Kaepernick. If you're not a stud QB, you don't matter much.
 
The other reason that NBA players have more power than NFL players is the **injury factor** (and shelf-life factor.) An NFL player who's great at 24 years old may very well be over the hill by age 28. That's far less true of the NBA. There may be injuries here and there, but we can generally expect someone like Giannis Antetokounmpo to be a good player for the next 3-4 years at least.
 
In the NFL, the specter of injuries looms much larger and affects far more players. The reason their contracts are not fully guaranteed is for this specific reason. They can't predict who's going to be healthy next year, and thus can't commit a bunch of their cap space in the process. If they did (and had to guarantee a contract for the life of the deal), they may not have enough healthy bodies to fill out a roster.
 
The fact that the NFL/NCAA requires football players to stay on campus for 3 full seasons also exacerbates that concern. A lot of players *enter* the NFL with wear and tear on their bodies. In the NBA, teams love young players on rookie deals because they know they'll be affordable -- and will rocket up in price afterwards. In the NFL, teams love young players on rookie deals because they know that their career may be *finished* by the time the deal ends.
 
Another huge factor is the degree of **coaching involvement.** In the NBA, coaches do call some plays and run some systems, but not nearly to the level that NFL coaches do. NFL coordinators are calling 100% of the plays on the field (and coordinators calling defenses against those plays.) The Xs-and-Os is a giant chess match, of which the coaches/coordinators play a huge role. We can see recently how young quarterbacks like Jared Goff, or Mitchell Trubisky, or even Patrick Mahomes have thrived thanks in part to bright offensive coaches.
 
The importance of NFL coaching and offensive/defensive system also contributes to a feeling that players matter less (than NBA players.) Partly as a result of that (and other factors we mentioned), NFL free agency is not nearly as important as NBA free agency. NFL teams can't be sure if a certain player will succeed in their particular system and for their particular coach. Nnamdi Asomugha was the world's top cornerback in Oakland, only to underwhelm in Philadelphia's system. We don't hear nearly as much concern like that in the NBA. Perhaps the closest was some murmurs that Kawhi Leonard may be worse outside of Gregg Popovich's system in San Antonio but -- as it turns out -- it didn't matter much at all.
 
Certainly, coaching matters in the NBA to some degree, but it matters *less.* And as a result, it reinforces the point that NBA players matter *more.* Conversely, NFL coaching matters more -- so players matter less. Tom Brady may be the greatest QB of all-time, but he arguably matters less than his own coach. You would never think that in the NBA.
 
Given that, it's easier to understand the power dynamics of the sports. In the NFL, coaches can loom over players, while the opposite is true in the NBA. As a result, NBA franchises need to do everything in their power to keep their stars happy, or go out of their way to sweet talk and recruit new ones into the fold. They kowtow to players -- not out of kindness or liberal leanings, but out of necessity. That deference flows through to the unions and CBAs as well.
 
Again, there's some truth to what LeBron James is saying. NFL owners are indeed older, more white, and more politically conservative (with wealth more often inherited). And, NFL players are indeed treated worse than NBA players. But those two are not inherently linked. 
 
Simply, NFL players are treated worse because they matter less. That's not a mentality; that's a reality.
 
**The greatest of all time**

The comments: *I was super, super ecstatic to win one for Cleveland because of the 52-year [championship] drought. And then after I stopped, I was like, that one right there made you the greatest player of all time.*
 
First of all, I hate judging a current player against a retired one, because we're only partly through the process. That'd be like me watching *A Star is Born* and then standing and screaming ""This is the best movie of the year!"" in the middle of the second act. Relax. We have plenty of time for those discussions later on.
 
When the dust is settled on LeBron James' career, he may very well be the greatest basketball player of all time. But to me, his greatest argument is his consistency and **longevity.** James averaged 27-7-7 by Year 2, and may very well be doing the same through Year 22. *That's* his best path to being the GOAT. The guy is a basketball machine – which stands in contrast to Michael Jordan who did take some time off (on an earnest baseball journey or on a secret suspension, depending on how much of a conspiracy theorist you are.) James didn't skip a beat. He kept playing, over and over and over, and ruled his sport over and over and over. That's a legitimate argument in his favor.
 
What James (and James defenders) should not fall into is a: ""ringgzzz"" argument. Nor should they. As mentioned in the section above, a basketball player can have an enormous impact on a game (compared to a football player.) That said, they're not boxers. They're not playing 1 on 1. They're playing 5 on 5. And those variables add more complexity to the argument than the simple:
""rings = greatness"" argument.

But rather than acknowledge the silliness there, James decided to embrace the ring narrative and simply move the goal posts to suggest that his title should be worth double (or triple? Or 4x?). Personally, I'd take issue with the idea that James' ring in Cleveland is fundamentally different than all championships in the past. The city of Cleveland had a long title drought (ignoring *Major League*), but MOST cities don't win championships. MOST franchises do not have a storied history of success. In a league with 30 teams, not everyone gets a trophy at the end of the year. Losing is the norm.
 
And that losing reputation can often change in a hurry. The New England Patriots didn't have much success as a franchise before Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. The Chicago Bulls didn't have much success before Michael Jordan. Golden State fans were booing their owner a few years before they became a dynasty. You're only a rotten franchise -- until you aren't.
 
I can see an argument that LeBron James' title in Cleveland should be given heavy bonus points if he built it organically. If he turned around a team on the bottom and lifted it to the title slowly but surely until they got over the hump (a la Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas, or alternate dimension Kevin Durant in OKC.)
 
But we have to remember what actually happened. LeBron James left Cleveland, and only returned when they won the NBA Draft lottery and the # 1 pick -- not once, not twice, but three times. As a result, they managed to have a roster with Kyrie Irving and picks that would translate into Kevin Love. We're talking about two All-Star caliber players who were both in their primes.
 
With Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and LeBron James, the deck was not stacked against the Cleveland Cavaliers. They were, by far, the favorite to come out of the Eastern Conference. Their team was title worthy, and would have won 2-3 championships if a Golden State super team didn't emerge out of nowhere.
 
To be fair, LeBron James' comments were not only about the drought, but also about that opponent. As he mentioned:
 
*""Everybody was just talking -- how [the Warriors] were the greatest team of all time, like it was the greatest team ever assembled. And for us to come back, you know, the way we came back in that fashion, I was like, ‘you did something special.*
 
Absolutely, I agree with James there. To beat a 73-win team was incredible, especially in the manner that they did it.
 
That said, I'd take a slight issue here. **Regular season win totals do not automatically equate to your greatness as a team.** We've seen time and time again (especially lately), that the playoffs are an entirely different animal. If season wins and point differential were the be-all and end-all, the Toronto Raptors would have multiple Finals appearances by now.
 
As the Kyle Lowry-DeMar DeRozan Raptors proved, some teams are better in the regular season, and some are better in the playoffs. LeBron James' teams (thanks to him) have routinely been better in the playoffs than the regular season.
 
The point here is that: *that* Warriors team (with Harrison Barnes) was not the greatest team ever assembled, nor playing that way in big games. They had previously won the title, but did that against an injury-riddled Cleveland team (that they still only beat 4-2.) They barely squeaked by Oklahoma City 4-3 to make the Finals. For whatever reason, those Golden State teams were better in the regular season than the playoffs. They were not an unstoppable force at all. The Cavs winning that series was an upset, but not wholly different than the times LeBron James got upset himself.
 
Meanwhile, the new Warriors are indeed a juggernaut. The Kevin Durant + Warriors teams had worse regular season records than the pre-KD Warriors, but have a higher ceiling and thus a more unbeatable aura when they turn on the gas in the playoffs. They have won 8 playoff series, and lost a total of 6 games while doing so (going 32-6.) They cut their playoff losses by more than half. If LeBron James' team had beaten *this* version of the Golden State Warriors, I'd acknowledge that it may be the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to the GOAT debate. But to me, the victory over the 73-win Golden State Warriors was -- while hugely impressively – does not lead James to surpass Michael Jordan.

It may happen one day. But not today. And not because of one title in Cleveland. He will need to keep that power button on and keep that motor running, because he still has more work to do.
 
**greatness but not beyond reproach**
 
I understand that someone who just wrote 1000+ words criticizing LeBron James may classify as a ""hater,"" but that's not my intention. I'm not a die-hard fan of any particular team or any particular player (hence the lack of flair.)
 
In fact, I happen to be a huge admirer of LeBron James as a human being. He handles his business (literally, his business) in exceptional fashion. He appears to be a great husband and father. He's a willing and engaged advocate for social and political change. He's doing all the right things. His heart is in the right place.
 
That said, that doesn't make him beyond criticism. I firmly believe that you can criticize your friends, your family members, or your favorite players when you happen to disagree with them. And in these two particular instances, I happen to disagree with James.",0.53,controversial,2019-01-01 16:23:31
214,[Unpopular Opinion] Curry/Kd/Harden in place of Lebron would have made the finals last year as well,6,ax8fdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ax8fdf/unpopular_opinion_currykdharden_in_place_of/,76,1551742679.0,"Some people believe that Lebron is still the best because of last year's playoff run. I've seen countless comments saying only he could have dragged them to the finals, Kd/curry would have lost in the 1st round against Indiana, etc. 

To me that's ridiculous. So you complain GSW ruined the league by being too stacked with 2 MVPs and 2 other stars, but then say those same MVPs would not be able to get past a Victor Oladipo-led team (who had multiple bad games in that series) or a Tatum/Horford led team? If lesser players such as Iverson, Kidd, and Dwight all were able to carry weak supporting casts out of the East, do you really think Curry or Kd couldn't? 

Toronto wouldn't be much of a problem seeing as how they always fold. Boston would be tough, but I don't understand why the same people who say the 2015 finals doesn't count because Kyrie and Love were injured, are saying winning the ECF is so legendary and impressive when Boston was also missing Kyrie and Hayward.

And honestly after seeing Harden carry a team of G-leaguers from 14th to 3rd seed, I think he could too. Yes he folded against the spurs in 17 and was not perfect in the 18 WCF but the spurs and warriors were both lightyears ahead of Indiana/Toronto/Boston in terms of talent, coaching and defensive schemes, which helped stifle him a bit.

Downvote me if you want, but I really think the claim that ""Lebron is the best because only he can carry bad teams to the finals"" is not true. I truly believe Kd or curry in place of Lebron on the cavs would have made the finals in 2018. Harden might not be as likely but still has an excellent chance, no way I see these 3 losing against Indiana or Toronto.",0.53,controversial,2019-03-04 15:37:59
215,The Hard Truth: Harden's movements explained.,785,8cpzm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8cpzm1/the_hard_truth_hardens_movements_explained/,542,1523933578.0,"Hey folks! :) the reason for making this is goes as follows:

&nbsp;

Yesterday a video was posted that garnered a lot of attention; I will withhold the users name out of respect but he claimed that, the move that Harden did against Andrew Wiggins, which he termed was ""a blatant travel becoming Harden's signature move"". So, naturally, I made me reply in defense of the move - which then wasn't received so nicely at the time.

&nbsp;

I understand what people might have been feeling, it's a playoff game - refs have been the bane of a few viewers, or - they just hate the fact that ""James Harden always travels and gets away with it"". Listen, I understand the frustration and it's all reasonable in one way or another.

&nbsp;

I want to note that, 1. I am **NOT** a Houston Rockets fan - nor am I **FAN** of James Harden. I like guy, he's good, but, for me, I'm a fan of the sport more-so than a team or a player. So hopefully, by you all taking some time to digest the following explanation - it will better help you understand Harden's dribble mechanic and his excellent use of footwork.


&nbsp;


I will now explain some common rules - this, by no means is to insult or degrade anyone reading; it's just to add some context and support behind my explanation.

&nbsp;

**Official NBA Rule Book:**

&nbsp;

**Section VII pg. 19: Pivot**

> A pivot takes place when a player, who is holding the ball, steps once or more than once in any direction with the same foot, with the other foot (pivot foot) in contact with the floor.

> If the player wishes to dribble after a pivot, the ball must be out of his hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor. If the player raises his pivot off the floor, he must pass or attempt a field goal before the foot is returned to the floor.

> If he fails to follow these guidelines, he has committed a traveling violation.

&nbsp;

**Section XIII pg. 37: Traveling**

> B. A player who comes to a stop on step one when both feet are on the floor or touch the floor simultaneously may pivot using either foot as his pivot. If he jumps with both feet he must release the ball before either foot touches the floor.

> H. Upon ending his dribble or gaining control of the ball, a player may not touch floor consecutively with the same foot (hop).


&nbsp;

There are about 15 separate rules that explain different types of ""travels""; that is not taking into consideration the plethora of rules that distinguish what dribbles are as well as other rules that may in-fact offset already set and established rules– I mean, it’s insane. I have a whole new perspective and respect for referees after just SKIMMING the rule book. Anyways, in this case, these two rules mentioned above are crucial and reflect the James Harden play, and if misunderstood incorrectly - would deem his move a travel.

&nbsp;

Also, shootout to /u/abumaju – I had to google the definition for “gather step”; not that I didn’t know what it was, but I couldn’t find it in the rule book – and he had a post from 2013 that explained why 3 steps were deemed “legal”.

&nbsp;

**Gather Step** - [You're allowed 2 steps upon completion of a dribble, so if you dribble while pushing off of one foot it is not counted toward one of your 2 allowed steps.]( https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1lyyr3/explanation_of_why_3_steps_is_actually_legal/)

&nbsp;

Alright, now that we have rules out of the way – lets discuss replays.

&nbsp;

This is a topic that’s very prevalent within the NFL – especially after BIG HITS. In the NFL, when you slow down a play it looks WAY more vicious than it does when actually watching it. This is a concern that I have with NFL fans calling every other slow-motion tackle a “dirty hit”. The game of football is fast paced, so when an action occurs it may or may not seem that big until you slow it down.

&nbsp;

THIS, however, is the opposite in basketball.

&nbsp;

Basketball is a fast-paced sport, and you have to take into account many different things, I mean, just look at the damn NBA Rulebook – would I want to be a ref after reading that thing? HELL NO!

&nbsp;

When you watch a play in live action, as opposed to football, the move may look illegal, because you can’t see everything that’s going on. Basketball players are so quick with their footwork that every other Harden euro-step, or Lebron James drive to the rim is called a foul. However, when you slow it down, it is THEN when you break down the play that you see what **actually** happened.

&nbsp;

Now, all of that aside, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of this ordeal.

&nbsp;

[This was the video that everyone was up in arms about – and, rightfully so.]( https://streamable.com/ikkia)

&nbsp;

/u/sims888 – hands down one of the best memers and contributors on the subreddit [sent me this picture asking if it was a gather step.]( https://imgur.com/40k2l8j)

&nbsp;

When woke up to that message and saw that picture, I was like “woah, okay, that looks really bad”, not because it was a genuine question. But because it appears Harden has both feet on the ground – and then he would have to take a few more steps to get behind the 3 point line to shoot the ball. Which, to anyone who would see that pic – would call his play a travel.

&nbsp;

**BREAKING DOWN THE PLAY**:

[James Harden activating the crossover on Andrew Wiggins]( https://imgur.com/hYK12ZR)
* Here we see Harden attempting what appears to be a crossover. His body is leaned forward, right leg extended and holding his position, while his left leg is jabbing towards the ground.

&nbsp;

[James Harden closing in]( https://imgur.com/qLUvxfp)
* What we see here, is Harden dribbling the ball, legally closing the distance – bringing his body closer together and placing tons of bodyweight on his left leg.

&nbsp; 

[James Harden beginning to activate his “signature move”]( https://imgur.com/Ku1m85k)
* Harden, still in the act of dribbling, sizes up Wiggins – slowly starting to use the energy he placed on his left leg with his body weight in the picture above.

&nbsp;

[Harden 7: Note: these movements are happening within SECONDS](https://imgur.com/aj8FKMM)

&nbsp;

Okay, so what is Harden doing here? He is using the force that he placed on his left leg and is now proceeding to take Wiggins off balance and create distance between the two.
[Within ONE SECOND Harden has a victim. Wiggins is off balance, he has no way to recover, so Harden is now beginning to release his left leg – to create distance](https://imgur.com/AeYevIQ)

&nbsp;

Okay, here is where we take a moment and admire Harden’s agile footwork, the whole play was derived from placing weight on that left leg – however, if you’re into boxing, you would know that your “jab leg” in this case is ALWAYS supported by the leg that is behind it; THAT is where your power comes from – and in this case, is what Harden used to not only create an impressive amount of distance – but do so – so quickly and fluidly that his left leg APPEARED to be on the ground but was only INCHES away from touching it. If this man was a boxer – he would be something else based off his ability to move so effortlessly on the court.

&nbsp;

[Harden’s back leg now raising, activating his calves, thighs, and glutes – his left leg is suspended in air, hence the shadow.](https://imgur.com/52D5zWj)

&nbsp;

Harden *“tip-toeing in his Adidas”* lol. I am not one to fan boy – but this man, within SECONDS, [has now created so much distance that Wiggins is out of frame, left leg in air – and appears to look as if he would jump to take the shot RIGHT THERE: which, he could.](https://imgur.com/VC7RFgi)

&nbsp;

Now, Hardens “first step” – or, his legal ability to take two steps after dribbling [came here]( https://imgur.com/18z9Txg)

&nbsp;

Harden now utilizes this and quickly bounces off his left leg, transferring moment and force and then…

&nbsp;

[Bam, both legs hit the ground and we all know what happens next](https://imgur.com/kYrGqhU)

&nbsp;

To conclude, Harden has amazing footwork, his awkward movements are his ace card – defenders don’t know how to guard it – which is why I’m sure people consider him one of the most ungaurdable players in the NBA today.

&nbsp;

I have to say, after breaking this down, I give so much respect to referees, because if it was any average joe nba fan officiating this game – they would have called this move a travel. 

&nbsp;

I can’t speak on other plays, because it took me so long to break down this one – but the guy moves in seconds, he knows the rules, all he is doing is exploiting defenders with his timing to create space for his shot. Hopefully this helped you understand the type of player Harden is; and to know that – not everything is as it seems; which is why breaking down film is extremely crucial in understanding a player and his movements. 

&nbsp;

Alas, I am not trying to convince anyone of anything, but help them realize what happened last night, and that the uproar for this move, justifiably so – to those that just saw it for what it was – was okay, but they were misguided by their eyes.

&nbsp;

I really wanted to make this a video but, oh well.. lol.. hope you guys enjoyed this, take care – for now. 😊

&nbsp;

Peace!

Thank you to u/uphere- for pointing this out. I will not delete any comments because at the time, that (above what I just posted via u/uphere- is what I was trying to explain to u/FIVE_DARRA_NO_HARRA was that anything after THAT was him gathering, and not a step, but I got confused due to flooded comments) 

&nbsp;


Anything other than his other foot moving behind the arch for the plant after his SECOND STEP BEHIND THE ARCH would be deemed a travel, him planting his OTHER foot behind the arch to then go for the jumper IS NOT A STEP.

216,Durant joining the Warriors would be the most Anti-Competitive thing I've ever seen. He and the team would instantly be hated for it.,0,4r5cao,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4r5cao/durant_joining_the_warriors_would_be_the_most/,132,1467632027.0,"You might have seen [this Durant tweet from 2010](https://twitter.com/kdtrey5/status/18688294600) in which Durant says:

>Now everybody wanna play for the heat and the Lakers? Let's go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!

Frankly, if Durant joins the Warriors it's 10x more anti-competitive than what LeBron did in 2010.   In 2010, the Heat were a 47 win team.  They gutted the roster to make room for LeBron and Bosh.  

Look, I know Michael Beasley didn't go on to much success, but at the time Beasley was a 21 year old who had been recently selected 2nd in the draft and had just come off a season averaging 14.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.3 assist.  The Heat flat out gave him away for a 2nd rounder just to make cap space to sign LeBron and Bosh.  

Consider the teams also ""in the running"" to land Durant this season.  The Boston Celtics are a 48 win team that theoretically could add Al Horford and Kevin Durant without sacrificing any significant pieces.  That's the equivalent of what LeBron did in Miami - joined a 47 win team with another all-star.  His method of doing it was undoubtedly annoying and classless, but what he actually did still had some semblance of competitive spirit.  

On the flip side, Durant joining Golden State this Summer would be one of the most disgraceful things I've ever seen in competitive sports.  They came inches away from being back-to-back champions.  They arguably had the greatest offense we've ever seen.  They are coming off a record-breaking 73 win regular season and came mere seconds away from having a legitimate claim as the greatest team of all-time.  Game 7 was fucking tied with a minute left.  The game was essentially decided by a single FG.

Durant joining a world-beating 73 win team would be the ultimate spineless move.  Steph, Draymond and Clay are all in their 20s and all three of them were All-NBA players this years.  Not to mention, this is the team that just defeated Durant in the playoffs. 

Do not dare compare this to what LeBron did in Miami.  It's not even remotely close.  This would be like if in 2008 after narrowly losing to KG/Pierce/Ray's 66 win Celtics in game 7, LeBron decided to sign with them in the offseason - but only if the aging KG, Pierce and Ray had all been in their mid 20s, in the thick of their prime and a 73 win record-setting team.  

Also, in terms of his legacy, I don't see how this will really benefit him.  Steph is the reigning MVP of the entire league.  Any championships they win will just be adding to Steph's resume.  Wade was a step past his prime by the time LeBron showed up - it was pretty clear LeBron was the main guy there immediately.   That's unlikely to be the case on Golden State.  Really, the only place that team has to go is down.  They are unlikely to win more than 73 games next season even with Durant.  Even if they win the championship, how much credit can Durant really get for it?  

In order for Durant to get credit, Steph and Klay would need to suddenly evolve into side-kicks, Durant would need to lead the team in multiple statistical categories, they'd need to win 80 regular season games and sweep through the playoffs - with Durant winning Finals MVP in the process.  Anything less than that?  He's an anti-competitive bandwagoner.   

I live in Seattle and saw Durant's first home game in person.  I've been rooting for him for a long time.  If he joins the Warriors, I'll lose a lot of respect for him.  Meanwhile, Golden State has been an exceptionally likeable team for two seasons.  I've been rooting for Steph Curry since he was a rookie.  I have an affinity for shooters.  I use to argue with fans about how Monta Ellis was holding back Curry and the kid could be a superstar.   I love that guy...   If Durant joins that team, the Warriors instantly become the league-wide villains.  They become the ""evil empire"".  They become a negative symbol for everyone outside of Golden State.   I can't be alone in this.  Many would see Durant as an anti-competitive puss.   

The irony is that this is possibly the one scenario that could turn previously-despised LeBron James in to an underdog hero.  I can't imagine rooting for that bushleague Golden State team if they clashed with 32 year old LeBron in the Finals.   If LeBron succeeded in defeating them - the act alone would make him arguably the greatest athlete in history.   THAT is how you build a legacy.  

**TL;DR:  Durant joining Golden State would make him the biggest anti-competitive bitch in history.  Fan opinion would instantly turn against both him and that team.  It would be terrible for his legacy.  If they stayed on top, he'd get little credit for it.  If all he cares about is helping another star collect jewelry, he might as well take the league minimum and go help LeBron win another championship**",0.45,controversial,2016-07-04 04:33:47
217,The Suns will not be the worst team in the West,0,caz0ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/caz0ho/the_suns_will_not_be_the_worst_team_in_the_west/,84,1562696341.0,"Bookmark this now.

&#x200B;

Three years ago the organization decided to embrace the tank and commit to fully rebuilding and building through the draft to accumulate the talent for the next great Suns team.

We on purpose put together extremely young teams with the intention to give young players a chance to develop with playing time while also guaranteeing a high draft pick. The last 2 years r/nba fans and casual Suns fans cried about acquiring any PG but the Suns resisted doing something stupid like trading first round picks for Terry Rozier or making other short-term moves to adress glaring issues.

&#x200B;

**We played the whole season last year without a PG.** 

Canaan was a D-League scrub who brought positive attitude and played hard but has no idea how to run an offense and by metrics was one of the worst players in the league.

Melton flashed defensive potential occasionally but he is 2nd round project that had no idea how to play offense and overall was not good on defense at all. At one point later in the season Booker was so frustrated with Melton that he yelled at Igor during the game to ""put his ass on the bench"".

Okobo also only showed flashes but was far away from being even a serviceable backup.

&#x200B;

**We played the whole last year without a PF.**

Ariza was slacking. Bender got a whole lot of minutes at PF without ever earning them and consistently being one of the worst 10 players in the league since being drafted. So we often played small forwards at PF that were nowhere near ready to hold their own against power forwards.

&#x200B;

**We kept playing ""low floor - high potential"" scrubs major minutes hoping for it to click since we had nothing to lose.**

We kept giving major minutes to Josh Jackson hoping it would finally click for him despite him being one of the worst 10 players in the league and he gave us nothing but occasional flashes. His boneheaded decision making cost us several possessions per game just by himself. Anyone who follows the NBA knows how killer it is to have two completely unnecessary turnovers, charges or running into low percentage layups or getting blocked.

Josh Jackson got his layups blocked at least once per game.

Many people always described him as a defender, but he was absolutely awful at actually playing defense and consistently lost his man.

One of the biggest flaw is that players like Josh Jackson played like they were trying to be the next Tracy McGrady but the Suns do not even have room for that. We already have our star players in Ayton and Booker. We can't afford a 20 year old out there trying to go from scrub to star. We needed players who accept their role as role players first of all and do that job first.

&#x200B;

**We had a coach whose system was completely opposed to the strength of the players he was working with.**

Igor was a horrendous coach. Even though he initially claimed to build a system around his players he had set targets for assists and 3pt attempts per game. Despite the Suns being the worst 3pt shooting teams in the NBA he had us shooting a high volume of 3s.

Despite not having a PG he tried to play fast. A young team like that playing fast without a PG is a recipe for disaster when you have players like Jackson who totally kill many possessions. If you run up the total possessions per game the difference between the mistakes a young team makes compared to more veteran solid teams just grows larger and makes it more likely to lose.

&#x200B;

**Losing TJ Warren is unlikely to have much of an effect.**

He was a constant in our worst performing 5-man units. He didn't fit in at all. He does not move the ball. While he is a good slasher off the ball it still never felt like he actually moves off the ball. He miraculously raised his 3pt% but it was still on a low volume and he still never looked like a natural shooter.

He struggled on defense. He was hopeless in playing the 4 defensively.

He constantly injured himself with concussions or other undisclosed mystery injuries.

I can't recount how often he made myself pull my hair out when he committed charging fouls or took low percentage shots when he had an obvious open pass to make.

538 rated him as a scrub. While I personally don't believe that I think his skillset fills a niche that simply was not there on the Suns. We need 3&D players to surround Booker, Ayton and now Rubio. If we kept Warren he was going to get stuck behind Bridges and Oubre.

&#x200B;

**This offseason things have been different.**

&#x200B;

**Addition by Substraction**

James Jones cut away all the negative players. Jackson, Melton and Bender are gone 

&#x200B;

**The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs way**

We brought in a lot of young vets that are maybe not sexy but solid players who can be expected to play hard and do their job.

In the draft James Jones went for 2 players who are expected to be more mature and have well-defined NBA skillsets instead of swinging for the fences with another low floor high ceiling 19 year old who is struggling to find his way. Also he constructed the roster in a way that rookies are not going to be counted on to be rotation players from the start.

Every year you look at the Spurs and Heat roster and you think wow that is a collection of some uninspiring players but most of the time even if you think they have little talent on the roster they end up playing hard and solid and beat teams that seemingly have talent but are inconsistent, immature or whatever.

&#x200B;

**Positional Upgrades and closing gaping holes in the roster**

We upgraded from Richaun Holmes to Aron Baynes. Holmes was nice surprise for the Suns but struggled on the boards and defensively. Baynes is expected to bring more toughness, defense and mentality to the team.

I am not a fan of Saric or Kaminsky but it certainly is a huge upgrade over playing Dragan Bender at the 4 and having nobody else. 

&#x200B;

**Carrying over the attitude shift**

Tyler Johnson and Kelly Oubre made an impact last season already. When everyone was healthy we actually saw improvements already. Tyler Johnson is a solid player, solid defender who plays hard. Kelly Oubre brought a lot to the team as well in terms of mentality and attitude and playing hard.

&#x200B;

**The Young Core - Improvements from Within**

Mikal Bridges had a great rookie season that nobody is talking about. He was as a rookie rated one of the absolute best perimeter defenders in the entire league already.

Booker has gotten better every year in the league. Last year he came into the season with a hand injury and turf toe. Toward the end of the year he was noticeably more explosive, frequently dunking which he did not do much before.

Ayton had a great rookie season and actually was first in most of the advanced stats. He is due to make significant improvement.

Oubre should also be mentioned here.

&#x200B;

**To have a PG or not to have a PG**

Ricky Rubio - while I am not a huge fan of his you can't deny that he will have a huge effect on the Suns. We had no PG last year. There is plenty of precedence for huge W/L improvements that are tied to the acquisition of a PG or improvement at the PG position. Just look at the Kings last year, before the season pretty much nobody thought they had more talent than the Suns but Fox got a lot better and suddenly the Kings performed a lot better despite on paper having less talent. There are plenty examples like Steve Nash signing with the Suns, Kidd to the Nets are probably a lot more where PGs  made significant impacts. While Rubio is not of that caliber going from Canaan to Rubio is probably a more drastic difference than going from Marbury to Nash or from Marbury to Kidd.

As a result Ayton should get more consistent touches.

Booker does not have to bring up the ball all the time and play against elite ball pressure all the time. Last year teams often double teamed him as soon as he crossed half court, some pressured him all the way which sometimes frustrated him and exhausted him.

Hopefully Rubio's passing is contagious. Ayton already showed elite passing ability for a center. Saric is as good a passer as almost any PF. Booker is a good passer. Bridges showed glimpses of passing ability. Hopefully Oubre can develop that part of his game.

&#x200B;

**Potential for Trade Deadline Moves**

This year it is likely that James Jones could commit if a really good player becomes available. The Suns have a huge expiring contract in Tyler Johnson and all their future first round picks to further upgrade the roster if they are somewhat close to the 8th seed.

&#x200B;

**Lineups on Paper**

If you rank the NBA starting lineups by WAR(Wins Above Replacement) the new Suns starting lineup actually ranks 17th in the entire league and that stat probably underestimates them still since they have been on bad or even bad dysfunctional teams.

&#x200B;

Ayton / Baynes

Saric / Kaminsky

We probably won't run a 10 man rotation. Kaminsky will see minutes at the 4 and 5. Bridges will get minutes at the 2 and 3. Oubre will get minutes at the 3 and 4. Booker will get minutes at the 2 and 1. Tyler Johnson is going to get minutes at the 2 and 1.

Ayton might even see some minutes as the 4 as he played very well against Giannis and Lebron when he was matched up against them defensively all game. In fact if Ayton and Kaminsky share the floor my expectation would be that Ayton covers the 4 and Kaminsky the 5.

**Important to start off on the right foot and create momentum**

Can they click from the start? This would be important to create excitement in a sleeping fan base.

Chemistry with each other and with the coachin staff could determine their season.

&#x200B;

**The competition**

Everyone talks about how tough the West is but the bottom line is that all Western teams have to play basically the same schedule.

Memphis looks like it will be in the situation that the Suns were the last 3 years where they fully commit to the rebuild and will be playing guys like Josh Jackson. Same could happen in Oklahoma.

The Mavs have a similiar makeup as the Suns with their duo and some solid pieces around them. But I don't think you can look at their roster on paper and think they have a better roster.

The Pelicans are young and will be relying on young players a lot.

The Timberwolves don't look too hot after losing several rotation players in Derrick Rose, Saric and potentially Jones.

The Spurs are probably going to be very solid but they are not a lock like Golden State, Houston, LAC, Portland, Utah, Denver and the Lakers. 

The Spurs are the favorites for the 8th seed but any of the rest of the field except Memphis could have a breakout year and take it from them.

&#x200B;

Tier 1: Golden State, LA Clippers, Houston

Tier 2: Portland, Denver, Lakers, Utah

Tier 3: San Antonio

Tier 4: Phoenix, Dallas, New Orleans, Sacramento, Minnesota, OKC

Tier 5: Memphis

&#x200B;

**Some teams are bound to fall below expectations**

It is possible that Utah never gels with the changes they made. The players they brought in (Conley and Bojan) take a lot more shots than the players they let go (Rubio and Favors). Conley and Mitchell would join a long list of high usage backcourts that never worked out.

It is possible that the Lakers have a similar season to last year.

The Kings might find it hard to sustain their improvement from last year.

Minnesota might fall apart completely.

New Orleans looks like a wild card - why? They rely a lot on young players, a lot of young players who came into the league expecting to be star players. I predict struggles for them getting these guys to gel and buy into their roles.",0.5,controversial,2019-07-09 11:19:01
218,If the Lakers aren't careful they're going to turn into another pre-ASB 2018 Cavs situation,0,c9y3rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c9y3rp/if_the_lakers_arent_careful_theyre_going_to_turn/,50,1562473009.0,"In 2018 the Cavs started the season with Rose, Wade, LeBron, and Crowder sharing the court together and Kevin Love starting at center. These weren't awful players per se, several of them found success after moving on from the Cavs, but their team had no vision and their skillsets made 0 sense together. They had no clearly defined strengths and started the year as one of the worst offensive and defensive teams in the league. They tried experimenting with lineups (even testing out third stringers like Jose Calderon and Channing Frye) for a few months but eventually decided the damage was already done, gave up, and shipped everyone out at the all star break in a last ditch effort to save the season.

I feel like we're starting to see a similar pattern with the Lakers' last couple signings. I liked the Cook and Green signings but Rondo is fools gold. He still appears to be a good player but every year since he left the Celtics he's been a net negative on the floor. You can't have a ball dominant point guard that plays no defense and ruins spacing. Starting him with LeBron and Cousins is a potentially disastrous combination and I'm genuinely afraid that Rondo will get the nod over Cook/Caruso because of ""experience"" and name recognition. We already know how bad of a fit he is with LeBron. For reference:

LeBron + Caruso lineups: +9.1 in 147 minutes

LeBron + Rondo lineups: -5.4 in 602 minutes

Then there's Cousins. Now unlike Rondo I don't think Cousins is a terrible player but I do think he's going to severely limit the potential of an AD + LeBron combo assuming he starts. What the Lakers should be doing is starting AD at the 5 and centering their offense around the LeBron/Davis PnR. Simply surrounding them with shooting at every position and one more versatile wing defender would result in a devastating offensive team and a pretty solid defensive one. Starting Cousins could screw that all up. He still has a place on the team but it would be best to keep him out of the starting lineup in favor of more shooting. You can't expect for Danny Green to uphold the spacing on his own.

Now with all this said, based on sheer talent alone there's almost no chance that they'll be as bad as that Cavs team unless Rondo starts (I'm only half joking). I just think they're limiting the insane potential of a LeBron/AD PnR in favor of signing household names and it could cost them a championship.",0.49,controversial,2019-07-06 21:16:49

Here, we will take a look at Enes Kanter's performance in the regular season vs. the playoffs, during years in which his teams made the playoffs. (2012, 2016, 2017) **For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that Enes Kanter's nipples are soft outside of playoff basketball. Enes must obviously get aroused during big moments and during the weeks leading up to the playoffs, but this makes it easier to approximate the relationship between hardness and performance.**

##SOFT ENES (reg. season stats/36):

**19.5 PTS**/**12.2 REB**/**0.9 AST**/**0.7 STL**/0.8 BLK/2.5 TOV/**3.6 PF**/**53.9 FG%**/54.8 2PT%/**20.3 3PT%**/**58.3 TS%**

##HARD ENES (playoff stats/36):

18.2 PTS/11.9 REB/0.6 AST/0.4 STL/**1.7 BLK**/**2.0 TOV**/4.8 PF/51.3 FG%/54.8 2PT%/14.3 3PT%/57.1 TS%



Using these advanced statistics, I conclude that Soft Enes is easily better than Hard Enes, being ahead in almost every meaningful statistical category. The only real advantage Hard Enes holds is accumulating over twice as many blocks, which clearly shows that Enes Kanter's platonic arousal invigorates him and his animal instincts fuel him to become a defensive menace in the paint.

**10 Highlights**

This last week Dennis Schroder shot 15-50 and did not make a single 3 pointer in 3 games. He was absolutely shut down vs John Wall. He is going to be a great player and has a shit team around him but still consistency would be nice.

Tyreke Evans has scored at least 20 points every game in November. He is the only reason the Grizzlies are fun to watch right now, and he enters the top 100 for the first time this season. On that note, Mike Conley is free falling. It sucks that I have him this low but he is not playing well at all, and shot 2-12 tonight.

Ben Simmons is the best rookie since LeBron and I would argue as a rookie he is even better.

The Pistons have 3 top 50 players right now and it is well deserved. Getting Avery Bradley has completely changed this team around and Andre Drummond has finally taken the next step (so far).

Kyle Korver basically got himself in tonight with his 4th quarter against the Knicks. Don't know if he keeps it up for the season but the Cavs sure as hell need him right now.

I had Draymond 7th last week and I'm keeping him there. Stats don't tell the whole story with him, I've watched him more and I feel comfortable keeping him there for now but that's his ceiling too.

I will release my top 25 rookies Friday night, but my top 10 right now is Simmons, Tatum, Ball, Kuzma, Markkaken, Collins, Fox, Mitchell, Smith, Brooks

Paul George has scored 79 points the last 2 games. If Westbrook can play at the MVP level he was last year then OKC can take off. 

Kyle Lowry isn't scoring as much as he did last year and has probably declined a bit but he's still a very good player that makes winning plays. 

This is probably as high as Gortat will get this year, but I think his ranking is well deserved right now. I've watched a few Wizards games and I guarantee you take him out of the lineup and things will be off right away.

225,People Hate James Harden,0,ba5v5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ba5v5u/people_hate_james_harden/,112,1554595833.0,"&#x200B;

It’s the simplest way to explain the events of the past few years. The loss to Curry in 2015 was understandable. The two players had very similar stats, but Steph had served as the offensive engine of a 67-win Warriors team that surprised everyone after a coaching change. Harden did not have the help of a stellar supporting cast led by 2 All-star teammates, the closest approximation, Dwight Howard, missed half the games to injury, but Harden managed to pull a rag-tag bunch of role players featuring Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley and Donatas Motiejunas to the third seed in a very competitive Western Conference by posting a statline of 27.4/5.7/7. In the end, the historic nature of 67 wins and the unknown promise of unplayed fourth quarters denied Harden an MVP despite his shouldering the larger load.

That was understandable. 

Every thing since then is less defensible.

The following season was the last of the Howard years and was defined by an extreme loss of chemistry (despite being the one time in team history that Daryl Morey did not make major rotation changes due to the WCF run… aside from the acquisition of Ty Lawson), the quick hook of McHale, the total inability of JB Bickerstaff to get buy-in from the team, and a defensive video compilation of Harden’s career lowlights. Despite the team difficulties, Harden still showed improvement in his individual stats across the board. While leading the NBA in points and minutes (through 82 games), he posted an incredible 29/6/7.5 statline that had only ever been accomplished by LeBron, MJ, and Oscar Robertson. Unfortunately, due to team turmoil, it led to a disappointing 8th seed. The failure to live up to expectations surely played a role, but the resulting snub from even 3rd String All-NBA was a major statement from voters that they just didn't care for something about James Harden. Lillard, Lowry, and Thompson were all awarded selections despite having statistically inferior seasons by huge margins.

The next season was even worse. Harden set an NBA record for points created, surpassing the totals of Tiny Archibald. Yes. He produced more points for his team in one season *THAN ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA*. Yet the historic feat that everyone remembers from that season was Russell Westbrook’s assault on Wilt’s triple double record and being the first player since the Big O to average one for a season. 

Be honest, now… Did you remember (or even know) that Harden was the NBA record holder for points created? Maybe, maybe not… but the media certainly didn't help bring it to your attention. There was no tracking of it every night on Sportscenter, or graphic in the sidebar, leaving people like myself to scroll through play-by-plays every night to verify how many assists resulted in three points as opposed to two. 

It wasn’t like the record caught anyone off-guard. Harden had been comfortably ahead of pace for most of the season before a late injury-induced swoon made it an incredibly tight finish. You should have paid attention to those last few games as the questions started to arise of if he could actually pull it off as his season averages dipped significantly. It was a really exciting moment. But not a single news outlet paid it a bit of attention aside from TheDreamShake blog - the same people that revealed the early MVP voting results that year by compiling all the voters picks they could get until a large enough majority had been established to safely project the winner (much to the chagrin of the NBA, who attempted to foil it before it spoiled the crown jewel of their new post-Finals awards show).

There was no good reason for the media blackout. They just didn’t want to focus any attention on the pursuit of the record.

Oh well, no big deal. It's not like he was in the middle of an MVP race and they were fawning all over his competition. Wait... No... That’s actually *exactly* what happened. The media literally created a narrative around the significance of the triple double while ignoring **the most prolific offensive season ever**.

And that was simply the prelude to the greatest disrespect of all. Despite winning 55 games and leading his team to the third seed with great efficiency, voters gave the MVP to a guy who led his team to the *10th best record* in the NBA. A meager 6th seed in the playoff bracket. 3 spots lower (in both cases) than the previously lowest MVP finish (In 1988 by one Michael Jeffery Jordan 35/5.5/5.9) from the past 40 years of media voting. 

This complete break in voting standards was utterly unprecedented, but Westbrook’s accomplishment was deemed “historically significant” as it hadn't been done in over 50 years. If you aren't drawing the connections to this year yet, stick around and I’ll point them out.

Last year was finally Harden’s redemption, though, as he finally won the MVP that had twice eluded him. His case was inscrutable. League scoring leader leading his team through injuries to the number one seed and 65 wins with historic point differentials. There was nobody in the Association even coming close to accomplishing what he was doing. But could the sports media bring themselves to simply acknowledge his greatness and the inevitability of his victory? No. Perennial “should-have-been-a-contender” LeBron James was forced into the conversation again after having disappeared from everyone’s radar for the past few seasons. After leading his team through a turbulent year of roster mayhem to the 6th best record in the league, LeBron really had zero place in the conversation aside from ‘being owed one’ for remaining the best player in the league for the past 4 years. Yet there he was, in a supposedly tight MVP race.

Yes, the media was suggesting that 2018 should be the year to give ‘Bron his 5thMVP almost as a form of ‘lifetime achievement’ award instead of honoring Harden’s accomplishments. The narrative was pushed hard in order to create a semblance of a race and avoid an early coronation where pundits could just appreciate the season as it was unfolding. In 2016 there were no qualms with simply appreciating the greatness of what Steph was doing... but when Harden was doing similar things it was time to consider a different James for top individual honors. 

This year Harden has finally seen some appreciation. It only took setting a record of the **only 35-point, 7-assist season in history**, punctuated with the only 40-point monthly average since Wilt and the second longest streak of 30-point games for the pundits to sit up and take notice. It took the most efficient high volume scoring season (over 32 ppg) resulting in breaking MJ’s 1987 record for point per possession to get a little bit of love from some of the press. 

By any standard, Harden is doing historic things. And he has done it efficiently under a tremendous usage rate that was absolutely required of him due to a heavily injured roster. And it has led to winning results as his team is challenging for the 4th best record in the league despite sitting in second-to-last place after a lackluster first couple of months. The narrative is practically too strong to be denied when compared to the one that beat Harden just two years ago. But here we are again, watching the media try desperately to ignore the history and anoint a 24-year old Greek kid who helped an excellently coached and very healthy squad to a 60-win season through an historically weak schedule.

Don’t get me wrong, Giannis has been a remarkable and integral player in his team’s success, but his only significant advantage beyond a better team record is his DPotY-caliber defense… a criteria that has historically been given short shrift in MVP discussions. 

Harden delivered one of the best offensive seasons in history. Because his team absolutely needed him to in order to win. 

And yet still the haters abound. Scoffing at his ability to draw free throws, insulting his playing style as “boring”, “against the spirit of the game”, or even “cheating”. Harping on his much improved defense, and claiming that any number of players “could do the same thing”.

Why do people love to hate James Harden?

This was the largest difference for an MVP in ppg between the regular season and postseason since Moses Malone's 1981-1982 season(7 ppg difference). Moses Malone only played 3 games during the playoffs so it is possible to go back farther than that since that's not exactly a great sample size. 

I just thought this was an interesting factoid.  A lot of people reference Curry's 2016 season as the greatest offensive season of all time. As a season is comprised of both a regular season and postseason, I personally don't feel like I can place that season as the greatest of all time in its totality. I do believe it's one of the top 2-3 offensive regular seasons of all time though.

When the Pacers looked like they would win 70 games, they rebounded at 52.8%.  And when they started to fall apart after the All Star break, they rebounded at...53%.  Their lowest total, 50.8% (I don't think April is a large enough sample size - and their April hasn't been as bad as march) would be top 12 - over the Spurs and Clippers

And, speaking of the Clips, everyone slams Roy for his rebounding while DeAndre is gobbling up boards.  Jordan has taken a huge step this year, and good for him.  But the Clippers *average* a 49.7% rebound rate, below league average.

If Hibbert really sucked at rebounding, his team should give up more than their share of rebounds.  They don't.

Now, in fairness, Hibbert's personal rebounding % nosedived in March, although it was pretty consistent the rest of the year.  This fits what we all knew:  Hibbert, like the rest of the team, had a shitty spring.  But the idea that he sucks because he doesn't get REB on the stat sheet is utterly obtuse.  

The Pacers send any dribble-drives towards Hibbert, who uses his superhuman verticality to contest things.  This means he is facing the wrong direction, arms up.  Good for defense, not for rebounding.  

The real reason why the Pacers have tanked is their offense efficiency has plummeted.  That puts a ton of pressure on the defense, which may have regressed after a historically good start. 


And, while we're at it - one thing that I noticed is the Pacer's drop in pace has mirrored their slump.  If you want the Pacers to run, you don't want Roy grabbing a monster share of the boards.  PG, Lance, George Hill, 2nd Overall Pick Evan Turner (now I'm a sad 76ers fan again) are all good rebounders.  Hibbert is not known for his outlet passing and his handle is...exactly what you'd expect.  If you want to push the pace, would you want Hibbert boarding and tossing to George Hill?  Or just skip the potential problems (steal, bad pass, time wasted) and have a guard grab it?  In fact, if Hibbert read this nonsense and decided to up his rebounds, he could very well hurt the team.  

TLDR; Pacers have problems. Roy Hibbert's rebounding is not one of them.",0.52,controversial,2014-04-14 02:12:19
228,They haven't played a single game and I already hate the Brooklyn Nets,0,10uegm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10uegm/they_havent_played_a_single_game_and_i_already/,71,1349249120.0,"**Upvote or downvote all you want, just please add your own opinion to the comments. I'd like discussion and debate.**

I just can't stand the whole philosophy behind the whole thing. First they move to Brooklyn, which really isn't a big deal seeing as they used to be in NYC anyways, but they come in as cocky as ever, ""claiming"" the city as their own.

Second off they aren't even going to be all that. They're a 4 seed at best, and it's the Eastern Conference. Everyone knew without Dwight they would all be a bunch of spare pieces to the puzzle, but they just won't admit it. They keep stating that they will win a championship in the next three years or something. Please.

Third - I saw a thread a few days ago where a redditor said the Nets were a label, not a team - I couldn't agree more. Most of the people who buy this Nets merch I bet don't even care about the team that much. Yeah the logo looked cool for like a month. Now everyone's flaunting it everywhere. It doesn't help that whenever I see Kris Humphries I see a dumb celeb and not a basketball player.

Granted, there are some players on the team that I like (see - Everyone but Humphries), but they aren't even in the middle of all the hype going around this goddamn team. I haven't heard a single thing about Deron since he secured his place in Brooklyn, or any of the other players for that matter. All I hear is hype. Not ""Oh Deron is working out and really getting fit"" or ""Joe Johnson is determined to work hard this season"" No. Just Prokhorov and Jay-Z being as arrogant as possible.

I honestly can't wait to see them play at MSG for the first time and get whooped. I'm not saying that will definitely happen but I am sure that the start of the season will be very VERY anti-climactic.

I know I reiterated some points a lot but I just kinda slammed this all out.

So what do you think? Nets fans, what do you have in defense?",0.5,controversial,2012-10-03 00:25:20

230,"Kevin Durant is averaging 19.6 irrelevant PPG in the playoffs, wasting away on the Warriors and making the playoffs inefficient",44,68ynr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/68ynr6/kevin_durant_is_averaging_196_irrelevant_ppg_in/,216,1493821064.0,"He's given up any and all responsibility to affect games in a crucial way. I think this bothers me so much because the playoffs are 200x more interesting if he played for any other playoff team remaining (aside from Cleveland). 

1.) Houston with KD: I can't wait for the conference finals, Harden and KD vs the all time great Warriors. 

2.) Toronto with KD: Cleveland's big 3 vs Toronto's big 3. Sign me up, LeBron's eastern dominance might be over 

3.) Washington with KD: Wall, Beal, and Durant. Now the east has two great offensive teams and we might get 140 any given night 

4.) San Antonio with KD: Kawhi and Kevin ? Houston would be in a dogfight 

5.) Utah with KD: Hayward slides to your number 2 option and Golden State has a hell of a series on their hands 

6.) Boston with KD: IT and KD. Say no more. Add that to their deep wing rotation and I smell a Finals trip after a 7 game series with the Cavs

Instead, KD would rather just play the role of DJ Khaled, screaming his ad libs on hit songs, instead of doing the heavy lifting. 

These playoffs in general, aside from the Boston Washington series, has yet to give us a fascinating display. 

Let's say that we had a hypothetical market called the ""entertainment market"". It's currently inefficient. We're just not getting the most the playoffs can offer. Redistributing Kevin Durant's wasted potential would move that market towards equilibrium",0.54,controversial,2017-05-03 07:17:44
231,Chris Paul is a better player than John Stockton.,52,hlty74,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hlty74/chris_paul_is_a_better_player_than_john_stockton/,228,1594010984.0,"**Stockton**: 11 All-NBA (2/6/3); 5 All-Defense (0/5); 0.161 MVP shares; 13/10.5/2.7/2.2 career averages in 32 minutes per game; 60.8% career efficiency on 9 FGA per game. Lead league in steals twice and in assists nine times (consecutively). In the playoffs, he averaged 13.4/10.1/3.3/1.9 on 56.8% efficiency in 35 minutes per game. For playoff career “advanced” metrics, he has a PER of 19.8, WS/48 of 0.16, and BPM of 4.1.

**Paul**: 8 All-NBA (4/3/1); 9 All-Defense (7/2); 1.64 MVP shares; 18.5/9.7/4.5/2.2 current career averages in 35 minutes per game; 58% (current) career efficiency on 14 FGA per game.

The only real argument Stockton has *as a player* over Chris Paul is his longevity. That is it. And hey, fifty percent more games is massive. But Chris Paul is straight-up and pretty obviously better on a game to game basis.

However, the media, the fans, and a lot of people make such a big deal about the Warriors “superteams” in 2017-2019 when they literally drafted three of their main guys and made a good FA signing with KD and added a washed up Cousins. Meanwhile, LeBron came to the Lakers and recruited AD who came and now they’re trying to get Kawhi or Butler or whoever. Yet it’s ok, because it’s LeBron and he is the Golden Boy. Would fans feel the same way about the Lakers superteam as the Warriors’? I just don’t understand the double standard.",0.48,controversial,2019-06-27 21:23:26
233,"Contrary opinion: B/R were right to rank Middleton above Westbrook this year.

Russ is not some otherworldly floor general like CP3 that you could say his playmaking makes up for vastly worse efficiency on offense, not to mention Middleton is a better defender. 

We're talking about 2020, not their entire career, and this year Middleton was better. There weren't any serious arguments why Russ is *clearly* better, just a barrage of downvotes to anyone disagreeing.

-----------------------

edit: I don't agree (or care) about B/R's specific # rankings, just that I disagree that Westbrook is clearly better than Middleton. There's no point telling me ""He's not X places better than Westbrook"" or ""He's not a top-15 player"" because that's not what I argue.

Anyone that knows basketball knows how good AD is and he’s set to be there for a long long time. After Lebron is gone,  stars will want to come play with him the way they he did with Lebron.

2)  Months now people were thrashing these exact Lakers young guys. You can just look through many Pelican guys constantly tweeting about Lonzo’s attitude/Ingram’s shooting + RFA/ assets being thrash and way worse than Celtics/Clippers and even Knicks. How does that change now that they’re traded?

3) It’s a better deal than the deadline biggest reason being they didn’t take Hills contract but also kept Kuzma. Now they can chase a 3rd max guy or have space to sign some great role players 

4) Future picks will be late 1st rounders and he pick swap is meaningless if as expected Lakers finish above New Orleans. 

5) Win-Win for both teams. Pelicans bring young talent to grow around Zion which they didn’t do with AD. Lakers get AD and should win next year and probable favourites the year after too but they’re in contention every year that Lebron is here. One championship is worth the whole trade.

Nearly Christmas time, here is my updated list of the top 100 players in the NBA + the next 75

Per feedback, I decided to spread it out a little bit as my last update was 17 days ago. Which means there are some big changes.

Here is the list:

&#x200B;

|Player|Change from 17 days ago|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. LeBron James|same|LeBron keeps his number 1 spot, putting up 28/8/7 averages at nearly 34 years old is ridiculous. |
|2. James Harden |\+5|This might be a controversial ranking, and he's a controversial player on this sub. Statistically and efficiently, he's doing better than his MVP season last year now. His game is unique, it's caused a lot of discussion, and despite the team's issues he's been stellar and moves up to number 2.|
|3. Giannis Antetokounmpo|same|Shooting 59% from the field with 27/13/6 averages, unstoppable in the paint, a top 3 player.|
|4. Kevin Durant|\-2|KD was my number 1 player at the end of last year and remains in the top 5. Career high in assists per game, shooting efficiency is down from last year but he's still a top 5 player.|
|5. Nikola Jokic|\+5|His shooting efficiency is actually down from last year. But he's taking a more assertive role on offense, 7.4 APG, the Nuggets are winning, and improved defense. He's in the top 5.|
|6. Paul George|\+6|The thread ""is Paul George better than Westbrook"" has come up every day the last week. It looks like he's at his peak right now, 43 points last night, and he's in the top 6.|
|7. Kawhi Leonard|\-3|We'll see if he stays in Toronto, but he's been clutch with 26/9 averages as well as consistent. Good year so far.|
|8. Stephen Curry|\+1|His shooting efficiency is actually on pace to be a career best. He came back from injury and he's kept himself in the top 10, just the few players ahead of him have somehow played even more ridiculous. I think he'll move back up.|
|9. Anthony Davis|\-4|Career high 5 APG a game with improved defense, but the AD to LA talk is heating up and the Pelicans kind of need to get some stuff together. Either way still a bonafide top 10 player.|
|10. Russell Westbrook|\-2|Averaging a triple double for the 3rd straight season but Paul George is the one shining. That speaks volumes to the good situation OKC has. Could they compete with Golden State? We'll see.|
|11. Joel Embiid|\-5|26/13/4 averages, it's been a..somewhat quiet month for his standards but Philly is successful and he's been consistent.|
|12. Kyrie Irving|\+1|Max Kellerman: the Celtics are NOT better off without Kyrie Irving|
|13. Blake Griffin|\-2|26/9/5 averages and putting the hecklers in their place.|
|14. DeMar DeRozan|\+3|He's played well in the Spurs system and the team is back in the top 8 seeds.|
|15. Damian Lillard|same|The West is a bloodbath, but 2 months in Portland is sitting at a 5 seed and Lillard is having a career season low key.|
|16. Kyle Lowry|same|Has been kind of injured, but with 14/10 averages for the best team in the NBA he gets his respect.|
|17. Jimmy Butler|\-3|His impact on the 76ers has been clear, the team is sitting at a 3 seed and he's shooting the most efficient he ever has with them.|
|18. Ben Simmons|\+6|2 triple double's in the last 3 games, shooting 58% from the field, Philly winning, looking more comfortable with Jimmy Butler in the mix. He's a top 20 player.|
|19. Andre Drummond|\+2|18/16 averages, a truly unique player in today's game, I would consider him just about a guaranteed all star right now.|
|20. Steven Adams|\+6|Ranked 26th on December 3, I said that was likely his ceiling. I was wrong. Long considered a meme on this sub, Adams is having a breakout season and is now a serious candidate for the all star game.|
|21. Rudy Gobert|\+1|Career high in PPG, FG%, and low key having a career year. Mitchell might have sophomore slumped but Gobert is the least of Utah's worries.|
|22. Kemba Walker|\-2|He's actually shooting the least efficient he has in 3 seasons. But, the Hornets are..just kind of a mini mess and that's not his fault. A month ago I would have thought it was a guarantee he stays in Charlotte after this year. Not so sure now.|
|23. Karl-Anthony Towns|\+8|He's crucial to Minnesota's success. Unreal talent that has him a top 25 player right now but to move higher than this needs to show more.|
|24. John Wall|\+3|A 40/14 game vs. the Lakers a few games ago helps. Shooting the most efficient he has in his career low key. A polarizing player with his contract but he's a top 25 player right now.|
|25. Jrue Holiday|same|The Pelicans have issues but Holiday continues to be low key elite. Dude can put up 25/12 (like last night) and you won't even notice. |
|26. Klay Thompson|\-8|Shooting the least efficient he has since 2012-2013, but 22 PPG and he's shown the ability to go off any random night.|
|27. Bradley Beal|\+6|Overall has progressed from last season despite the issues in DC.|
|28. Victor Oladipo|\-5|Pacers are 4th in the west and he's got a career high in RPG + APG. But scoring wise he's not where he was at last year. But, he did recently come back from injury and could for sure move back up.|
|29. Chris Paul|\-10|Averaging a career low in PPG and shooting the least efficient he has since 2006-2007. But, he's had some good games still (like last night) and stays in the top 30.|
|30. Mike Conley|\+8|Will he make the all star game? This might be his best chance but the Grizzlies have been a mess since the trade fiasco.|
|31. Clint Capela|\-3|Has improved from last year and has been consistent, if the Rockets can get back in a consistent groove he can move up.|
|32. Jayson Tatum|\+7|Consistent scorer, underrated on this sub for whatever weird reason, nearly matching his ridiculous efficiency from last year on a higher volume of shots. It's been progress this year.|
|33. CJ McCollum|\-4|Career worst from 3 point land isn't good, but he comes up in clutch moments and at 22 PPG for the 5 seed Blazers he keeps a top 35 spot.|
|34. Serge Ibaka|\+2|Having a career scoring year for the best team in the NBA, I feel like this is probably his ceiling but I said that about Steven Adams 17 days ago so who knows.|
|35. Pascal Siakam|\-1|The consistency has continued 2 months into the season and he looks to be one of the more unique players going into next decade.|
|36. Devin Booker|\-4|He's been great the last 4 games and is starting to assert himself, up 10 spots from his finish in 2017-2018. 32% 3 PT is bad but he'll move up if he keeps playing the way he has.|
|37. Luka Doncic|\+16|A unique player who keeps making a name for himself with 19/7/5 averages as a teenager. We'll see how far he can move up throughout the season.|
|38. Julius Randle|\+13|19/10 averages, improved long range shooting, and a scoring threat nobody in the NBA wants to guard.|
|39. LaMarcus Aldridge|\+1|He's regressed from last year's All NBA level, but still a top 40 player who has been more consistent as of late.|
|40. Tobias Harris|\-10|Career high in PPG with nice efficiency, but with the Clippers struggles lately you'd like to see him do more. Still a top 40 player but hasn't been able to get over the consistency hump to reach his top 25 potential.|
|41. Khris Middleton|\-6|As Giannis breaks out even more, Middleton is taking a back seat but that being said he's still been a solid number 2 option for the number 2 team in the East.|
|42. Eric Bledsoe|\+6|Bledsoe is one of the toughest point guard matchups in the NBA, has upped the consistency, very underrated.|
|43. Donovan Mitchell|\+1|The shooting efficiency is down, 5-26 last night is not good. But Utah still won and the ridiculous talent is still there just needs to put everything together.|
|44. Draymond Green|\+2|Scoring wise he's clearly down, thankfully the other areas of his game have remained elite and he's still crucial to the Warriors' success.|
|45. Domantas Sabonis|\+5|My very clear pick for 6MOY right now. Continues to be consistent and has shown he can be special long term. I'm serious, in 2021 we could be talking about a top 15 player.|
|46. Marc Gasol|\-5|I'm a very passionate Grizzlies fan, but when I saw the Ringer had him as the number 10 player in the NBA I laughed out loud. He's better than last year but he doesn't give 100% at all times, and can get beat on defense by clearly inferior players a lot. Still, a step up from last year when I had him 61st.|
|47. Jusuf Nurkic|\-4|Has shown ridiculous talent at times but a bit inconsistent. Still, a top 50 overall player this year with 14/10 averages on the winning Blazers.|
|48. Al Horford|\-11|Has been injured, value down|
|49. Zach LaVine|\-4|His scoring talent is ridiculous, but with him injured now I'm interested to see the effect on his value until he comes back.|
|50. Nikola Vucevic|\-1|Last night showed us all we need to know about how important he is to this Magic team, when they lost by 39 to San Antonio without him.|
|51. Myles Turner|\+18|Sabonis might have the flair, but I would argue Turner is the biggest reason for this team's success in the month of December. Low key a DPOY candidate.|
|52. DeAndre Jordan|\+7|He's been consistent, Mavs now down to 9 seed but he's not fun to guard for opposing centers.|
|53. De'Aaron Fox|\+13|Fox continues his impressive sophomore leap and is now a borderline top 50 player.|
|54. Jamal Murray|\+2|As I saw another redditor mention, if Murray can become an elite passer this Nuggets team could become the new Warriors.|
|55. Derrick Rose|\+6|His incredible bounce back year continues and he is the clear favorite for MIP.|
|56. Thaddeus Young|\+22|Like Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young makes a big leap as well. He's been very impressive this month and a thread on this forum mentioned he should be Eastern Conference Player of the Week earlier in the month.|
|57. Gary Harris|\-15|Still injured, value down.|
|58. Josh Richardson|\-4|Hasn't been as flashy as earlier in the season but consistently putting up buckets.|
|59. Lou Williams|\-12|Struggled a bit this month, now injured and value down.|
|60. Robert Covington|\-3|Crucial on defense, has been inconsistent on offense but a very nice 22 point game last night.|
|61. JJ Redick|\-1|Still averaging a career high in PPG at 34 years old for the winning 76ers.|
|62. Jonas Valanciunas|\+6|An interesting case. Played well at the beginning of the month but now injured. He's valuable to this Raptors team but overshadowed.|
|63. Paul Millsap|\-5|Injured, value down. |
|64. DeAndre Ayton|\+1|It's been a very up and down month, but the 23/18 game last night shows just how talented he can be.|
|65. Aaron Gordon|\-13|I'm a big Aaron Gordon fan and he has a unique skillset, but he hasn't been consistent enough lately and the Magic need more of him.|
|66. Kevin Love|\-4|Still injured, value down|
|67. Brandon Ingram|\-3|Has shown flashes of talent, but injured right now and value down.|
|68. Joe Ingles|\+4|Has been inconsistent scoring, then he has games like the 20 pointer in a win vs. the Warriors last night and overall has been efficient on the season. Value down from last year but still a top 75 talent.|
|69/. Montrezl Harrell|\-6|Still putting in work with 15/7, but with the Clippers struggling he moves down this list.|
|70. Buddy Hield|\+24|Buddy Hield makes a big leap. His scoring has remained efficient and he's going to be dangerous for a while.|
|71. Kyle Kuzma|\+8|Overall progress has been made from his rookie season. We'll see what his ceiling is but so far so good.|
|72. Danilo Gallinari|\-1|Gallinari gets buckets but his impact other than 3 point shooting is minimal. Still, a big bounce back from being injured last year.|
|73. Willie Cauley-Stein|same|He's an interesting player. Ridiculous talent, inconsistent but the talent is there. Will the Kings sign him long term? IDK but someone will.|
|74. TJ Warren|\+7|Playing consistent and his ridiculous 3 point shooting surge makes him a top 75 player right now. |
|75. Andrew Wiggins|\+5|He's played a lot better in December and is back in the top 75. Still a long way to go but there's been progress.|
|76. Malcolm Brogdon|\+7|Low key having a great year. Having a hamstring issue right now but has been very consistent on the floor.|
|77. Bojan Bogdanovic|\+16|Having a career season, at 16 PPG with ridiculous efficiency. Playing consistent and making a name for himself.|
|78. Dennis Schroder|\-8|Crucial to the team's success, progress from last year, but let's not get suspended for stupid stuff.|
|79. Nikola Mirotic|\-24|Injured and value way down. Pelicans struggling and his great scoring year can't overcome the odd fit in the lineup right now.|
|80. Marcus Morris|\-5|Minor injury right now but still one of the nicest scoring threats off the bench in the league.|
|81. Jeff Teague|\+9|Had some nice passing games that raised his value (career high 8.3 APG) but needs to stay healthy to stay here.|
|82. Ricky Rubio|\+2|It hasn't been the greatest year but 13/6/4 averages with some nice games here and there are enough to keep him firmly in the top 100 for now.|
|83. Goran Dragic|\-16|Has been injured this month, value down.|
|84. Caris LeVert|\+1|Still injured but value up. |
|85. Hassan Whiteside|\-8|Chemistry issues aren't helping (and were somewhat predictable) but he's basically a top 100 talent blindfolded and it would take a lot for him to fall out.|
|86. Harrison Barnes|\+14|Cracked the top 100 early in the month. Has continued to be efficient + consistent and is steadily moving up.|
|87. Spencer Dinwiddie (RE-ENTRY)|\+17|It's been a great month for him. Nets are winning, scoring efficient, and just signed an extension. Stock Rising.|
|88. Otto Porter Jr|\-1|Injured and value about the same but after a top 55 finish last year this isn't good.|
|89. Dwyane Wade |\-3|Hasn't played all the time, but still showing why he's a legend. About to turn 37 and still a clear top 100 player right now.|
|90. Jaylen Brown|\-16|Good start to the month but last 3 games 6-25 shooting. There is no way he should be a borderline top 100 player, he stays in the top 90 but needs to step his game up.|
|91. John Collins (NEW)|\+54|Clearly a big riser. Dude is dangerous and we are looking at a top 25 talent if he can get a consistent 3 point shot. Still 21, look out.|
|92. Dario Saric|\+6|His ceiling might not be what we thought a year ago (53rd overall in 2017-2018) but he looks like he can be a very solid role player for years to come.|
|93. D'Angelo Russell (NEW)|\+13|It's been low key a very good year for D'Angelo. Has improved and is showing the ceiling he had in the draft over 3 years ago can still somehow be reached.|
|94. Jerami Grant (NEW)|\+16|He's had a great year overall and a top 100 ranking proves this. His start to the season was very slow and so was OKC's, not a coincidence.|

Here is why: LeBron is the most calculated player in league history. He is undoubtedly aware of the trade negotiations and conditions surrounding the Kawhi trade. 


LeBron has only one objective: to be on the best team possible. 


As soon as PG signs to the Lakers LeBron is assured of playing alongside at least one star AND crucially his commitment to the Lakers would severely limit the offers the Spurs will get from competing teams and essentially force a Kawhi trade to the Lakers. 


Why would this be the case? Because a) the Spurs would no longer be able to say ""you are trading for Kawhi and LeBron"" in negotiations and b) other teams considering trading for Kawhi would be a lot more reticent to do so with Kawhi already saying he wants to be a Laker and a super team waiting for him there.

Chris Paul Why?  Not as Flashy, but just as good a scorer and far superior floor general.  Much more complete player.  Also the most clutch player in the league.  Not that Rose isn't clutch just not as clutch as the most clutch player in the league. 

Deron Williams Before his exile in NJ was considered on par with CP3.  Has come back from injury fully rehabbed, just has a shitty team.  Pretty much same reasons as CP3  Just as good a scorer although not as flashy and a far superior floor general.


**Depends on how your team is constructed**

Rajon Rondo Best defender at the PG position bar none.  Except maybe his team mate Avery Bradley WHO IS NOT A SHOOTING GUARD.  Best court vision except for maybe Nash.  Very good at getting to rim (not as good as Rose) and not a good shooter.  What Rose does have on Rondo is a much better jumper that really opens up his game and makes him a much more complete offensive player.  Rose is a decent defender in his own right as well. Rose can't touch Rondo's court vision with a 10 foot pole.  Depending on how your team is constructed I could see either being selected over the other. 



Russell Westbrook is very similar to Rose.  The big difference between them I think is that Westbrook is more athetlic and has more potential while Rose is more developed and skilled.  Westbrook can get to the basket ANY time he wants.  Rose is a good penetrator, but he  ain't at Westbrook's level.  Also Rose isn't capable of going on the kind of offensive tears Westbrook is in short periods of time, but he is a much more consistent player and won't have the shit games that Westbrook sometimes has.

####**""Trae's only been playing as well as Luka for half a season""**  
In the last 4 of 5.5 months, Trae has clearly been the superior player. Although he still lags behind in PPG and RBG, he has been considerably more efficient (a cool 56.4 TS% vs. below-league-average 53.8 TS%), shooting better from the field, from the stripe, and from 3 (an icy 37.5% vs. a sad sad 31.7%).

####**""But Trae doesn't contribute to winning! What about defense?""**  
The Mavs are only THREE games above the Hawks, and they've gone 19-34 since December 1st. Meanwhile, the Hawks have posted 21-30.

AND Trae's had a higher Net Rating than Luka in that timespan. Trae's DRTg is indeed worse than Luka's, but Trae still contributes to more winning basketball.

And Trae hasn't missed a game this season, a valuable skill in itself.

Kuzma and Hart during the recent Lakers game).

The biggest thing I see against Kyrie is his defense which too me is personally surprising considering how much he looked up to Kobe, you would think Kobe would of instilled the importance of defense.

Besides that dude is a great player and would great player to make an elite tandem in the league. Imagine kyrie paired with demarcus or anthony davis for example.

I also feel people feel compelled to shit out Kyrie to prop up Lebron, its as if people feel that by celebrating kyrie you are dismissing lebron in some way.

Capela and CP3 had the worst series of their careers almost, so him losing to them is considered a choke on his part and has continued the narrative of him not performing in the playoffs.. He averaged 35,7,8 on good efficiency... just why do people do this to Harden..?

-Kawhi Leonard gets to the face the Warriors without KD and eventually even without Klay, he gets tremendous help from Lowry and FVV (who received a Finals MVP vote) and wins the series, and is now crowned the best player in the league by most because he's now the Finals MVP, and beat an injured Warriors roster.

- The most confusing part is how James Harden was able to put up better stats and had a better overall series against the Warriors while they were at full strength, while having a worse roster than Kawhi, yet still is considered worse than Kawhi and a continued choker. 

-And no, Kawhi did not ""completely take over games or put up insane stats in the fourth, unlike Harden""

-These things make me reconsider a little at least. The hypocrisy and media narrative really controls what the fans think and spout.


-Also to anyone who's about to make the defense argument, Curry was not a two way guy in his unanimous year, yet he was BY FAR the best player that year.

244,Dear Kobe Bryant,22,tz2x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tz2x2/dear_kobe_bryant/,161,1337713151.0,"I've been a fan of the Lakers since I watched Magic and Kareem win titles in the 80s.  

I remember that wonderful summer when we landed Shaq, the game's best center at the time, and also drafted a 17 year old kid named Kobe Bryant.

I remember watching you as a child in a league filled with guys twice your age.  I remember when we played Utah in the playoffs during your rookie year, and Stockton and Malone were too much for you guys.  I remember you launching threes at the end of those games that didn't even draw iron... but I remember thinking wow, that kid is gutsy.

And when Glen Rice came to town, and suddenly the Lakers won 60 games, I thought maybe this team could be really good.  And then we played the Blazers in the playoffs, and it was elimination game, and they were up by FIFTEEN POINTS in the 4th quarter, and Scottie Pippen looked filled with confidence, I admit man, I was scared.  But you and Shaq weren't scared.  You guys pulverized them, erased that 15 point lead, and we made it to the finals.  And for the next couple of years, no one could stop the Lakers.  I almost felt sorry for Indiana, Philidelphia, and New Jersey in the finals, because they never looked like they even had a chance.

And then one year the Spurs wooped our asses, and I thought well, they need new blood.  We never really replaced Glen Rice.  Maybe we just need another scorer.  And then that offseason, bam, we got Karl Malone and Gary Payton.  And then you spent that whole year complaining about how Shaq was out of shape, how the Lakers looked ""old and tired"", and how you weren't getting as many shots as you should be getting.

And you know what, I thought it was kind of weird that a guy who averaged 25 points a game was saying he didn't get enough shots.  

And then they shipped Shaq out of town to make room for your ego, and Phil Jackson quit and said you were uncoachable, and Karl Malone said you were a bad team mate, and Shaq went to Miami and won a title with DWade, while you were all by yourself on the Lakers.  And you averaged 178 points per game, and that one game you scored 786 points in a single quarter, and the team was finally, unquestionably ""yours"", except for one problem: it sucked.  We won 34 games a year for a while there and it was pretty ugly, Kobe, I'm not gonna lie to you.  It was pretty damn ugly.

And then some good things happened.  We got Gasol... a guy who on paper was the perfect team mate for you.  A good passer, good shooter, skilled post player, committed rebounder.  He was solid, hard working, and he hardly ever gets hurt.  

And the two of you got together, and Phil Jackson was back, and damned if you guys didn't get back to the top.  And suddenly Shaq looked old in Phoenix, and I started to think maybe you were right all along, maybe your dynasty would one day be as great as Magic and Kareem's.  

But Kobe, this season, you really lost me again.  I don't understand why you played almost 40 minutes a game when you have more games and minutes under your belt than all but 15 guys in history.  I don't understand why you took it upon yourself to decide that Gasol was now the ""number three"" option on your team, and to declare that to the general public.  And I don't understand why you feel the need to jack up 25 shots per game, almost more than Bynum and Gasol put together, even though those guys shoot in the 50s and you shoot in the low 40s.  Kobe, those guys score more efficient points than you do, bro.  Why don't you feed them the ball more?

Kobe, what I think you don't understand is that being a great competitor and a great team mate isn't just about intensity.  It's also about INSPIRING people.  It's about motivating people.  It's about empowering people.  All you seem to do with your team mates is to give them muted praise when you win, and yell and gripe at them when you lose.

Remember when you were on Youtube, trashing Andrew Bynum and saying they should ""trade his ass"" for Jason Kidd?  Remember when you called Gasol ""soft"" all those times?  See dude, that's what makes guys want to not play with you.  And when guys don't want to play with you, they lose motivation, they lose energy.  

I'm not sure why you felt the need to jack up 130 shots in the series against OKC, when Gasol and Bynum combined only took about 120, even though they both shoot at a much higher percentage than you do, and even though we know the All Kobe All The Time Offense doesn't really work.  It never has, right?

So please, Kobe, do Laker nation a favor.  AFTER they trade Gasol (because they will, the Lakers do whatever you tell them to do) and AFTER they trade Bynum (because he's already asking to be traded, because he hates you), PLEASE, PLEASE do us a favor and finally learn from your many mistakes.  Don't throw your new team mates under the buss.  Don't launch up contested jumper after ill-advised fadeaway on possession after possession even though there's still 21 seconds left on the shotclock and even though there's two hall of fame calibur guys wide open.  Please, don't do that.  Instead, try getting your team mates involved in the game.  Don't ask for them to be traded, don't go on KCAL 9 and tell everyone what the pecking order is as far as talent, don't publicly question their commitment, don't undermine their games, don't tell them to stop worrying about shots and just worry about rebounding and defense, in short, don't do ALL of the things you've always done to your poor team mates.

Just be nice to them, let them play their game, and especially if we somehow get Dwight Howard for Bynum, Kobe, please, understand that he is a sensitive guy and he doesn't want to be bullied by a big loudmouth like you in the media.  Just repsect him, let him be himself, and if you lose, just lose like a man.  It's ok to lose, Kobe.  Lots of teams lose every single year in the playoffs, and they manage to do so without giving their team mates a tongue lashing in the media.

That's about all.  Also, one last thing, please abandon the Heroball you like to play in the closing minutes of close games.  It's a bad offense.  If we got to a tie game by playing team ball, then lets finish the game with team ball.  We can all read, buddy, so we know that you only hit those mythical game-winners about a third of the time.  The other two third of those horrible shots you take with 0:21 left in the close games just miss the mark entirely, so please, knock it with the 4th quarter masonry clinics you like to put on in close games.",0.55,controversial,2012-05-22 11:59:11

\- Shooting 50% from beyond the arc! Albeit, he's only shot from there twice.

I'll admit I don't watch them play very often, but it looks like they're starting to bring everything full-circle. Best of luck to Hassan Whiteside, Carmelo Anthony and the Trail-Blazers.

It's just as nasty and toxic as the garbage Kaepernick had thrown at him from NFL fans. The really messed up thing is that there is a ton of support for the thought, but Kyrie has to eat all the damage himself because everyone else aside from Dwight and Avery Bradley are afraid to speak up, and people are accusing him of doing it for attention or some stupid ulterior motive. If people didn't leak it, there would be zero attention because no one would know about it! 

What Kyrie Irving's personal beliefs are, what he did in Boston, or whatever else have no relevance at all to his argument because he's just correct. Just because he might believe the Earth is flat doesn't mean he's wrong if he says 1+1=2.

Also people need to stop pretending that they care about mid/low level NBA players financial security. Also pretending to care about the players potentially having an even bigger platform if they resume play. That's so phony.

The straight up bullying behavior exhibited about/towards Kyrie is super gross too. 

Hate on the man if you absolutely must, but just recognize that he alone is getting straight up eviscerated by the media and fans for representing an idea shared by a significant amount of NBA players and he's taking it all silently and without backing down.",0.54,controversial,2020-06-18 05:24:09

One said he’s “woke college kid on twitter but playing in the nba”. There’s been tons of reference to his flat earth theory, woj called him “a disruptor”, lots of folks on here wouldn’t want him on their team. All this because he believes the NBA season should be canceled. 

Let me say, as a black dude, I’ve always found that the actions that have brought change or progression for black folks have always been unpopular and decried by the mainstream. As such, often when I see any sort of movement intended to seek justice for black folks and that move is widely popular or accepted by the mainstream, it gives me pause. 

Kyrie is 100% right. The NBA players boycotting the rest of the season is the most powerful statement they can make. I saw a post on here that claimed the reason Ali was able to make such strong social impact is because he was playing well and speaking out simultaneously. Ironically that same poster accused Kyrie of being out of touch with reality. They either are out of touch with reality themselves or simply refuse to realize the obvious truth which was that Ali REFUSED to be drafted for war. Him refusing, and losing his boxing license is irrefutably what makes Ali who he is. 

Lebron is my favorite player ever. He’s wrong here. Sure you can play and try to promote however you can, ie T-shirts, post game interviews, whatever. However, nothing would be as powerful as hearing the best basketball player, probably ever, certainly in a long time, announce he’s sitting out a season to protest racial injustice. Will he do it? Probably not. Is it fair to ask him to do it? Probably not. I understand it’s hard to be a black athlete in a capitalist system. Yet that’s the hand he’s been dealt and fairly or unfairly, this will factor into how people judge him in the future. 

For everyone else that believes somehow the NBA returning gives them a greater platform and thus they can influence more change, I have to again vehemently disagree. The idea of positive change as a gradual event that just comes with more time is not good enough for us black people. It has to happen now and demands radical actions. The NBA players boycotting there season would a step in that direction.",0.45,controversial,2020-06-13 18:52:38
248,An unexpected view of the Kevin Love trade from a Cavs fan's perspective,0,2edv6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2edv6j/an_unexpected_view_of_the_kevin_love_trade_from_a/,58,1408849019.0,"I've been a Cavaliers fan for about ten years now but I enjoy watching the NBA in general. Over the past five or so years the parity problem has grown out of control in the league. The first time that I personally can remember a team getting assembled that seemed to be an obvious favorite a championship was the Lakers back in 2004. Then the Heat happened in 2010. Luckily for the league these ""super"" teams did not win every year in which they are active. I've always said the worst thing for a sport is when one team or player dominates.

Now, on to how I feel about the Kevin Love trade. I fully expect downvotes because it's hard for people to grasp how a Cavs fan can be upset about acquiring Kevin Love but I can honestly say that I am disappointed. For me, getting Love was overkill and what bothers me most is the fact that there was no way in hell Love would have wanted to play in Cleveland without LeBron and Kyrie. It is blatant ring chasing. I would rather see a team win a championship with players that developed their skills with that team and are dedicated to performing the best they can for that given city and franchise than a team assembled of various all stars taking less money just to cruise to a championship. I realize winning a championship is never easy but my point is that these players know what they are doing. They know that their legacy will be tarnished by not carrying or leading the team to a championship.

If the Cavs do with a title over the next two years what will LeBron's legacy be? He couldn't win by himself in Cleveland before, so he collaborated with two other all stars. He wins in Miami but many still feel his legacy has not been fulfilled. Coming back to Cleveland was his chance but now with Love joining him he's back in the same situation as Miami. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm very happy that the Cavs will be competitive this year but I can't help but feel that this trend of collaboration is bad for the league and any championship won with the new ""Big 3"" will have a figurative asterik next to it. This is probably not a popular opinion but I wanted to see if anyone else (especially Cavs fans felt the same way).",0.49,controversial,2014-08-23 19:56:59

Here are the facts - Lebron stepped over draymond green, green retaliated with a swing to the groin. Lebron received a technical, and draymond a flagrant and suspension. 

So here's the deal. Stepping over people, taunting, and things of that nature are typically great reasons to deal out a technical foul. So the NBA got this one RIGHT, and the refs WRONG. Lebron did not initiate any more unnecessary physical contact(unless you want to nitpick that lebrons calf brushed on green's shoulder, or something like that) so all he receives is a tech. 

Draymond green initiated unnecessary physical contact, which warrants a flagrant 1 or 2. He got a one, which still means a suspension. What is so unclear about that? If sides flipped and Lebron swung at Green's groin, the outrage would be MASSIVE and everyone would cry for a flagrant. 

Looking back at the thunder series, yeah he did deserve to be suspended but the fact is he DIDNT. If he did get that extra flagrant vs Okc, he would've been suspended for a game GSW would've likely lost. Now let's assume he's suspended and the Dubs still win out the series, and the altercation between Green and LBJ still happens. Green will still get a flagrant 1, and receive another one game suspension. So what is the problem exactly?

The only people really, who should be upset about Green's suspension should be Thunder fans. They were screwed, and that is wrong on the NBA's fault. But things happen. Everyone else on the Warriors bandwagon really shouldn't have anything to complain. Nobody earned all those flagrants except for Green so he has nobody to blame but himself for his physical play. 

For those who claim ""How should you react to nuts on your neck?!?""... Think about this. Lebron steps over him, draymond DOESNT swing, and gets in lebrons face and bumps chests with him. That would immediately result in a double tech, no suspension, the refs would have gotten it right, and we would enter game 5 with both teams having their whole squad. Point is, what Green did was completely unnecessary and warranted a flagrant one, leading to his suspension and no one has ANY REASON to be upset with the way the NBA handled this.

Outside of his 4 years with the Heat. 

When speaking of Lebron’s accolades, ring counting, his choice to switch teams multiple times in his prime, his finals record, comparing him to Magic, Kobe, MJ, Duncan, people need to really sit back and realize how much worse Lebron’s situation was compared to others.

Basically every other top 10ish player ever had ANOTHER all-nba/HOF level player early in their career, that helped them win a championship and achieve consistency and continuity with their organization. On top of this, a lot of them had an all time great coach. 

MJ had Scottie. (And Phil Jackson)

Magic had Kareem, Worthy, Cooper & Scott. (And Pat Riley)

Larry Bird had Mchale, Parish and Johnson. (And KC Jones)

Kobe had the actual best player in the league, Shaq. (And Phil Jackson)

Duncan had Robinson. (And Pop.) 



Even modern day legends like Steph, KD or Kawhi, love these guys taking nothing away from their greatness, had much better situations in order to beat Lebron in the finals, but if jerseys were swapped, it wouldn’t have been a contest. 

It’s not a coincidence that these players have more rings than Lebron and won them all with one team. Lebron would have never left if the Cavs would have “gotten” him a D Wade. Or a Kyrie Irving. Let alone, not just a competent coach like Eric Spo, but an all time great HOF coach. 

Just think among all the Bron slander and hate we need to remember that the guy got drafted to the Browns of the NFL. A sorry franchise that had nothing before him, and nothing after him. The only reason he was ever loyal to them in any regard, or went back, is because he just so happened to be born in Akron. 

Just saying, at what point do you say okay I have to take things into my own hands and move around. Sure, it’s led to him having 6 finals losses, but he also has 3 rings with 2 teams. Chasing his 4th on this Lakers contract. For all we know in some parallel universe Lebron could have zero or just 1 ring and way less appearances had he been “loyal.”",0.48,controversial,2019-03-25 02:20:09

You can't outgun the Warriors on offense. The way to beat them is flustering their offense and playing fast with lots of transition and fast break points. A key factor in doing this is being able to switch on them defensively. This is what the Houston Rockets did in the playoffs and held them to under 100 points in back to back games.

Now let's take a look at the Lakers roster right now.

PG:

* Lonzo - His solid defense is the only reason he's still on the team. 1.7 steals/game. 0.8 blocks. He's 6'6 allowing him to switch onto taller players. 30% from 3 last year. Still not a good idea to leave him open.
* Rondo - When he's not engaged in the game, he doesn't play defense. But when he is engaged, one of the smartest and fiercest competitors. 2-time all defensive first and second team. Getting old, but no pressure in a starting role. Able to get plenty of rest on bench.
* Isaac Bonga - Kind of an unknown. Only 18. Looks to have a really high ceiling. Extremely athletic at 6'10"". Can shoot and handle the ball. He's listed as playing ""point guard"". Capable of switching onto any position, especially as he continues to grow and develop.
* Gary Payton II - shouldn't play much if at all.

SG:

* KCP - Really solid 3 and D player. Able to switch defensively on 1-3.
* Lance - Pitbull when he's engaged in the game. Embraces the challenge of defending elite players. Able to switch on to 1-3, and some 4. Not really an elite defender, but when you want to fluster the other team, he is a great choice. I can see him drawing technicals out of guys like Draymond and Boogie.
* Josh Hart - I don't know if he's a 1, 2, or 3 - but he's able to switch on all those positions defensively. High effort player. Defensively engaged off the ball. 39.6% from 3 last year.
* Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk - High IQ. Athletic. Great shooter and can score in many ways. 6'6"". This kid looks incredible. Not bad on defense either.
* Andre Ingram - Don't expect to be a factor at all, if he's even on the team just including him because of his story. First NBA game at age 32 last year. Oldest rookie since 1964. His first game was like something out of a movie. Would be really cool if he ended up getting some minutes. Looks like a really good guy and great locker room presence.

SF:

* Ingram - Ceiling is becoming a top 5 player in the league one day. Really solid defensively. Athletic and big wingspan. Can switch onto 1-3. Can play SG or ""point forward"".
* Luol Deng - ?????? Not expecting him to play, but really have no idea? Could be a wildcard if he does end up playing.

PF:

* LBJ - don't need to say anything here.
* Kuzma - Very high ceiling. Maybe one of the most underrated players. Perfect player to play the 4 in a small ball lineup. Can switch onto almost any position. Good 3 shooter, good post moves & ballhandling. Going to be one of my favorite players to watch this year.
* Travis Wear - most likely won't play, though has ability to play positions 1-4.

C:

* McGee - Can switch onto guys like Durant. Showed his defensive value on Lebron in the finals.
* Wagner - 7 footer that can shoot the 3. Not great defensively, but a high IQ and high effort player.
* Zubac - I'm not big on the guy. He's a young 7 footer. Doubt he'll get many minutes. Would be a pleasant surprise if he develops into anything. Good backup in case on injury.

At first I thought the Lakers needed to trade for a guy like Kawhi or Lillard, but the more I think about it, why would you want to bring in an established superstar when you have multiple blossoming superstars on your roster? Kawhi would've been a good fit, but I'm not even sure it's worth giving up 2 of the 3 between kuzma, ingram, lonzo, let alone some draft picks. He barely played last season. Kawhi is a humble superstar, which I like, but his current situation  could've brought in more drama that the Lakers don't need. There are also just a lot of things we don't know about Kawhi's situation and what he wants as a player.

Lebron is the best player and probably the hardest working player in the league. He played every game last year.  These young bucks want to prove themselves now more than ever and will not slack off with him on the team. Bringing in an established superstar would've risked ruining the team chemistry in my opinion. This team has low individual egos and that is exactly what you want in any team sport. We also have future coach Rondo to motivate the team and help Lonzo become an elite point guard.

When you look over the Lakers roster, you will notice how versatile and interchangeable most of their players are. This is what you must do to win in the current NBA. The criticism everyone keeps giving is that the Lakers have no shooters. I think they have plenty for their style of basketball. KCP, Hart, Sviatoslav, Ingram, LBJ, Kuzma, Wagner can all shoot 3 pointers.  Remember, the goal here is not to outdo them on offense. With Lonzo's speed and court vision, they can and will play fast. This is where being a deep team helps them too. They have 4 ""shooting guards"" that I believe will see minutes, all of which have length, stretch the floor and can play the 3 as well. 2 great creative passing point guards that can play defense, with Bonga as a wild card. Solid small forward in Ingram. Lebron can play any position. Kuzma can play 1-4 and then 3 7 foot centers. Having these 7 or so players than can move around positions gives you the ability to tremendously reduce fatigue when you are playing fast and playing hard defense.

Obviously when you have this kind of roster, there are tons of possibilities for different lineups. I believe this is one of their biggest strengths. Let's just imagine one for fun.

1. Lonzo
2. KCP
3. Ingram
4. Kuzma
5. Lebron

I could go on forever listing lineups. There are so many good combinations. They can go small or big. They can have all shooters. They are able to combine the ""surround Lebron with shooters"" style of play which has been effective in the past with the Rockets' abilities to switch defensively which was also effective.

Let's think about the Warriors for a minute. The reaction to the Boogie signing is extremely blown out of proportion in my opinion. This guy has a big potential to be a cancer for the team. He's coming back Achilles injury. He was never the most athletic of players, but it's hard to imagine he's going to come back the same as he was. He's only a low paying one year deal. As great as a passer as he is, I believe he is somewhat of a selfish player. I can see him being a big ball stopper and disruption to the Warriors ball movement, especially when he is in a one year contract deal and presumably wants to prove his worth on the court after being injured so he can get paid next year. Something else about the Warriors that I began to notice last year and maybe I'm wrong, but I sense a looming disruption in team chemistry. Durant has stolen the show from Curry. I watch all the playoff press conferences, and I do think this kind of rubs Curry the wrong way, maybe even just subconsciously. I believe this can ruin the flow of the team's offense where one player tries to play hero ball, or they begin taking turns, rather than executing. This is a great opportunity for the Lakers defense to pounce. Klay Thompson is also in a contract year and he's made it pretty clear that he wants to get paid. Now, I like Klay and he plays great team ball but this is just one more wrench to throw in the team chemistry. And, yes the Lakers do have lots of 1 year deals, but none of these guys are looking to get big contracts afterwards. They are all there to win.

The Cavs kept it close with the Warriors for 2 games and really should've won. That Cavs team was a complete joke. Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love, Jr Smith, a washed up George Hill, Larry Nance. What a complete joke. This Lakers team is unbelievably better than that Cavs team. I know this doesn't mean that much, but Lonzo's only time facing the Warriors was November last season in which the Warriors needed OT to win. They were playing their full lineup. Obviously this is a different Lakers team and they are much better now.

If you believe in NBA conspiracy theories, you know they would love a Lakers v Celtics Finals with Lebron v Kyrie, so maybe the refs will help out the Lakers.

I think it will be the Lakers and Celtics in the finals this season. The Celtics will not be an easy matchup, but I think the Lakers will win.

Please feel free to tell me I'm way off wrong, comment, ask questions or whatever.

**TLDR: The Lakers will win because of their team chemistry, defensive switching ability, youthful energy, leadership, and their wide variety of lineups.**",0.46,controversial,2018-07-17 08:05:41

In the scheme of things, I'm sure most players who never won a ring, like Barkley or Malone or whatever, would sacrifice a single 20m (for example) contract year to replace it with a ring and 5 million.

Demarcus basically just did that, and assuming he rehabs fine (which he obviously believes he will), he won't have the regret of never winning a ring later on in life.

Something doesn't show up on the stat sheet, however, and that's Bill Russell's defensive impact. 

The year before Bill arrived, the Celtics had a 90.7 defensive rating, 2nd worst in the NBA. That DRASTICALLY changed when Bill arrived. In all but one season of Bill's career, the Celtics had the leagues best defense by far, often boasting a defensive rating 4-8 pts higher than that of the second place team. After Bill retired, the Celtics immediately dropped from the best defensive team to the 7th best out of 14 teams. They went from a defensive rating 6.9 above average to one that was only 0.6 above average. That's going from a great defensive team to a mediocre team defensively. The Celtics went 34-48 that season, missing the playoffs entirely. 

He has by far the greatest defensive impact out of any player in NBA history and maybe even the greatest impact on one end of the floor. These defensive numbers do not show up in stat sheets, but they do equate into team success which is all that mattered for Bill. 

 It's clear his defensive impact was greater than that of Wilt's offensive impact. Wilt won when he took less shots, and his selfishness often costed his team and his teammates when it mattered. Bill and Hakeem are the only centers to lead a title team in PTS and AST in the playoffs. (Bill did it in 2 runs, one leading in PTS, one in AST)  

As for the ""Bill had 8 HOFers"" argument. It's easier to make the Hall when you're a 6+ champ. Throughout Bill and Wilt's career, they had the exact same number of All Star teammates. People forget Wilt's great teammates over the years: Jerry West, Goodrich, Greer, Cunningham, Elgin Baylor, Thurmond, Guy Rodgers, Tom Gola, Chet Walker, etc... In all of Wilt's scoring title seasons, he didn't win a title. He also only led the playoffs ONCE in playoff ppg, so it didnt exactly translate either. 

In the season where Wilt led the league in assists, he avoided HOF teammate Chet Walker because he liked to take an dribble or 2 after receiving a pass from Wilt, which did not count as an assist. This type of stat oriented mentality doesn't equal into team success under any means. His inflated numbers often costed his team and teammates an opportunity to improve and play as a team to win championships. 

In his scoring title seasons, he never won a title, only made 1 finals, and had a 22-30 playoff record. It was only when he sacrificed those numbers to win that he experienced success. 

""Oh but Wilt was the most athletic player ever, he could do this and that"". Bill was actually extremely athletic as well, and athleticism isn't the be all end all of basketball. There have many players with extreme athletic ability who aren't then other guys with less those of gifts. This is NBA basketball, not the Olympics. 

Again, Wilt may woo the causal fan with his marvelous numbers or tales about his extreme atheltic ability, but when it comes to the game of basketball, it's clear who had the most impact when he was on the court.

While player's usually don't step their game up in regular season, they will against the rockets.  We're talking about pride and ego that NBA players have a bounty of.

Felton wants to shut people up   -   He's really going to want to show his worth, get into great shape and play hard.  He is playing the underachiever who wants to show up, which he obviously has the talent to do.  

I'm not trying to get into marketing and money issues, but from a purely basketball standpoint, this change at worst will be a wash and most likely we will see the re-awakening of a quality point guard who has something to prove.  Jeremy has everything to lose.  We might be incredibly surprised at how good this mix of players works and how Raymond Felton may be a sleeper for an All-star caliber season.

When people bring up Steph for MVP, people shout but he's not even the best player on his own team. How can you be MVP if you're team goes 10-1 without you.

If we're using that logic, then why is Giannis not ahead of Lebron in the MVP race?

Lets first take a look at the individual stats for each player:

Giannis: 29/10/5 on 62% TS  
Lebron: 27/8/9 on 64% TS

Not a big difference either way, I will also add Giannis is playing better defense than Lebron this year he is in the running for 2nd team all-defense at PF while lebron is not in the running for any all-defense team this year.

Now lets take a look at the VALUE each player adds for their respective teams.

here are the on/off stats for the cavs and bucks:

player|ORtg|DRtg|Net Rtg
:--|:--|:--|:--
Giannis ON|112.5|108.6|+3.9
Giannis OFF|105.8|117.3|-11.5
Lebron ON|114.8|113.6|+1.2
Lebron OFF|106.9|103.9|+3.0

The cavs actually have a higher net rtg when lebron is off the court then on the court. Even though they had a poor game last night, the bench has been playing really good all year the cavs statistically have the fifth best bench in the nba. If you took Lebron off the cavs,  they would still be a borderline playoff team and might miss the playoffs by one or two games in the eastern conference.

Bench|Pts|Pts allowed
:--|:--|:--
Cavs|41.4|32.4
MIL|24.9|36.5

If you take giannis off of the bucks, not only do they miss the playoffs, but they legitimately become in the running with the Atlanta Hawks for the team with the worst record in the NBA. They have arguably one of the worst coaches in the league(Jason Kidd) and statistically the third worst bench in the NBA, while the Cavs have the fifth best bench in the NBA. 

Why is the same logic that is being used to shout down the Warriors star players every time their name comes up not being used to move Giannis up ahead of Lebron in the MVP race?",0.5,controversial,2018-01-09 19:42:09
280,Study finds wage discrimination against Black athletes,3,9x0kft,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9x0kft/study_finds_wage_discrimination_against_black/,85,1542234591.0,""" There are multiple papers that study wage discrimination within the National basketball Association (NBA) in the 1980s and 1990s against black athletes. This paper revisits the topic to determine if the effects found previously are still prominent in recent NBA history using nearly 800 free agent signings from 2011-2017. Our data set using only free agency signings allows us to control for the effects of performance and player, coach, general manager, and team characteristics on player's wages, which presented a data limitation of the previous literature. Using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and weighted linear regression models, we find that black athletes are underpaid relative to their counterparts. We find that 72.7% of the wage gap found is explained by racial discrimination in our preferred specification. Black players receive on average 20.5% less than their counterparts, all else equal. Moreover, we investigate different sources of discrimination in this labor market. Weighted quantile regressions show evidence of consumer discrimination in that black players with high audience visibility (role and star players) experience a larger racial wage gap. The size of the share of the white population is shown to be positively correlated with the racial wage gap. No employee nor employer discrimination is found.""

I know its long, probably unbearable on mobile.  Tried to format it so that you can easily see my picks without having to read every word.  Let me know about any huge disagreements you have, or even minor quibbles. My criteria is mostly about who were the best this season.  I’ve watched a TON of games this year and have been watching the NBA for many years.  I look at counting stats and advanced stats.  Team record and games played matter, but not as much as the individual statistics as those indicate individual impact and being that these are for the most part individual awards, I weigh them heavier.  Also, note that I have been working on this for a number of days now, so not all the numbers will be exact, but I don’t think a 0.1 difference in PER should change my vote.   This year was pretty tough on who to leave off for some of the awards and so many players missed a good chunk of the season.  Let me know what you guys think.

###MVP

**1. James Harden**

This was a perfect example of an MVP season.  A player that’s been great for a number of years is the best player on the best team in the league and has incredible stats.   Harden led the league in scoring average and missed only a few games.  His .448 FG looks underwhelming at first, but getting to the line 10x a game and making almost four 3s a game puts his eFG at .540 and his TS around .620 which is elite, especially considering his volume of shots.  He led the league in PER, WS, and BPM.  His BPM of 11 is a textbook “amazing year” baseline.  PER of 30 puts him in a very elite group as well.  There’s not too much of an argument for the others, this was a fantastic showing by Harden and I believe he will finally get his first MVP award.  

**2. LeBron James**

Team record is the only thing that makes Harden the sure fire choice.  LeBron had a terrible January, but he played in all the games and by my estimation he had about 12 or 13 “bad” games.  However, playing in all the games will do that and Harden, Steph, Durant etc missed x amount of games and had poor showings on top of that.  LeBron just had most of his bad games in bunches which is what people will hold against him.  The few at the beginning of the year were mainly because he was pulled from the games early as the cavs got dicked down so hard in the first half they had no shot at a comeback.  The games in January were quite disturbing as well, but still, LeBron made over 10 FG a game for the first time since coming back to Cleveland and played the most minutes in the league while posting a career high in assists.  His efficiency is almost exactly what it was last year and topped only by his best three Miami years.  He had one of the years best performances in his 57 point assault in Washington that had the wizards hoping Gilbert Arenas was in the Cavs locker room.  He also led the league in games with a GmSc over 25 (pretty good, for example 21/12/6/5/1 on 10/16FG is right around a 25 GmSc) beating out Davis, Harden and Giannis respectively.  In addition to the massive roster changes/inconsistency, having Lue as a coach and still being in my opinion the clear best player on the planet, I think James warrants a top 2 finish.  


**3. Anthony Davis**

Davis had so many “Holy shit that guy just obliterated the other team” games this year, I could see him as high as first on a few ballots.  He’s in the running for DPOY as well which matters to me, and he really turned up after boogie went down (get well soon bby I love you).  The narrative has been that the supporting cast is trash and well….it is.  Jrue has played well of recent, but he’s not really that close to being an all star player.  Davis is unguardable and can guard nearly anyone in the league.  He led the league in blocks by a huge margin and was 2nd in scoring in an era where the big man is less and less utilized.  This is his best season and deserves all the credit in the world.  Despite him never having won a playoff game, he still averaged 31/11 and 3 blocks against what was the leagues best defense in 2015 on .540FG.  I’m excited to see him in the playoffs regardless of their seed and result.  


**4. Giannis Antetokounmpo**
Despite a middling record, Giannis essentially lit the league on fire this year.  With not much of a jumpshot he was still absolutely unguardable and became a defensive terror.  27/10/5/1.5/1.5 on over 50% from the field is obscene and I wonder if he shouldn’t be higher on the ballot. His showdowns with LeBron this season were classic and neither player could stop the other.  It looks like the bucks will be 8th in the east which is unfortunate as I don’t think they have an asshole’s chance in jail at beating the raptors, but hopefully we can see a few “holy shit this guy in beyond unstoppable and only 24 years old” games to extend the series a bit.  Giannis was top 5 in the league in field goals, PER, FG% of 20+ppg scorers, VORP, WS, scoring, and minutes per game.  This was simply too good of a statistical season not to have him in the top 4.  As far as I’m concerned, these top 4 are without question the top 4, in some order.  The Freak vs Brow debate will be fun these next few years.  

**5.  Damian Lillard**

This spot was difficult.  Westbrook (lol no), Durant, Curry, DeRozan, and Oladipo all got consideration from me.  I think Lillard putting the Blazers as high as they were in the west when many people had them 8th or worse to start the year was the defining reason.  It wasn’t just that they won, they won tons of games down the stretch that were all him.  He just slapped his wrist and ate the other teams’ soul and sank the improbable shot time and time again.  He posted a career high in eFG and FT% at an amazing .917 clip taking over 7 foul shots a game.  While battling the other western guards to make an all star slot, he’ll be ahead of all but one of them on the all-nba teams.  During the Blazers 13 game win streak, they beat Golden State twice, Cleveland, OKC, UTA, Miami, all while lillard was posting some insane numbers.  


###All NBA 1st Team

*G James Harden* *G Damian Lillard* *F LeBron James* *F Anthony Davis* *C Joel Embiid*

So the big thing here is that I’m not cheating and putting Davis at center.  In previous years (like last) I put him as center, but he just didn’t play that this year and I would feel disingenuous having him there just so I could put Giannis in the 1st team.  Cousins was the center for most of the year and now Okafor (who is playing alright tbh) plays as center.  He’s a forward, and he earned the first team spot over the Freak and last years Finals MVP.  I covered the first 4 in the MVP section, and Embiid has been stunning on defense with plenty of offense to warrant this slot.  If I had some criticism for the 7 foot clown who is incredible at basketball its that I would have liked to see him more assertive on a nightly basis.  Too many games he took too many jumpers or simply not enough shots to be as good as he could have been.  Still, philly was sensational on defense and he had games where he completely annihilated some trash (see: lakers, los angeles), as well as games where he outplayed some of the leagues best (see block: westbrook, Russell). Honestly if there was one story line that I took from this year, it might be Embiid.  This dude can shoot, has plenty of post moves, is MASSIVE, and can take over games like few players in the league.  Just watch the all star game, he mattered, he made a difference and if it weren’t for LeBron doing LeBron things, he would have been the ASG MVP.  No one wants to see Philly in the playoffs because no one has an answer for Embiid.  

###All NBA 2nd Team

*G Victor Oladipo* *G Russell Westbrook* *F Giannis Antetokounmpo* *F Kevin Durant* *C Karl-Anthony Towns*

**Ok**, this is where is gets very interesting.  While the 1st team is quite easy for me this year, I genuinely feel bad about some of the players I left off.  Let’s start with Oladipo.  The pacers were the 7 seed in the east last year, lost their best offensive player and best defensive player and gained Oladipo.  Their pre season vegas over under win total was in the 30s and Oladipo brought them to one of the top seeds, over the wizards, over Giannis, and in incredible fashion.  What impressed me most of all was his defense and 3 point shooting.  Along with his penetration, passing and athleticism which make him a good player, Oladipo was one of the best defenders at his position all year, and shot over 35% from deep.  He led the league in steals and shot over 50% from 2 for the first time in his career.  He also had a pretty low Turnover% despite his massive up tick in usage.  He had basically identical stats to DeRozan, but was more efficient in both FG, and TS%.  Of all the non 1st team guards, I feel Oladipo is the only one that HAS to be on the ballot in one of the remaining 4 spots.  

**Westbrook** gets the second slot on the second team, and I’m reluctant to give it to him, but he played way more games than his competitors and put up enough stats.  He’s such a hard player to analyze.  I definitely think he’s one of the best 10 players in the league, but I watched him LOSE soooooooo many games for his team.  He got substantially more talent around him and a bunch of elite defensive players and it didn’t translate to wins and a good chunk of that I put on Westbrook.  But on the flipside, there were also plenty of games where the other team had absolutely 0 answer for him and he won the game by himself.  If either of my 3rd teamers had more games played I would try to convince myself to put them over him, but Westbrooks overall season value can’t be ignored.  

**Durant** doesn’t need much explanation.  He was incredibly efficient and played on a team that won a ton of games and is clearly a top 5 player.  His defense was at an all-time high, especially at the beginning of the year.  However, the technicals and ejections really did hurt his team, he missed some games with the rib injury, and Golden State generally underperformed this season so I have him on the 2nd team.  Boo hoo.  

**Giannis** I covered in the MVP section.  Along with his team record, the stats show he shouldn’t get a spot over the King or the Brow. https://i.imgur.com/Lv9FUQX.png  If you are putting Davis at center, I would put Giannis over Durant for 1st team.  

**At Center** I’m going with Towns.  There have been flashes this year of him being great, and he’s been incredibly efficient (.542/.341/.856).  His production is actually incredible given the small amount of FGAs, for which I blame/hate Thibs.  I wish he would be more aggressive and take more shots as he’s clearly the best offensive player on the team and there aren’t many teams in the league that have any kind of answer for him at all.  However, I’m not going to penalize him for Wiggins thinking he’s the GOAT or Thibs not running a better offense.  

###All NBA 3rd Team

*G Stephen Curry* *G Chris Paul* *F Jimmy Butler* *F LaMarcus Aldridge* *C Nikola Jokic*

**Ok** so the big controversy will be with the guards.  Here are the numbers https://i.imgur.com/m7PLdqO.png .  Now to me, I can see arguments for any combination of those 4 in the last two spots.  DeRozan totally fell off after the ASB and his numbers are by far the worst of that group, but the games played discrepancy is MASSIVE.  I put Curry because if he played even 15 more games he would have been on the 1st team, and Golden State was not as dominant without him.  Chris Paul was astoundingly impressive with his 3.53 ATO ratio and nearly identical WS/48 to curry.  The rockets were 47-7 with Paul and significantly less dominant without him, despite still having the MVP and a high caliber supporting cast.  He was also responsible for the second most points per game behind only curry of the group. Kyrie is a very tough leave off because of how efficient he was along with the team success.  However, as we’ve seen in the last few weeks, Boston can still win games against even the best teams.  This was the main reason I opted to leave him off. Again, of the first 4 guards and the 4 I compared statistically, I can see arguments for any combination of 6 out of those 8 with only Harden, Lillard and Oladipo being required.  

**For** the forward spots I’m totally cheating.  Butler played most of his minutes as SG and Aldridge at C, but I don’t care about how the play by play classifies them.  Butler is a wing and LaMarcus has the exact same game he always has.  I don’t really feel bad putting him at PF and Jokic at C.  

**Let’s** get Butler out of the way first.  When he played, Minnesota was on pace to win 50 games.  Last year they went 31-51.  Towns, although better, isn’t *that* much better than last year.  The coach is the same, the team is basically the same, Butler was the difference.  And although a tiny sample size, without Jimmy, the wolves are on a 32 win pace…almost identical to last year.  For someone to make that big of a difference, I have to put them on the all nba team.  Butler was also a great leader for this team.  He didn’t care about stats.  One night he would have 17 points, 5 steals and 7 assists if Towns was going off.  Other nights he’d score 30.  That’s exactly what kind of player you need on a team with a ton of talent, lots of mouths to feed and is young.  If he stayed healthy and Minnesota was in contention for the 3rd or 4th seed, I don’t think I could put him over Durant, but he would deserve at least some consideration.  Combine all this with him being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, he’s a no brainer. 

**Aldridge** is getting some love later in the year and rightfully so.  The Kawhaiisis and not having that great of a supporting cast weren’t ideal as far as situation goes and there were plenty of games Aldridge won by himself.  His defense is also by far the best it’s been in his career imo.  If you insist on putting him at center I could see an argument over towns, I just like how the teams look the way I slotted them in.  

**For Jokic**, here’s how he compares to his competitors at center.  https://i.imgur.com/mCY1KtE.png . I think Towns is kind of in a class by himself in this group, and Horford, although great I just can’t put him over Jokic or Gobert.  Jokic is god tier offense and Gobert is god tier defense.  In the end, Jokic played quite a few more games and all other things being equal, I think that gives him an edge.  Jokic had any number of 33-15-12 games and did a whole lot for the nuggets offense which currently ranks 9th in FG%, 4th in 3p% and 5th in assists.  

Players that were extremely tough to leave off: Kyrie, DeRozan, Gobert, Horford

Players that got at least some consideration: Steven Adams, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Clint Capela, CJ McCollum, Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell, Lou Williams, Andre Drummond, Kemba Walker

###Defensive Player of the Year

**1. Anthony Davis**

This was an extremely tough year between Davis, Embiid, and Gobert.  Both the Jazz and the 6ers had better defenses than the Pelicans, and Davis did have Jrue playing good defense, but the Pels are remarkably worse with him off the floor.  He led the league in blocked shots and was great around the rim and on the perimeter.  One of the reasons I put him 1st is that I feel he could make a similar defensive impact on any team in the NBA.  Put gobert on a team that already has a Deandre Jordan type guy and I’m not sure he could be quite as effective.  With Davis, I feel like you can put him anywhere on the court and he just terrifies the offense.  It’s often funny watching guards go into the paint with davis on the floor.  They don’t often go to the basket, they quite frequently get to the elbow, see the Brow, then start moving laterally and take a leaning fader just so as not to get their shit blocked into the 8th row.  I think he has the best and quickest hands on defense of the 3 and he played the most games.  Honestly, between these three its so close I really have to go off eye test.  I mean, Davis is first in Defensive Win shares, but last in DBPM of the 3, he has the most steals and blocks but is last in rebound percentage and his team had the worst defense of the 3.  

**2. Rudy Gobert**

Gobert had almost 1 fewer foul per 36 than Embiid, and a higher block percentage, steal percentage and an almost identical rebound percentage.  His DBPM is drastically higher and he played fewer games than embiid, but it’s not that great of a difference in games played.  The biggest reason I put gobert ahead of embiid is that Utah was 12-15 without him.  Gobert doesn’t do much for the offense so that massive gap in winning percentage with vs without him in the western conference is due to his defense.  The Jazz are currently 3rd in the league in opponents points per 100 and while philly is 17th.  

**3. Joel Embiid**

I could see Embiid winning this award and would have no problem with it.  The nerdy guy I don’t like that much on the Dunc’d on podcast has picked him as the DPOY over every quarter this year.  He is a terror at the rim but also a terror on the perimeter.  He’s surprisingly nimble and I went to one Philly game this year and he’s fucking **HUGE**.  He fouls maybe a tiny bit too much and Philly down the stretch has been strong (albeit playing the leagues garbage dump) along with the small differences in the advanced stats I mentioned are the tiny nitpicks on why he’s 3rd and not 1st.  Overall, I think it’s absolutely a 3 man race especially with Roberson going down earlier.  I thought PG was the best perimeter defender this year, but these 3 make a bigger impact on the game defensively and that’s why they’re the top 3.   


###All defensive 1st team

*Danny Green* *Marcus Smart* *Paul George* *Anthony Davis* *Joel Embiid*

###All defensive 2nd team

*Victor Oladipo* *Jimmy Butler* *Giannis Antetokoumpo* *Draymond Green* *Rudy Gobert*

**I guess** playing in San Antonio is why Danny Green doesn’t get enough credit, but damn he is so good.  San Antonio has the 6th best opposing FG% and the 5th best opposing 3-point FG%.  And let me tell you, parker and ginobili are not the reason for that.  Aldridge has been great as well, and while being less athletic than a paralyzed hippopotamus, Pau Gasol actually has pretty good rim protection numbers.  With Kawhi out, Danny picks up the best opposing wing a large amount of the time and I give him credit by putting him on the first team.

**Marcus Smart** is absolutely incredible on defense and is perfectly suited to this era as he can play great D on 4s and 5s in a pinch.  That’s probably the difference maker on why he made 1st vs 2nd team.  His ability to not only lock down a guard, but also very much annoy and do a good job on bigs if need be is a highly sought after skill and it shows in Boston’s incredible defense this year.  If there was a 3rd team all defense I almost certainly would have put Jaylen Brown and Horford on there, but I think smart was the best defender and was very close to putting JB and Al on the 2nd team.  

**Paul George** was the best perimeter defender for most of the year.  The thing about PG is he plays both styles of defense at a high level.  What I mean by that is when playing your man on the perimeter, you can basically approach it both ways.  You can get really up close and basically harass them, poking at the ball, constantly changing position, or you can stay in between the basket.  The 1st way leads to more steals and is “sexier,” but the 2nd way is just as effective, you basically try to beat your opponent to the spot they want to get to.  George is very good at both and with jimmy missing quite a few games and Kawhi out, I thought he was the best perimeter defender this year.  Giannis has a higher ceiling with his 38 meter wing span, but his defensive IQ isn’t quite as good yet.  His offense has been quite bad and that’s why he didn’t sniff an all-NBA spot, but I think the defensive 1st team is warranted.  

*For davis, embiid and gobert see the DPOY section.*  

**Oladipo** replaced Paul George as the Pacers’ best defender and holy cow this surprised me even more than his 3 point shooting.  I guess it shouldn’t be that much of a surprise given his body and his athleticism, but I was shocked he would be *this* good on defense. The pacers had an elite 3P% defense and was 3rd in causing turnovers per 100 possessions and Oladipo leading the league in steals was a big part of that.  

**Jimmy Butler** was a no brainer to make one of the teams, especially with Kawhi not playing at all this year.  He missed quite a few games so I’m putting him on the 2nd team, and while Jaylen Brown got serious consideration for this spot, I thought Butler did so much more for Minnesota’s defense.  The wolves were dead last in FG% and 2P% but *only* 21st in 3 P% and 5th in causing turnovers per 100.  Despite a trash defense, I thought Butler did as good a job as you could ask for, especially considering that he and Taj Gibson are the only players that consistently played the slightest bit of defense this year.  If you were to give this spot to Horford or Brown to reward Boston, I wouldn’t have a big problem.  

**Giannis** is at times, jaw droppingly good on the defensive end of the floor. He’s gotten much stronger and with his wingspan, he can consume opponents with his shadow alone.   There were plenty of moments where you watch him and youre like, “yeah, that guy is still just 24 and doesn’t 100% know what hes doing” but most of the time you’re like “Jesus Christ, trying to go by that guy is my worst nightmare!”  The Bucks didn’t really have a stellar defense this year, but I blame that on the “coaching” staff.  In most years, Giannis could make the 1st team and most certainly will in the future, but for now, I’m putting him on the second team despite his defensive “ceiling” being higher than PG.  

**Draymond** has been fat, out of shape, hungover, ejected, and overall underwhelming this year.  And he’s still on my 2nd team.  He just does so many things for that team, who had a pretty good defense again this year.   He can still guard nearly anyone in the NBA and switch on anyone, block Dennis smith at the rim, then guard the best bigs in the league later in the week.  I almost left him off, but he is unassailably one of the best 10 defenders in the league so I gave him this spot over the two aforementioned Celtics.  

Really tough players to leave off: Horford, Jaylen Brown, Steven Adams, Roberson, Aldridge, Covington, Jrue Holiday

Players that got some consideration: Ben Simmons, Clint Capela, LMAM, Ariza, Tucker, Nurkic, James Johnson, Kevin Durant, Lowry, Klay


###Rookie of the Year

**1. Donovan Mitchell**

It’s him vs Simmons and they both deserve it.  If I had it my way all the voters would collude and agree that exactly half would vote for each so they are guaranteed to get co rookies of the year.  It was deserved in 94 with Hill and Kidd and its deserved now.  Gun to my head, I have to go with Mitchell because he’s in the western conference, is a true rookie, was relied more on in crunch time to make a basket, and was the best player on his team this year.  Gobert helped a ton defensively, as did Embiid, but Embiid could generate offense by himself while Gobert couldn’t.  I had the Jazz out of the playoffs before the year (RIP grizzlies), and Mitchell propelled them to a top 4 seed in the west.  Simmons is probably the better player and my guess would be he has the better individual career, but if I *had* to pick one for rookie of the year I’m taking Donovan.  

**2. Ben Simmons**

Great BBIQ, great passing, unselfishness, defense, energy, there really isn’t much more you could ask for from Simmons this year.  It’s not his fault he’s not the best player on his team and it’s not his fault Utah lost Hayward to Boston and Gobert for a reasonable chunk of the year, but it’s these tiny things that are the difference makers.  His triple doubles are impressive, but to me the most impressive aspect of his rookie year was his defense.  He was able and willing to guard multiple positions night in night out, which historically, just isn’t something rookies do.  He doesn’t have a jump shot, but I could care less.  As long as he has shooters around him the offense will hum.  It’s really hard to run an offense in the NBA and he stepped in seamlessly.  This is one of the better rookie campaigns of the last 20 years and he deserves a massive amount of credit.  He also has an Australian accent so if you wanna give him ROY just for that I can’t blame you.  

**3. Jayson Tatum**

Tatum has an array of offensive moves already and is an excellent shooter.  He had a bit of a slump (rookie wall or “I just had a baby” wall) but being such an integral part of a top 2 seed in the eastern conference cannot be ignored.  He probably wins ROY 7 years out of 10, but for 2018, he’ll have to settle for 3rd.  

###Most Improved Player

**1. Victor Oladipo**

Not much to say here that hasn’t already been said.  This should be a unanimous award.

**2. Joe Ingles**

MIP is a tough award as its hard to see a difference between actually improving as  a player, or simply getting a better opportunity.  I used per 36 numbers for most of my comparisons even though I typically hate per36.  The minutes difference is just too much and its still a player vs themselves comparison so this is one of the few times I find it appropriate.  I chose not to put any sophmores in MIP as nearly every rookie improves, often stoutly.  If I did, I would have voted for Jaylen Brown and either Brandon Ingram or Jamal Murray.  But on to Ingles.  The reason he gets 2nd on this ballot is because despite an uptick in usage and roll/minutes, his efficiency improved across the board.  Jingle McCringleberry improved his FG, eFG, FT, 3p, and TS percentages from last season.  Here’s a comparison to some other MIP candidates. https://i.imgur.com/w0sPWW3.png .  To be on a top 4/5 seed in the west and improve your volume *and* efficiency is extremely tough to do.  He’s also everyone’s favorite player, so here is Joe Ingles, 2018 MIP runner up.  

**3. Spencer Dinwiddie**

This was a really tough choice between him and Capela.  Capela improved his rebounding and shot blocking, led the league in FG% and was a fantastic defender this year.  However, this award is not for best player, it’s for most improved. Despite his decrease in efficiency in every part of his game, Dinwiddie was 6th in total assists this year, and had an incredible ATO ratio.  My reservations about putting him on here was that he could be a good stats bad team guy, which I generally don’t reward, but despite not being efficient, he adds value to the team and his advanced metrics have improved.  



###Coach of the Year

**1. Brad Stevens**

Coach of the year is hard to vote on.  Is it best system? Best record? Best job with a subpar cast?  Coach you would most want for your playoff team? Who knows.  All I know is there’s no fucking way you can be in contention for the top seed while getting 60/164 games from your top 2 players.  Stevens developed this team to be incredible on the defensive end of the floor and racked up a win streak, wins against the best teams, and a stunning road record.  On top of all of this, I believe there are only 4 players that were on the roster last year!  This was Casey’s award up until a few weeks ago, but the wizardry of this youthful basketball savant cannot be ignored.   

**2. Dwane Casey**

I left DeRozan off the all-NBA team because I give most of the credit for Toronto’s success to their improved coaching, system and bench play.  Nobody had the Raptors winning as many games as the Warriors this year, and to completely change their style of play and be elite on offense and defense (until the last 3 weeks), is incredibly hard to pull off.  We all have our reservations about the little dinosaurs, but Casey deserves a huge amount of credit for what he did this year.  

**3. Mike D’Antoni**

I’m not seeing many people voting for PringlesBro, and I’m not sure why.  It’s really hard to make two ball dominant players work together (see Brooks, Scott circa 2012-2015).  But D’Antoni turned two Harden and Paul into the best backcourt in the NBA.  Their playstyle is hard to watch, but even harder to defend.  No one had them being 6 games ahead of the warriors with the 1 seed locked up by April 1st.   


Coaches that got serious consideration: Snyder, Stotts, Pop



###Sixth Man of the Year

**1. Lou Williams**

This should be another unanimous award, Lou put a trash team on his back and kept them in playoff contention until the very end, despite losing CP3 and Blake.  His 50 point dicking he slapped on the Warriors sealed the award up imo.  

**2. Nikola Mirotic**

This year, Mirotic was traded from the bulls for being too good and made massive contributions to the Pelicans without Boogie.  Seriously, you have to put the man on the ballot.  HE WAS TRADED FOR BEING TOO GOOD AT BASKETBALL!  He had an 18.3 PER and averaged nearly 18/10 per 36 for New Orleans.  Down the stretch he has been huge especially with his 28 points on 6/11 from 3 in their win in Oracle.  

**3. Jordan Clarkson**

Clarkson didn’t really miss a beat switching teams mid season.  His percentages went up a bit when he went to Cleveland which is no surprise (.458/.392/.804).  From watching Clarkson, even though he seems to have an “all I do is score” mentality, I really like him on the floor.  He can create off the dribble and knock down tough shots, he’s not afraid of the moment and always brings the energy.    

Note that I restricted my 6th men to starting a maximum of 20 games, so other quality candidates such as Will Barton did not qualify.  


###All Rookie Teams

**1st Team**

*Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Kyle Kuzma, Bam Adebayo*

**2nd Team**

*Lonzo Ball, Lauri Markkanen, ~~Frank Ntilikina~~, Josh Jackson, OG Anunoby, John Collins*

Honestly, Im 5500 words in and don’t feel these need much justification.  No one really cares about 2nd team all rookie.  Good job I guess.

.

Well there you have it, hope you made it all the way through, let me know what you agree/disagree with. 


Edit: Josh Jackson over Frank seems pretty universal so I'll say I was wrong on that one. As far as ROY, please at least read the post. I said they should be co winners. The biggest reasons I voted for Donovan were his crunch time scoring, a top 4 seed in a tough western conference, and he was the best player on his team. As far as other selections, as I stated, some were VERY difficult decisions. Derozan and kyrie could be as high as 2nd team and I would have no problem with it. Horford and brown were close to making all defensive and DPOY was a 3 way coin flip. I'm sorry if my picks weren't the same as yours or I didn't vote for your team, but I think I provided ample justification for my selections.",0.49,controversial,2018-04-09 19:16:32

How can a player who shot 19 times, mostly in the paint, only have one FTA, but another player who only shot 3 times within the arc have 15 FTA? The foul-baiting works great for him, but it makes him an absolute unbearable star to watch/appreciate. I think he's got MVP this year if he doesn't slow down but I can't imagine cheering for that playstyle.

Overall, the Nuggets had 60 points in the paint and shot 21 free throws (more than 10 in the second half), while the Rockets had 32 points in the paint and shot 34 free throws (almost all in the first half).

I'm not a fan of holistic stats but if you do he's thriving by all metrics: he's first in both WS and WS/48, his PER is 27.7 and he's 3rd in OBPM and 4th in VORP.

He's also only rarely mentioned in the MVP discussion on this sub or the other NBA forums I frequent, and usually as an afterthought. What gives, /r/nba? I know people love to fetishize scoring and people are going to (wrongly) penalize Paul for not giving you 20ppg, but to me MVP is a three-man race by now between Curry, Gasol, and Paul, and the idea that anyone could have him not only outside the top 5, but the top *fifteen* is absolutely absurd to me. Of the 3-4 Clips games I watched he's been consistently fantastic, so unless the selection of games I watched was incredibly disproportionate this isn't a case of the numbers lying, either. LAC is 13-5, Paul is playing incredibly, he's been the consensus 3rd best player in the league for years... why have we suddenly forgotten about him completely?

2. Stroke the popular opinions ego- Even if you don’t agree with the opinion, you must always go with the popular narrative that is currently being spewed. This sub isn’t open to discussion, that is how you get downvoted.

3. “Lol” - This ones tricky, if you use this in the wrong context people will automatically downvote because they think you’re making fun of said opinions. Use wisely, preferably for outlandish takes. 

4. “(Blank) and it’s not even close” - This phrase isn’t liked by a majority of the community, if you use it, use it for concrete facts. Try not to use it when discussing players of similar caliber cause you’ll get downvoted. 

5. Talking about Lebron being bad/good- This will either get you a lot of downvotes or some upvotes depending on which side of the coin you choose. This subs kind of bipolar so careful.

6. “It’s not too late to delete this” - For when people say some stupid takes. It’s easy upvotes if you choose the takes to use it on carefully. 

7. “Nephew” - This term is used for when  someone can’t figure out an argument to say back to the person that they’re calling a nephew. So instead they resort to name calling. Will usually get upvotes. 

8. Know your context and stick with it - You need to pick and choose your battles, calling (blank) trash on a (blank) highlight reel/ appreciation post probably isn’t the smartest thing to do.

I'll start:

Kobe Bryant was nothing more than glorified DeMar DeRozan. He was a very gifted mid-range scorer and athlete, who benefitted from being in the right place in the right time, playing with Shaq and having Phil Jackson as a coach. His 08 MVP and 10 FMVP are total farces and his legacy is bolstered by these undeserved awards.

NBA players today would fare *much much better* in the past than players from the past would today. The athletes today are bigger, stronger, and faster than they were before. Wings like Lebron, KD, Giannis and Kawhi are all nearly the same size as even the most intimidating bigs like Bill Laimbeer. They would adapt to the physicality of the league and, with their combination of speed and strength, become totally unfair. It's pointless to compare players across eras in terms of how good they were at basketball (today's players are clearly better than any other era) and instead compare them by how they performed relative to the rest of the league.

Anybody with Sportscenter within shouting distance knows that the officiating in the NBA this playoffs has been a complete joke. Why would the NBA *intentionally* sacrifice the credibility of the Finals to... make the Finals more interesting? 

3. There's easier, more subtle ways to rig games that don't **literally** have an official system in place (replay) to scrutinize every decision made by the people trying to rig. Ever heard of bribing people? ""Hey, Chris Paul! If you give up a bunch of turnovers this game we'll make sure you get a ring next year!"" Boom. Simple.

So as the story goes essentially all of Kawhi's defensive metrics (RPM, defensive on/off, tracking dEFG%, synergy sports metrics) have [slipped](http://i.imgur.com/ge618Ee.png) hard this season. While Occam's razor gives us a simple explanation for that - his defense has slipped somewhat - many people on this sub like to throw out, without any critical evaluation, this [piece](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/) by Matt Moore in Kawhi's defense. The piece alleges that opposing teams' offenses take the best wing player on the opposing team who is being guarded by Kawhi out of their offense to play 4 on 4 against a bunch of ""bad defenders"" like Gasol or Parker.

There are a few things wrong with the piece.

1) It gives out its conclusion almost at the start:

*""After all, we know Leonard is a great defender.""* 

and

*All this suggests that it is not Leonard's teammates who are dragging him down, but the other way around. If you want at least some variation of a bottom line, in individual defense, Leonard is only 53rd percentile via Synergy Sports. He was 86th percentile last season.

So we've reached an impasse. We know Leonard is an elite defender. We know he's still locking up whoever he is facing. So how do we explain these numbers, the somewhat small sample size notwithstanding?*

- and then it sets out to prove it. That's of course circular reasoning which isn't something you would want to employ while trying to prove something.

2) The evidence is flimsy. The article shows 11 possessions from 3 games as an evidence of teams avoiding Kawhi. The problem of course is that you can't generalize those few videos on the whole season, unless you want me to generalize stuff like [this](https://vine.co/v/5QJgL7rviBj) on a whole season too. The opposing teams practice for 5 on 5. Players like LeBron or Durant don't take themselves out of the offenses that are built around them because of Kawhi. No teams do that. That's an asinine assumption proven wrong by the eye test.

If you watch the Spurs games, it becomes pretty clear that the opposing offenses are not avoiding Kawhi. In fact per nba.com's Defense tracking he is defending 9.2 FGAs per game this season as opposed to 9.4 FGAs last season in what is essentially the same number of minutes per game so you can't really claim that the offenses are avoiding him. The difference? Last year his opponents shot 5.6% lower than their season averages on those shots defended by Kawhi, while this season the only shoot 1.3% lower.

3) The piece tries to wiggle around with various line-up explanations but it ultimately fails to prove why the Spurs defense gets so much better without Kawhi on the floor and with those purported ""bad defensive"" players still on the floor. Do teams suddenly start playing 5 on 5? Shouldn't the reincorporation of their best wing into offense result in a better offense, especially if a worse defender that Kawhi has subbed in for him? The opposite happens though, the offenses get 9 points worse. This causes the whole piece to essentially fall apart.

So I maintain that Kawhi's defense has actually declined somewhat. It's still pretty good and will probably be back to its usual level in the playoffs, but it's not on the DPOY level of the previous few years like some people still claim. I'll try to give some reasons:

1) More offensive responsibilities - this one is pretty clear. Just like the Spurs defense gets better without Kawhi, their offense goes down by pretty much the same margin. Kawhi is taking 3 more shots per game than last years and overall has a far bigger role on the offensive side. He also, at least to me, seems to be isoing a little bit more than he used to and that can really take your strenght.

2) Timmy D's retirement - I would say that having a good rim protector can make a wing defender look better than they actually are (far more than the other way around) because it allows them to play closer to the ball handlers and contest their jumpshots better, knowing that the ball handler will be reluctant to drive into a good rim protector who can contain the blow-by. We have seen this with PG and Roy Hibbert when he was good for those 2 seasons. And I think we have see it with Kawhi and Timmy D too.

Timmy was of course an elite rim protector even in his later years and he could've probably won 2 DPOYs over the last 4 years without anyone being able to say anything about it. Having him behind you to cover your ass really helped a lot. Timmy is the guy who slowed down LeBron in those 2013 Finals, not Kawhi or Diaw, because LeBron feared driving into Timmy. Elite guys like LeBron or KD don't really even look at their primary defender, they mainly concern themselves with what the help defense is doing.

Without Timmy Kawhi was getting a little bit exposed, but his defensive metrics have started to rebound (they were worse than they are now at the time of Moore's piece) with the emergence of Dedmon as a solid rim protector. The question then of course is to whom do you attribute this improvement.

Of course I can be wrong and Kawhi's defense is as good as ever. In that case I maintain that the Moore article does a poor job of showing that.",0.52,controversial,2017-03-04 11:50:21

298,On Brandon Ingram,5,5u8lam,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5u8lam/on_brandon_ingram/,98,1487206032.0,"Edit: Thanks for the downvotes for providing a discussion...

First off, I'd like to say two disclaimers: 1) this isn't to trash on Ingram, it's more of a ""tell me why I'm wrong (or right)' post, and 2) I'm a Celtics fan, but I'm not trying to be biased against a Lakers player.

Anyway, I just want to know what scouts saw in him. I agree that he has potential, and it's unfair to judge him solely on his rookie season in terms of what type of player he'll develop into- but what does he have that about a half dozen other young players don't? I just don't see what makes him ""special"", I guess. I think he's obviously a first round NBA prospect that I would not be surprised if he blossoms into a good, or even great player. But what made him such a more highly regarded player than Jamal Murray or Jaylen Brown or even someone older like Buddy Hield or Malcolm Brogdon?

And I get that youth is in his favor. But there's other 19 year olds that seem to be on his talent level. He just seems like he'd be a hit or miss mid-first rounder that I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up being a legit player or ended up being a career bench warmer. If I said that, for example, Malik Beasley or Malachi Richardson or Timothe Luwawu-Cabbarot were struggling then nobody would bat an eye, and sort of write them off as players that probably won't make it. But it seems that Ingram gets the benefit of the doubt just because he was drafted number 2, and he's getting minutes (and he's probably getting those based on where they drafted him).

He doesn't seem to have any elite skills, and has a glaring weakness (being weak, in fact). So, people who know him more than I do: what makes Brandon Ingram special?",0.53,controversial,2017-02-15 16:47:12

AD can do basically everything. Embiid is a monster when healthy and actually being utilized. Kp is a scoring machine. A guy like Drummond can get you 20 and 15 every night.

But the one thing none of these guys really do is pass. They can pass if they need to, but they aren't looking to do it. 

The modern NBA is all about guards and forwards playing around the perimeter. Whenever a center or power forward who is the size of a center gets the ball, they are usually looking for their shot. 

AD, for all of his skill, rarely kicks the ball back out to a shooter when he gets doubled he just keeps working his shot unless he gets in trouble and has to give it up. 

But Jokic is different. He may not be as good as AD when it comes to scoring, but he actually looks to pass. He is very good at it too. He someone cuts, he will hit them with a bounce pass. If he gets doubled, he finds the open man. 

Give him a great second guy who is a perimeter player and I think you have the only lineup featuring a big that can lead to a championship.

MVP candidate, Triple Double Machine, Favourite son and apprentice of legends His Airness Michael ""Goat"" Jordan and Kobe ""Mamba"" ""Bryant, King of the Prairie, and unwitting pawn to bad publicity. 

Now I'm sure you've heard varying opinions on him, that he's a ball hog, ran KD out of OKC, the reason why OKC's dynasty fell through and a whole other bunch of fecal matter that people throw around like monkies. 

But is he really? First we have to know and understand his back story like the norm for all super heroes. 

Drafted as a defensive specialist with the 4th pick and considered a reach by most at the time and moved from his natural position of SG to PG this young guy with a chip on his shoulder trying to make it for both him and his dead friend had the unwanted pressure of adapting to a new role while trying to adapt to the nba.

Shouldering the blame of most of his teams bad publicity and mistakes, the young floor general along with his brothers in arm make it to the 2012 finals only to lose due to inexperience and LeBron James will to get his first ring. At the ages of 21 and 22 after trading James ""I need that 5mill"" Harden, the dynamic duo of Westbrook and Durant were expected to lead to a dynasty winning at least  1 to 3 rings during the decade. What went wrong? Was it really ball hogging? 

2013: they win 60 games and are favourites to win it that year, until Westbrook gets injured during the first round and misses half of the 2014 season.

2015: Durant goes down, thunder misses the playoffs by one game and people get a glimpse into the possibility that is westbrook.  Trying his best to will a team not built for him to a high standard he falls short.

2016: With the team finally healthy for the first time since 2013 playoffs and under new coaching leadership the OKC thunder over perform and find themselves up 3-1 in the WCF. We all know what happened so let's just fast forward a couple months.

having resigned and showing signs of loyalty to his team who have raised him since he was 19. The competitor proceeds to deliver a historic season willing his team to a playoff spot after preseason expectations were for him to go off and miss/barely make the playoffs. But still even amongst the respect put forward by players and coaches Westbrook is met with detractors trying to downplay his accomplishments.

Here, we have a 6'3"" PG drafted as a defensive specialist leading the league in scoring at 31ppg, 10.5rbs, 10.5ast.

With his team in the middle or a retool/rebuild he has his team sitting at a record of 42-31 after initial expectations were a losing record and a postseason being ""if they're lucky"". After reaching the WCF last year, his years team consist of 5 players who see minutes on the floor who have any playoff experience. 

Outside of Taj, Kanter and Westbrook all other rotation players are still on rookie contracts and they are fielding 3 rookies (one who started for most of the year). None of these rookies are top 10 picks either.

Outside of westbrook these 14 other players collectively boast a whopping 9 seasons averaging over 10.0ppg. And kanter and dipo are responsible for 6 of the 9. 

Now, dipo has missed 13 games, kanter has missed 10, and Adams was playing injured for around the first 30 games of the season. OK you say.. who cares? players miss games all the time. True... but other than the rookies these were the only players who had any off season training camp with westbrook. The rest of his team arrived during the season. 

The context is important when it comes to speaking about westbrook whether negatively  or positively. With limited offensive options the effect these have not being in the game is excruciating when it comes to notching wins. Now I'm not saying that with these guys being healthy that they would have 10-30 more wins, but maybe just maybe if you think about it, considering that his competition in the MVP race is only up 8 wins and 4 more wins would have them in the 4th seed,  you can't discount the possibilities of the context provided. 

Maybe someone can provide insight on other teams in the league whose roster consists of rookie contract players and see where they stand in the big picture because to me what westbrook is doing with what's been given to him is nothing short of amazing. After all, this is the Nba, where westbrook happens! and I think his detractors really need to take a step back and show some appreciation for the leagues MVP.",0.5,controversial,2017-03-28 22:25:47
313,"Honest questions regarding ""The Kick"" and the relevance of intent",0,4kqio1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4kqio1/honest_questions_regarding_the_kick_and_the/,72,1464070170.0,"When Draymond's shot to Adam's crotch first happened, the narrative was largely that Draymond tried to injure Adams in a fit of immaturity and classlessness. Even as a Warriors fan, I bought into this narrative, as I saw no other reason for his leg to do that on the play. It seemed he should be suspended.

Today the internet is flooded with [videos of other scenarios in which Draymond does the same kick on the finish](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFw0ls6oC36/), but in the absence of opponents' nuts. In my opinion, these videos go a long way to support the argument that the kick was unintentional, and that Adams's balls were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. Whether you still believe it was intentional or not, the r/nba narrative has also shifted to account for these videos. The story is no longer ""Draymond is dirty,"" and now reads ""intent shouldn't matter."" This, I can understand. If reckless movements are condoned on the court just because they are consistent, then there is nothing preventing actually dirty players from repeatedly flailing around and secretly hoping to occasionally cause injury or start fights.

However, if we throw intent out the window, then what distinguishes Draymond's kick from something like Westbrook's kick [here](https://gfycat.com/FairImpoliteIberianmole) or [here](https://gfycat.com/UnacceptableSelfishElephant)? It looks like Westbrook needlessly catches a sack in both gifs. Before today, I would have said the difference was intent. Westbrook was at worst trying to create separation between himself and Duncan in the first gif. In the second gif, it looks like he's desparately seeking a 4-point play. No intent there. But now Draymond's play might just be a bad flopping habit, and intent apparently doesn't matter anyways.

Is it that Adams went down to the ground and played less minutes, whereas Duncan was only momentarily in pain, and West seemed not to mind? In other words, is the degree of the injury relevant in this decision?

Is the argument that Westbrook's kicks were more natural than Draymond's? Is ""natural"" a binary classification for the NBA? Or are there various degrees of ""natural""?

I read some justifications of Dahntay Jones's suspension that cited his ""reputation"" as a dirty player. Is this actually something the NBA considers? And if so, who decides what this reputation is for Draymond or Westbrook? I feel that Draymond's reputation might have affected the extent to which this play blew up.

Anyways, I'm wondering in which ways this Draymond kick is unique to similar kicks if intention plays no part. I think any of the arguments I mentioned above could be made into valid arguments, and I'm interested to see what people have to say.",0.47,controversial,2016-05-23 23:09:30

None of this is to say that LeBron is not a ferocious competitor, or is not going to try his absolute best to win the title next year.

It sounds like a hot take, but it’s not. 

It’s the modern NBA, not 1980. Big men who can’t shoot, can’t assist, and (as it pertains to defense) CAN’T GUARD ANYONE BUT 4s AND 5s (AKA GOBERT), are not what you want as a franchise cornerstone.

Gobert regularly gets yanked in close games against teams that can space the floor and shoot.  I remember in the playoffs when Snyder had him sitting on the bench for crucial stretches against the Rockets. He only played 30 MPG against the Rockets in the playoffs last year, and the Jazz were often better with Derrick Favors at the 5 instead of him.

The playoffs are when you have your stars playing 36+ every game. But not Rudy, his coach can’t bare to play him more than 30 per. What good are you as a defensive player if you are unplayable in crunch time AGAINST ANY SINGLE TEAM? Imagine calling yourself the DPOY when you are flat out a negative contributor against elite teams.

Gobert is a bottom feeder, plain and simple! Can feast on teams with terrible spacing like the Knicks, but is useless or mid against actually good teams in the playoffs. **It’s why the Jazz never do anything in the playoffs despite having great regular season records.**


Gobert is

•	⁠66th in PPG (averaging fewer points than Serge Ibaka)

•	⁠167th in APG (fewer than Daniel Theis despite averaging 12 more MPG)

•	⁠2nd in RPG to Andre Drummond. Go ask Andre Drummond (new address: piss & concrete (sorry CLE bros but i had to)) how much rebounding meant to Detroit. He was literally traded for filler and a second round pick.

He’s a terrible scorer with no post moves who can’t shoot. He can’t pass whatsoever (averaging 1.2 APG).

All he can do is

* rebound

* catch lobs

* play paint defense

Oh shit, where have we seen this before? Oh right, DeANDRE JORDAN. A guy that casuals overrated *FOR YEARS* before he got dumped like a box of bricks from the Mavs and people realized that NBA GMs didn’t value him at all.

Like I feel like I’m watching a completely different player than everyone else. This dude is not a star. **He wins DPOYs because people still have an archaic mindset that DPOYs are people who block shots and protect the paint. WRONG. DPOYs should be people who stop shots from even occurring, forcing passes (look at Kawhi’s defense when he won it)**,

That’s where we felt we had the best chance to score.” Throwing shade at Harden & his defense. 

As we all know, James Harden prevented Giannis, Embiid, & Siakam from scoring and played excellent post defense. In fact, James Harden was so good on post up defense that he is currently ranked in the 95th percentile allowing only 26.8% FG% against him.

This can easily be cast aside as the “James Harden plays bad defense” narrative going into Giannis head. Which I understand, however Giannis also threw shade at Harden during his All Star Game Draft.

Giannis chose Kemba Walker over James Harden claiming he wanted someone who would “Pass the ball” 

Harden is currently averaging 7.3 Assists Per Game
Kemba is averaging 5.0 assists per game

Another fact Giannis seemed to ignore, but wait.. there’s even more shade!

Before selecting either Harden or Walker, Giannis stated he wanted the “Crossover Killer, Step-Back Master” things Harden is obviously known for with his step-back 3 & crossovers (sorry Rubio fans). He then went on to choose Kemba Walker over Harden throwing shade at him as well.

Now, many of you will say I’m thinking too much into this and that it isn’t that serious. That these are all just coincidences and jokes. However, I have one final piece of evidence.

Last year, Giannis threw a pass that eventually hit Harden in the head pretty hard. When looking back at it, he threw this pass extremely hard & fast at someone in the corner Harden was guarding. This hit Harden in the head, Giannis rebounded the ball, and didn’t even seem to care or think about what he did to Harden and continued to play. Most people brushed this off as an accident, i did too (as a rockets fan) however some are speculating Giannis did this on purpose and actually hates/dislikes Harden.

So.. I guess my question to you all is.. Do you think Giannis Antetokounmpo hates James Harden?

&nbsp;


In his ""Book of Basketball"" when he talks about the ABA recruiting of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he says that in the pitch meeting George Mikan (the ABA commissioner) just ""forgot"" that he had a check for $1,000,000 in his pocket to offer to Kareem. He also cited the book ""Loose Balls"" by Terry Pluto in his references.

&nbsp;


Well, I happened to have read Loose Balls before I read Book of Basketball, and I remember clearly, George Mikan did not forget about the check, he just ignored his colleagues demand to show Kareem the check in the first meeting.  You see, Kareem made it clear that he wasn't going to get into a back and forth negotiation. He was going to take whatever the bigger first offer was. And George Mikan, I suppose, just didn't believe him. He told his colleagues afterwards that he was going to show it to him at the next meeting, which of course, never transpired, much to the chagrin of his colleagues - which was also the beginning of the end for George Mikan as the ABA commisioner. 


&nbsp;



Small little detail, right? Bill Simmons just changed it slightly to make George Mikan appear more brainless.  Well, that's fine and dandy for one small thing, however - 


&nbsp;



The question it raises for me is - What else did he change in that book?  What other fact did he omit or change in order to rewrite basketball history?  It puts the integrity of the whole book, AND its author into question. 

____________________________________________________________________________________


Edit - 

From Loose Balls, as told by Mike Storen, then ABA executive:

&nbsp;

>We were all huddled in a hotel suite. Brown and Mikan went down the hall to meet Alcindor and they were in there for three and a half hours. They came out and I said, ""That check got us where we wanted to go, right?""

He has an ok jumper but his post game isn’t as good as a Joel Embiid and he was not in the top 20 for both offensive or defensive win shares. If you go for total win shares for the time he was active last season he’s 13th behind guys like Clint Capela and Vucevic. 

AD hasn’t won mvp, dpoy, or had much playoff success. 2 trips to the playoffs in 7 years and 5 won playoff games total in 7 years. Last season before AD quit, Jrue and Randle averaged 20 PPG+ and before the trading deadline Mirotic who is an elite sharpshooter averaged 16.5 I believe.

Another 10 days have gone by, all star starters announced, and this is my updated complete ranking list.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Player (change from last edition)|Comment||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Stephen Curry (same)|Curry isn't MVP but I do believe he's the best overall player in the NBA right now and keeps his number 1 ranking.||
|2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (same)|National media wise has taken a backseat to Harden but he's still right there for MVP race, and I would give it to him if season ended today.||
|3. James Harden (same)|I watched the full 61 point performance live and dude's on another level, but I agree with the national media narrative that his style of play will not sustain long term success in the playoffs.||
|4. Nikola Jokic (+4)|The consistency is starting to remain and Jokic is dominating. He should be the very clear 1st reserve pick for the all star team.||
|5. Joel Embiid (+6)|Him not playing vs. Denver honestly raised his value in my eyes, last night's game showed how important he is.||
|6. Kevin Durant (-1)|With KD (like LeBron) at this point I just expect him to go off in the playoffs. He finished number 1 last year (my final ranking includes playoffs) and he's very much in contention for that spot still.||
|7. Paul George (+2)|The all star starter nod gives him national recognition, and his play has equaled that consistently throughout the season.||
|8. Kawhi Leonard (-2)|The more the season progresses, the more I think he's going to LA. But the Raptors were my preseason pick to win the Finals and that could change things.||
|9. Kyrie Irving (+7)|Good last 10 days. All star starter, and he's by far the most unguardable guard in the East.||
|10. Anthony Davis (-6)|The closer we get to the break, I would not completely rule out a trade. But he's been number 1 this season before but with how stacked the talent at the top is him being here speaks to that.||
|11. Russell Westbrook (+4)|His efficiency has been better the last few games, Thunder winning, should be a clear all star reserve.||
|12. Karl-Anthony Towns (+2)|Last 3 games: 25/18/7, 27/12/5, 33/10/4. Dude is beasting.||
|13. LeBron James (-6)|He's coming back soon, he should finish higher than this when all said and done, but serious questions are starting to emerge. LeBron has made the NBA Finals every year since 2011. That's not happening this year and a Lakers 1st round exit is not out of question, what happens to his reputation (for this season) compared to other superstars if that occurs? It's something to keep in mind.||
|14. Bradley Beal (-2)|I thought he should have been a starter over Kemba, and he has turned himself into the Wizards' franchise centerpiece in a matter of literally weeks.||
|15. Damian Lillard (-2)|Overall I would say quietly having his best season.||
|16. Ben Simmons (+2)|I think he is a near lock for his 1st all star game. At just 22 years old that's nice.||
|17. Rudy Gobert (-7)|He's out of my top 10 but his consistency is enough for me to have him as an all star right now. He would be a very bad omission if left off.||
|18. Blake Griffin (-1)|BG is solid and the rest of the team needs work.||
|19. Jimmy Butler (same)|Despite all the drama, I think Butler is still an all star in the east.||
|20. Kyle Lowry (+2)|Arguably the best point guard in the league the first 3ish weeks but that's long in the past now. Still, overall on the season, he's in my top 20 right now.||
|21. Kemba Walker (-1)|I think he should have been a reserve but still him starting is good for the league.||
|22. LaMarcus Aldridge (+2)|I posted my all star reserves yesterday. One change: I now have Aldridge in over Klay for the 12th spot.||
|23. Donovan Mitchell (+11)|Biggest comeback of 2019 goes to him without question so far.||
|24. Klay Thompson (-3)|He's made 4 straight all star games, a 5th is in jeopardy. It's going to be very close.||
|25. Jrue Holiday (+3)|He keeps finding ways to stay in the elite mix. Although I don't have him in right now, he is a legitimate all star contender.||
|26. Victor Oladipo (+1)|The most unfortunate injury of the season so far.||
|27. DeMar DeRozan (-4)|He was an all star lock even a month ago, but now he's probably not getting in.||
|28. Jusuf Nurkic (+8)|Dude's on the rise. He isn't close to the scoring level as most players above him yet, but his IQ is near Jokic level. He'll have to play consistent to move up higher than this, as now that he's ranked here he has to prove it.||
|29. Steven Adams (-3)|Remains consistent and still a career season, I had him as an all star in late December but I'm going with no.||
|30. Luka Doncic (same)|In the East he would 110% be an all star. I wouldn't be totally surprised to see him get in the West but I think not this year.||
|31. Pascal Siakam (+7)|His consistent play is a big reason the Raptors have remained elite, and with how the East is shaped I believe he is an all star.||
|32. Khris Middleton (+1)|Middleton is currently my 12th pick for the East team. The top upvoted comment on NBA was saying Bledsoe deserves it over him. I disagree. Bledsoe looks like a top 20 overall player at times but he just doesn't keep that level of play consistent over a season. Middleton has played solid and consistent just about the whole season, and with how the East is I give him the all star nod right now.||
|33. CJ McCollum (-2)|If he were in the East, would be a serious all star candidate.||
|34. Draymond Green (-9)|Being more consistent on offense got him a top 25 spot 10 days ago. That consistency hasn't been there since last edition.||
|35. DeMarcus Cousins (NEW)|His fit with Golden State is even better than expected, he takes this team to a new dimension.||
|36. Mike Conley (+6)|As a Grizzlies fan, I would prefer to keep him to Gasol. For the love of humanity even with a tank watching the Shelvin Mack show the last 2 months would be too much.||
|37. Jayson Tatum (-2)|Not quite an all star this year, but my early bet is he will be in 2020.||
|38. Al Horford (+3)|Dude's been playing consistent, clutch and his impact has gone up in 2019.||
|39. Clint Capela (-10)|Injured and value down, which is unfortunate because the way he was playing pre injury he was trending to be a serious all star candidate by now.||
|40. Andre Drummond (-8)|I hate using the term ""empty stats"" and Drummond is very talented, but for 2019 that term is appropriate at times.||
|41. Julius Randle (-4)|Quiet last 10 days, but as I said in my reserve article I would pick him as an all star over Tobias Harris if it came down to those 2.||
|42. Tobias Harris (+4)|Good player, small progression from last season, I don't think he's an all star. He plays better against bad teams than playoff contenders, one of the weirdest players to rank all season.||
|43. John Wall (-3)|Him being 72nd in fan voting wow. His clout took a 180||
|44. Nikola Vucevic (+6)|The Lakers giving up assets for Vucevic is probably a mistake, but I do think he would fit well next to LeBron.||
|45. Buddy Hield (+9)|His consistency and impressive scoring ability gives him a nice bump to the top 45. Very impressive season.||
|46. Domantas Sabonis (-7)|He's been consistent but..from analyzing him a little more that's maybe not always in important clutch situations.||
|47. Serge Ibaka (+2)|Has scored in double figures 12 straight games.||
|48. Eric Bledsoe (+5)|A 40% 3 point shooting Eric Bledsoe would be a top 20 overall player.||
|49. Malcolm Brogdon (+6)|He might get the award for most consistent player on the year. Makes an unexpected jump into the top 50 with 16/5/3 averages and great efficiency. The Bucks join Warriors/Raptors as only teams with 4 top 50 players. As a matter of fact, the Warriors/Raptors/Bucks have 25% of all top 50 players.||
|50. John Collins (-2)|Still playing impressive enough to keep his top 50 spot.||
|51. Myles Turner (-6)|You would like to see him take over with Oladipo now out, we'll see what happens.||
|52. Chris Paul (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|53. Devin Booker (-6)|In 2019 Booker is shooting 31% from 3 point land, the Suns are a mess, I understand he doesn't have much to work with just an unfortunate situation all around.||
|54. Lou Williams (-2)|Congrats on 1st triple double.||
|55. Marc Gasol (+3)|If we are looking at the last few days of Gasol in Memphis it's been a good 10+ years.||
|56. De'Aaron Fox (-12)|Since last edition he's shooting 37% from the field.||
|57. Thaddeus Young (+3)|23/15 against the Raptors shows just how good this guy is. Consistently helps the Pacers win, finished 63rd last season and is even higher than that right now.||
|58. Jamal Murray (-7)|As I've said all year if he can consistently play like he can when on, a top 25 player.||
|59. DeAndre Jordan (-3)|As is the case with Drummond, he feels like an ""empty stats"" guy sometimes.||
|60. Montrezl Harrell (-1)|He's remained consistent off the bench the whole season, a near lock for a top 100 finish and probably top 75 minimum.||
|61. Danilo Gallinari (-4)|Injured and value down.||
|62. D'Angelo Russell (+13)|Since January 2 he's up 40 overall spots. No player in the league is making a serious name for himself at a quicker rate.||
|63. Kyle Kuzma (+1)|Around this part in the ranking, a theme emerges where the talent =/ consistency.||
|64. Zach LaVine (-3)|Despite the Bulls' mess, he is unquestionably having himself a very good season.||
|65. DeAndre Ayton (-3)|With Ayton injured we get to watch the Dragan Bender show.||
|66. Aaron Gordon (+3)|22/11/6 vs. Wizards last game was good.||
|67. JJ Redick (+3)|Consistently getting buckets still.||
|68. Josh Richardson (-3)|Talented, makes impressive plays, but right now this is a more appropriate ranking than the 54th he was at January 2.||
|69. Derrick Rose (-3)|It's been a slow last 10 days.||
|70. Andrew Wiggins (+1)|He's not a bust. Below expectations sure, but not a bust.||
|71. Robert Covington (-8)|Still injured, value down.||
|72. Spencer Dinwiddie (+12)|The injury is unfortunate, but he at least played well enough to where it's highly unlikely he falls out of the top 100 (or even top 90) before he comes back.||
|73. Joe Ingles (-1)|Playing well in his role, just not being asked as much in terms of scoring.||
|74. Paul Millsap (-7)|He's not where he was at pre getting injured for 3 weeks but still top 75.||
|75. Brandon Ingram (-7)|I would seriously consider trading him.||
|76. Hassan Whiteside (+3)|22/16 vs. the Clippers was good. But not enough of those type games.||
|77. Gary Harris (-4)|He's looked good the last few games, just needs to build momentum.||
|78. Willie Cauley-Stein (-4)|""He doesn't contribute to winning basketball"" well he's started every game this season for an above .500 Kings team and has scored in double figures 11 of the last 12 games. He did move down, but a ""so overrated he's underrated"" player.||
|79. Jerami Grant (+1)|What a season for him so far. Very impressed.||
|80. Brook Lopez (+5)|Up 13 spots since January 2. Good to see him have a nice bounce back year.||
|81. Bojan Bogdanovic (same)|He's going to be asked to have a more prominent role with Oladipo out, interested to see what happened.||
|82. Jarrett Allen (+8)|Up 17 spots since January 2. You'd like to see more offensive consistency but this man has some seriously scary potential.||
|83. Darren Collison (+6)|15/7 on 47% shooting last 5 games.||
|84. Marcus Morris (-6)|One of my favorite role players in the entire league, but the claim I witnessed yesterday saying he deserves an all star spot over Tatum/Horford is just absurd.||
|85. Jonas Valanciunas (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|86. Bogdan Bogdanovic (-3)|A little inconsistent (followed up 16/9/8 with being shut down by Memphis) but clearly a top 100 talent this year.||
|87. Kevin Love (-10)|Still injured, value down. But that injury has taken a huge hit to his value at this point.||
|88. Marcus Smart (+5)|Up 17 spots since January 2. Shooting 44% from 3 in 2019 is a stat I would never in a million years believe to be something Marcus Smart could do.||
|89. Al-Farouq Aminu (+10)|This dude put up 17/8/4 with a broken pinky. But also one of the more underrated players overall this season. He finished 112th last season, his chances of a final top 100 spot are decent right now||
|90. Derrick Favors (-5)|Consistently playing well enough to hang on to a top 100 spot.||
|91. Danny Green (+7)|Very impressive game on national TV vs. Houston.||
|92. Harrison Barnes (-10)|Last 5 games: 32% from the field.||
|93. Jaylen Brown (-1)|It's been a 3rd year slump, but he's been able to hang on to a top 100 spot the whole season.||
|94. Otto Porter Jr (+2)|I think he could thrive in a different situation.||
|95. Nikola Mirotic (-8)|His impressive start to the season is keeping him in the top 100 for now, just unfortunate injury situation with him.||
|**96. Justise Winslow (+5)**|101st 10 days ago, Winslow cracks the top 100 for the first time ever. Well deserved and it's been incredible to see his steady progression.||
|97. Dwyane Wade (-3)|Wade keeps his top 100 spot, he's in veteran role but he still makes impressive plays.||
|98. Dennis Schroder (-1)|Schroder makes 5 top 100 players for the Thunder currently.||
|99. Ricky Rubio (-4)|Despite the quiet season, Rubio barely hangs on to his top 100 spot.||
|100. TJ Warren (-9)|Warren edges Lauri Markkanen for the final top 100 spot currently. His shooting performance this season has been impressive (and he's higher than his 106 finish last season) but the league continues to expand in depth and he's now injured for 2-3 weeks.||

338,"James Harden scored 41 points on 15-35 (43%) shooting and was criticized for his poor efficiency, Kyrie Irving scored 40 points on 17-33 (51%) shooting and is called clutch and underrated. Is that 8% the difference between an MVP-like performance and a bad one?",4,a9kl3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a9kl3h/james_harden_scored_41_points_on_1535_43_shooting/,45,1545819723.0,"Hi, everyone. I'm making this thread cause I'm genuinely curious about what exactly the stigma is against James Harden. He and Kyrie Irving had very similar performances today:

||PTS|REB|AST|TO|STL|BLK|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|James Harden|41|6|7|6|2|1|
|Kyrie Irving|40|10|3|2|1|0|

Both won their respective games, both had 4th quarter game saving-performances, but one performance is regarded as far more superior than the other. Is it because James Harden had no choice, but to chuck the ball without Chris Paul playing? I mean, James Harden had a 41 point game against a Top 5 NBA defense without another player on his team scoring over 20 points. Should that be considered in the conversation? Kyrie Irving had two other teammates score over 20  (Marcus Morris and Jayson Tatum both scored 23) and they barely beat a mid-tier defensive team by 7. *I dunno what to think anymore*. I seem to be in the minority now when it comes to unbiasedly dissecting Harden's games. 

Don't get me wrong, both of these performances were stellar, I just think Harden's was a little more impressive especially since it was against a defensively experienced Thunder team that had won 4 of their last 5 with incredible performances from Paul George.

What do you guys think?",0.52,controversial,2018-12-26 02:22:03
339,Why is there this narrative that MJ didn't have nearly as much help as guys today when he played with one of the best 2 way forwards of all time and the greatest rebounder in modern NBA history?,4,7v6xno,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7v6xno/why_is_there_this_narrative_that_mj_didnt_have/,88,1517782557.0,Not to mention rodman was no slouch on defense either. Dudes team was stacked. I'm not taking away from Jordan as a player or his accomplishments I'm simply asking why people use this as an argument against guys like LBJ or even KD when discussed. I guess it could have something to do with those guy already being established superstars and joining stacked teams coupled with the media of today's NBA but still when just looking at talent and talent alone I'd say Jordans team is more stacked than any lebron team but obviously not KDs Warriors,0.52,controversial,2018-02-04 14:15:57
340,Stan Van Gundy's incredible coaching tonight,0,7ik0kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7ik0kx/stan_van_gundys_incredible_coaching_tonight/,30,1512815699.0,"I'd like to personally congratulate Stan on his amazing coaching down the stretch against the Warriors tonight. With the Pistons down two and with the ball with a chance to tie or win, he let them freelance and didn't call a time out to write up a play. The freelance failed and then the warriors made two more free throws to put the Pistons down 4. After this, Stan decides to call a time out with 5 seconds left down 4 instead of calling it when they were down 2. I can only think he was writing up a miraculous 4 point play in that timeout because of the incredible genius that he is. Thanks for that display of amazing coaching Stan.",0.48,controversial,2017-12-09 02:34:59
341,Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn't get enough criticism as an MVP for his performance in the 2019 ECF.,11,hspux3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hspux3/giannis_antetokounmpo_doesnt_get_enough_criticism/,90,1594991536.0,"When's the last time we've seen an MVP player fall that hard in the playoffs? I wanna start this post by saying I don't think Giannis was THAT bad in that series, but his underperformance cannot go understated. He started off the series hot, scoring 24 and 30 in the first 2 games on good shooting, but fell off a cliff after that.


In the last 4 games of the series (0-4), Giannis shot 47% from the freethrow line (17/36), and had 12 (he also fouled out this game, in a close loss that would have put them up 3-0), 25, 24, 21 scoring games on inefficient scoring from the field. His defense and rebounding were still on par, but his flaws as a player allowed the Raptors to take advantage of that and win the series, yet nobody bats an eye and are quick to brush it off as ""inexperience"" or ""THE KLAW"". No, Giannis straight up underperformed.",0.54,controversial,2020-07-17 06:12:16
