7,"[OC] Other ""Coach of the Year"" ballots may have more legitimacy or accuracy, but this is the only one that ranks the candidates from # 1 all the way to # 30",144,hxn56q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxn56q/oc_other_coach_of_the_year_ballots_may_have_more/,85,1595714279.0,"The NBA league office announced that all awards will be officially based on play PRIOR to the bubble. With that, the cases are locked, the campaigns are closed, and the voting will begin.

Rather than give a traditional ""Coach of the Year"" ballot that ranks from 1-3, I thought it may be an interesting (and indulgent) exercise to go all the way from 1-30.

Some caveats:

--- We're ranking coaches based on their performance THIS SEASON only. Obviously, Billy Donovan isn't as good of a coach as Gregg Popovich. However, if you were only ranking their ""Coach of the Year"" candidacy for this particular season, Donovan has a better campaign argument.

--- Since I don't watch every game for every team, I'm going to have to resort to a bigger picture analysis. If you're a diehard fan of your team who watches every game, you'd have a lot better insight into a coach's game management and situational adjustments. Let us know how you feel about that -- is your coach underrated? Overrated?

--- Personally, I'm going to rank coaches that *started* the year (as opposed to interim replacements.) That’s important to mention off the bat, because it applies right away —

######**the complete [COACH OF THE YEAR](https://next-episode.net/coach/season-8) Ballot**

**(30) David Fizdale, N.Y. Knicks: 4-18 record**

David Fizdale became a head coach with so much fanfare and media approval that his fall from grace has been more dramatic than Icarus. This year, he got fired 22 games into his second season on the job. Amazingly, this isn't the first time that's happened to him. Back in Memphis, he also got fired 19 games into his second season on the job.

We don't know exactly what goes on behind the scenes, but it can't be good. Do you know how bad things must be going to get fired 20 games into a season? That's like being halfway through sex with someone and saying: *ya know, I think I need to leave...* Something seriously FUNKY must have going on in there. Raging herpes. Oozing puss. Rotten vagina.

I don't want to call David Fizdale the rotten vagina of coaches, but his tenure with the Knicks did smell pretty funky. The team (right or wrong) signed a bunch of veterans with the intention to strive for the 8th seed, but they flopped. Ultimately, the real goal was giving their young prospects an environment to grow, but that didn't happen either. Dennis Smith and Kevin Knox are somehow getting worse and worse. 

The Knicks did a full house cleaning, but it may be some time before the smell is out of the building.

---

**(29) John Beilein, Cleveland: 14-40 record**

If you think it's difficult to get fired 20 games into a season, imagine getting fired halfway through your first year on the job right after you've signed a lucrative FIVE-YEAR contract. 

With John Beilein, we know more clearly what went wrong. In hindsight, it was a mistake to think that the 67-year-old Beilein could make the transition to the NBA after a lifetime in college. He simply didn't mesh with the ""thugs/slugs"" in the NBA, causing the Cavs to pull the plug before a full-out mutiny.

Given this disaster, how can we rank Beilein higher than Fizdale? We're splitting hairs, but there are a few more positives. Beilein's Cavs had a better record than Fizdale's Knicks despite lower expectations (based on over/under.) Beilein also ""resigned,"" meaning the decision to part was at least somewhat mutual. He realized the error of his ways, and handed things over to an experienced assistant in J.B. Bickerstaff. As embarrassing and costly as the Beilein era may have been, it's hard to see much long-term damage for the franchise.

---

**(28) Scottie Brooks, Washington: 24-40 record**

With John Wall injured, the Washington Wizards would have a hard time competing for the playoffs. Still, Scottie Brooks didn't help matters. The team ranked dead last in defensive rating by a good margin, indicating some serious issues with the system and the effort level. Even Bradley Beal looked disengaged on that end, ranking as one of the worst defenders in the league.

More than anything, Brooks' crime is a slow adjustment to that problem. Despite their defensive issues, he continued to start league [LVP](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) Isaiah Thomas for 37 games. Brooks seems like a likable guy, but his slow trigger has defined and tarnished his coaching career so far.

---

**(27) Jim Boylen, Chicago: 22-43 record**

Even his defenders would say Jim Boylen is about as cuddly as a cactus and charming as an eel. His players' support for him ranges behind tepid indifference and downright annoyance. Still, sometimes it takes a Grinch to get young players locked in on defense. To his credit, Boylen did improve the Bulls on that end. Their defensive rating leapt up from 25th to 14th this season.

But at the end of the day, the overall results simply aren't here. Despite offensive-minded youngsters like Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen (marginalized this year), the Bulls ranked 27th in offensive rating. Largely as a result, they were on pace to win 27.7 games, well short of their 33.5 over/under. Being ""likable"" and being ""successful"" don't go hand in hand, but NBA coaches need to check 1 of those 2 boxes to survive. So far, Boylen has gone 0 for 2.

---

**(26) Lloyd Pierce, Atlanta: 20-47 record**

The Atlanta Hawks hired Lloyd Pierce on the basis of his defensive reputation, but we've seen little evidence of that on the court so far. In his first year on the job, the Hawks ranked 27th in defensive rating. After a full year of training and development in his system, they climbed all the way up to... 28th. Through it all, franchise player Trae Young looks completely lost, grading as a worse defender than our LVP Isaiah Thomas. 

There's not much evidence that Pierce is a BAD coach, but there's not much evidence that he's going to be able to cure what ails them either. He'll probably get another season or two on the job from the patient franchise, but he needs to make some improvements eventually. Young is an albatross on defense, sure, but one little guard shouldn't be enough to sink you like this. (For evidence, consider Boston ranked 4th in defense during lil' Isaiah Thomas' near-MVP season.)

---

**(25) Kenny Atkinson, Brooklyn: 28-34 record**

Our third coach who got fired midseason actually ranks higher than others. On the court, it's hard to find much fault in Kenny Atkinson's performance. Despite having two max players on the shelf, he still had his Nets in the playoff race. They weren't any great shakes, but they were competitive.

However, we have to acknowledge that the job of an NBA coach goes beyond offensive and defensive ratings. It's also about managing a locker room, and managing egos. The Nets had built a good culture before this, but that culture presumably got rocked by the arrival of their new stars. It's up to Atkinson to bridge that gap, and instead it swallowed him whole.

---

**(24) Ryan Saunders, Minnesota: 19-45 record**

The Minnesota Timberwolves will fall well short of their preseason expectations (35.5 over/under), and will continue to waste Karl-Anthony Towns' historically good offensive talent. It's still unclear if young pup Ryan Saunders should have been handed this job at such a young age; he hasn't proven that he deserves it yet.

If there's any consolation, it's that Saunders appears in lock step with executive Gersson Rosas in terms of preferred playing style. Rosas came over from Houston with a desire to create more of a Morey-Ball approach. Saunders is doing his part, cranking up the gas to keep the team 3rd in pace, 3rd in three-point attempts, 3rd in free-throw attempts. The results don't match up yet, but at least they're on the same page. For now. Time will tell whether a new ownership group will come in and rip up that playbook.

---

**(23) Gregg Popovich, San Antonio: 27-36 record**

I imagine this low ranking will be among the least popular picks on the board. After all, Gregg Popovich is a legend. Even at this age, he's *still* a top 10 coach overall.

That said, legends aren't bullet proof or immune from criticism. Popovich needs to take some blame for an underwhelming year in San Antonio. The unconventional mid-range offense actually works better than you'd expect (11th in rating), but the problems come on the other end. The Spurs have struggled mightily on D this year, ranking all the way down at 25th. The rotations have been an issue there, with too much Bryn Forbes and Marco Bellinelli and probably too little Jakob Poeltl.

It still may feel weird to rank Pop in the bottom half for his performance this year, but I'd ask you: if this team was coached by a random dude named ""Joe Schmo,"" where would you put him?

---

**(22) Brett Brown, Philadelphia: 39-26 record**

This hasn't been a banner year for Gregg Popovich, and it hasn't been a banner year for his protege Brett Brown either. The Sixers made some head-scratching decisions this offseason. They grabbed the biggest pieces they could find, and jammed them together without much regard for ""fit."" Still, there's a lot of talent here. There's enough talent to justify their 54.5 preseason over/under, and there's enough talent to compete with everyone in the East (outside of Milwaukee, perhaps.)

Instead, the Sixers stumbled along on a 49-win pace, on track for the 6th seed. If this was a normal year without the COVID-bubble, then that would be a much bigger problem. The team is starting to make some adjustments and add more shooters like Shake Milton into the lineup, but it may be too little, too late.

---

**(21) Dwane Casey, Detroit: 20-46 record**

It's hard to judge veteran Dwane Casey either way based on the returns this season so far. The Pistons will fall well short of preseason expectations (37.5 over/under), but there are obvious reasons why. Star Blake Griffin got injured again, and pseudo-star Andre Drummond got traded away. 

To Dwane Casey's credit, he's tried to make a meal with the leftovers in the cupboard. Derrick Rose continues to be a fan favorite (if not an analytical darling), and PF Christian Wood appears to be a breakout success. Overall, there's no real identity or grand plan in place here, but perhaps that will change if the lottery balls go their way.

---

**(20) Terry Stotts, Portland: 29-37 record**

Terry Stotts and Dwane Casey may have a few beers after the season and commiserate together about their challenges this year. Like Casey, Stotts has been overwhelmed by injuries -- to Jusuf Nurkic -- to Zach Collins -- to Rodney Hood -- to Trevor Ariza -- etc. All this from a team that didn't have much depth to start.

Stotts and the Blazers drew a stroke of good luck with this bubble format. They'll be in the 9th spot right now, and well within range to sneak into the playoffs. If it wasn't for that, Stotts may be drawing more fire. The team's defense has slipped to 27th overall, which is hard to excuse no matter what roster problems you have. Stotts is a good and respected coach in general, but there's a chance his message may have run stale here. If they bomb out in the bubble, I wouldn't be surprised if they look for a fresh voice like assistant Nate Tibbetts for next year.

---

**(19) Luke Walton, Sacramento: 28-36 record**

Luke Walton and the Kings got off to a disastrous start given their expectations. It's never a good sign when your fanbase grumbles, *he's no Dave Joerger.* 

But after weathering the storm, there are some signs of hope on the horizon. A bold decision to bring Buddy Hield off the bench has worked out, with the team rattling off a 13-7 stretch before the shutdown. They had a slim chance to rally and make the playoffs if we played a full schedule, and they'll have some chance to do the same in the bubble. Overall, a disappointing start for Walton, but not a complete disaster.

---

**(18) James Borrego, Charlotte: 23-42 record**

It's very difficult to judge James Borrego, because it's difficult to judge exactly what was going on in the twisted minds of the Charlotte front office. On paper, Borrego did an admirable job to take a bad roster and lead them to a decent mark of 23 wins. In fact, their over/under coming into this year was only 23.5 over a full 82 games (lowest in the NBA). P.J. Washington's had a nice rookie year, and PG Devonte' Graham has been better than expected (although he's cooled off.)

At the same time, is *this* what the Hornets wanted? A ""not THAT bad"" team? As a result, they'll end up in the 8th slot prior to the NBA Draft lottery, in that dreaded middle ground. In a sense, Borrego did *too* good of a job squeezing out a few extra wins. I'm inclined to give him props for that because the franchise must have given him a mandate to compete (why else sign Terry Rozier to a big contract?). As a franchise, the team gets poor grades, but as a coach, it's hard to fault him here.

---

**(17) Alvin Gentry, New Orleans: 28-36 record**

James Borrego hasn't had much talent to work with in Charlotte. Down in Nawlins, Alvin Gentry may have *too much*. Earlier in the season, he appeared overwhelmed by all the pieces on the roster and struggled to develop a consistent rotation for the team. If it wasn't for Brandon Ingram's breakout, the Pelicans could have been in too deep of a whole to dig their way out.

Of course, some stocky rookie waddled in, and looked pretty darn good. Zion Williamson gives this team an entirely new ceiling, and has been worked into the lineup in a smart, prudent fashion. For that, Gentry deserves credit. He also deserves credit for having a consistent philosophy. His team is going to run, run, run like Forrest Gump. They've finished in the top 3 in pace each season for the past three years. It hasn't worked like a charm overall, as Gentry will be on track to finish with a losing record for the 4th time in his 5 years, but perhaps they'll finally hit their stride in the bubble.

---

**(16) Steve Clifford, Orlando: 30-35 record**

By this point, what you see is what you get with coach Steve Clifford. We've come to expect a top 10 defense (# 9 this year), but a record around the .500 mark. In his defense, the offensive talent is limited, and Jon Isaac (arguably their best overall player) missed significant time. Still, for Clifford to jump in these yearly rankings, we need to see more of an offensive system in place.

---

**(15) Steve Kerr, Golden State: 15-50 record**

WTF? Why is the coach with the worst record in the league doing all the way up here?

Allow me to explain. Being a head coach is like being a jockey. You need to know when to trot, when to stay with the pack, and when to crack the whip and turn up the gas down the stretch. And, sadly, you need to know when your horse is lame and needs to be shot and put out of its misery.

Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors realized they had a wobbly, broken-down horse early on, and put the breaks on sooner than later. As a result, they'll be locked into the # 1 spot among their NBA lottery odds. In theory that doesn't matter much because the top three teams (GS, CLE, MIN) all have the same odds at # 1 overall. However, if they slide down, Golden State will remain ahead of the others; the *worst* pick they can get is # 5. That type of patience is rare and admirable for a veteran coach like Kerr; after years of being in ""win now"" mode, he's showing a long-term vision as well.

---

**(14) Nate McMillan, Indiana: 39-26 record**

The Indiana Pacers continued to chug along with another playoff appearance despite Victor Oladipo missing more time. Coach Nate McMillan (and assistant Dan Burke) deserve a lot of credit for their strength defensively; they finished in the top 10 in defense for the second season in a row. Their scheme works well, and covers for some limited players along the way.

If there's any criticism of McMillan, it'd be on the offensive end. The Pacers found a little something with Domatas Sabonis as a playmaker (5.0 assists per game), but it's still not enough to make the team formidable offensively. Their ""MoreyBall"" rating is the worst in the league -- they finished last in both free-throw attempts and three-point attempts. Some teams can overcome that playing style, but the Pacers haven't been one of them; their offensive rating is # 18 for the second straight year. Given that need, I'd be curious to see if the team could develop Doug McDermott into a Bojan Bogdanovic - type player for them -- he hit 44.5% of his threes, but got only 20.0 minutes a game.

---

**(13) Monty Williams, Phoenix: 26-39 record**

This ranking may seem too high for the coach of a 26-39 team, but we need to consider some context here. The Phoenix Suns had finished with an average record of 20-62 over the last two seasons, so this 33-win pace is a marked step up for them. They've also gotten into the top 20 in offensive and defensive rating. That may sound like mediocrity to you, but again it's a big jump up from the previous year (28th offensive, 29th defense.)

Better still, we're seeing some strong player development from this club. Deandre Ayton still looked strong post PED suspension, and Mikal Bridges played well in the second half of the year. After all the mess and goat stink in Phoenix, there are actual good vibes here, and Monty Williams deserves credit for that.

---

**(12) Quin Snyder, Utah: 41-23 record**

Quin Snyder is an awesome coach, only penalized here by his own lofty expectations. Coming into the season, a few pundits though the Jazz may have what it took to be the top seed in the West, but they're going to fall short of that and even fall short of their preseason over/under (of 53.5 wins). Of course, it didn't help that Mike Conley forgot how to shoot for the few month or two of the season. Still, Snyder's bunch continues to be well coached on both ends, with ball movement on offense and discipline on defense. They'd have been an interesting playoff darkhorse if not for the bad corona-vibes and the unfortunate Bojan Bogdanovic injury.

---

**(11) Mike Malone, Denver: 43-22 record**

Denver's Mike Malone is in the same boat as Quin Snyder; he did a good job, but he's *expected* to do a good job. I'm going to rank him slightly higher because the Nuggets were slightly ahead, and were also set to slightly exceed their preseason win total (on track to win 54, 1 game better than their 53.0 estimate.)

Going forward, it'll be interesting to see if Malone can take his offense up a notch. They play at a very slow pace (29th) and don't shoot many threes (26th). To actually win the title, their shooters will need to step it up. If Gary Harris won't break out of his prolonged slump, then it's imperative that Michael Porter Jr. fulfills his potential and provides that third scoring punch.

---

**(10) Doc Rivers, L.A. Clippers: 44-20 record**

Stars and shooting aren't a problem for the Los Angeles Clippers. It's fair to say they're the most talented roster in the entire NBA. Given that, is their 44-20 record a disappointment? Eh. Maybe. But I'd counter that it doesn't really matter. Doc Rivers' primary mission this regular season was to make it to the playoffs healthy, and the team appears on track to do just that.

If there's any criticism here (of a team with a top 5 offense and defense) it's that their best players may not have gotten enough reps together. Do the new kids on the block Kawhi Leonard and Paul George fit with the old guard in Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell? What's the best starting lineup? Best *closing* lineup? There are still some unanswered questions here that need to be addressed in a hurry if they're going to fulfill their title aspirations in the bubble.

---

**(9) Taylor Jenkins, Memphis: 32-33 record**

Personally, I expected the Memphis Grizzlies to have the worst in the Western Conference, so it's downright shocking that they're in the 8th spot at the moment. The NBA may be trying to steal that playoff berth away from them, but that won't change the great job that rookie coach Taylor Jenkins has done this year.

Are the Grizzlies actually this good? Probably not. Their advanced stats are worse than their record, and Jaren Jackson Jr. hasn't taken the expected leap on defense yet. Still, wins are wins, and a coach shouldn't be penalized for collecting more than he should.

---

**(8) Mike D'Antoni, Houston: 40-24 record**

Based on the simple matter of wins versus preseason expectations (and an over/under of 54.0), the Houston Rockets have been slightly underwhelming this year. Still, veteran Mike D'Antoni deserves a lot of credit for remaking the team on the fly. Changing from Chris Paul to Russell Westbrook may not be a huge difference in quality, but it's a huge difference in playing style. As a result, the Rockets leapt up from the 26th fastest pace last year all the way up to 4th this season. They'll looking like a proper D'Antoni and Morey team right now.

In fact, they've taken that bold experiment up another notch this year by ditching Clint Capela and emulating [Rick Moranis](https://images.app.goo.gl/ooNpDDaJPEGFzzDM7). So far, so good. These Smallball Rockets still have some  lingering question marks about their defense and their rebounding, but they're extremely dangerous right now nonetheless. It's hard to imagine too many older coaches understanding and embracing this like D'Antoni has.

---

**(7) Brad Stevens, Boston: 43-21 record**

Brad Stevens has always been a media darling, and he's justifying that reputation this year. The Celtics lost Kyrie Irving and Al Horford, but are still top 5 in offense and top 5 in defense. Life without Kyrie has gone swimmingly, opening up some air for young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to breathe; they're both in the running for Most Improved Player. 

As with Mike D'Antoni, Stevens also deserves credit for working with a limited hand at center. But rather than force the issue and overplay some stiffs, he's understood that the team just may be better off with 6'8"" Daniel Theis manning the fort instead.

**(6) Frank Vogel, L.A. Lakers: 49-14 record**

It's never a good sign when you sign a new contract with a team, and are immediately placed among the favorites for ""First Coach Fired"" in Vegas. Frank Vogel walked that tightrope this season, with plenty of spectators expecting him to fail and fall to his demise.

Instead, Vogel has kept his head down, and kept his focus, and helped this Lakers team grab the # 1 seed out West. Obviously it's an easier task when you have LeBron James and Anthony Davis, but this isn't a loaded roster otherwise. Moreover, there are a lot of moving parts and new pieces to work in. The fact that Vogel has this largely-old team ranked # 3 in defensive rating is a true testament to his success this year.

---

**(5) Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee: 53-12 record**

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is on track to win his second consecutive MVP award. While we tend to think the media likes new ""narratives,"" but we've seen repeat winners before. Since 2000, Tim Duncan repeated as MVP, Steve Nash repeated as MVP, LeBron James repeated as MVP (on two separate occasions), and Steph Curry repeated as MVP as well.

*Coaches* don't get the same luxury. In fact, since the award was created in 1962, the Coach of the Year winner has NEVER repeated the following season. You win once, you get to the back of the line. That tendency has really hurt Mike Budenholzer's candidacy this year. On paper, he should absolutely be in the running. The Bucks are once again # 1 in defense, # 1 in overall rating, # 1 in W-L record. They're on a better pace than last year's team, despite losing Malcolm Brogdon over the summer. If Giannis can repeat for the same feat twice, why shouldn't Budenholzer be allowed to do the same?

---

**(4) Rick Carlisle, Dallas: 40-27 record**

Everyone expected the Milwaukee Bucks to be dominant, but no one expected the Dallas Mavericks to be this good, this early. They've jumped the line and arrived in the playoffs earlier than schedule. They're only 1 win away from beating their preseason over/under of 40.5 despite all the missed games.

Like Mike Budenholzer, Rick Carlisle has benefited in that endeavor from a transcendent player in Luka Doncic. At the same time, this Mavs' machine has been rolling with and without Doncic. They rank # 1 in offensive efficiency this year, and depending on whether you want to factor in pace and league trends or not, they may have one of the best offenses we've ever seen from a statistical standpoint. It's quite an achievement from a coach who cut his stripes as a defensive specialist, and indicates the type of attitude that coaches need to adapt and evolve over time.

---

**(3) Erik Spoelstra, Miami: 41-24 record**

The Miami Heat pulled a free agency coup by signing Jimmy Butler away from Philadelphia. Still, it's not like people expected that to vault them to the top of the East. Butler was a good player, but a difficult one to manage. He blended into the crowd as well as a skinhead at a Bar Mitzvah. Overall, adding Butler only boosted the team's preseason over/under win total to a modest 43.5.

Turns out, Butler fit in better with the Heat than anyone expected, on and off the court. Butler hasn't shot well from the field, but his attacking and playmaking helped open up the offense (6th in the league) and propelled the team to a 51.7-win pace. He's fit in like a glove in terms of their tough-dude culture as well.

Erik Spoelstra should get huge props for developing that culture and that system. But more than anything, he deserves credit for their player development system. Sure, Jimmy Butler is a star, and Bam Adebayo had star talent. At the same time, no one had ever heard of players like Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson at this time last year. These are complete randos who will make a combined $3M this season -- just half of Cristiano Felicio's salary. Having a coach who can grow talent like that in his backyard is a huge advantage for any franchise.

---

**(2) Billy Donovan, Oklahoma City: 41-24 record**

After Oklahoma City blew it up this summer by trading Russell Westbrook and Paul George, coach Billy Donovan felt like a dead man walking. Instead, Donovan and those fireproof zombie hordes in OKC sieged to a 41-24 record. How good is that? Hell, it's an even better winning percentage than the team had *last* year with Westbrook and George (in a career year.) 

Given all this surprising success, Donovan would be a fair winner of this award. He's managed to take in a bunch of new bodies and form a cohesive team. He's even had success playing three point guards together (CP3, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Dennis Schroder.) 

If you want to nitpick his candidacy, you could point out that the hodgepodge roster has a lot of talent scattered throughout. Chris Paul had become underrated, and Danilo Gallinari has always been underrated as well. The team's low preseason over/under total (32.5) was largely based on the uncertainty about further trades. Everyone knew that this team had the talent to be competitive if they stayed together. Still, no one expected them to be *this* good.

---

**(1) Nick Nurse, Toronto: 46-18 record**

Last season, Nick Nurse finally got his first chance as an NBA head coach. He ended up having as good of a rookie year as anyone since [Henry Rowengartner](https://images.app.goo.gl/qJFjmHV7PFkKAmsC9). Nurse coached circles around some of the best in the business en route to a championship season. 

Amazingly, he may have been even more impressive *this* year. Without Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, the Toronto Raptors held steady and didn't miss much of a beat. In fact, they're on pace to win 58.9 games, over a dozen more than their preseason over/under of 46.5. 

Technically, Nurse still has limited experience as an NBA head coach, but he's already proven to be one of the masters. If we were to judge based on the results of this (semi-)season only, he'd be my personal ""Coach of the Year.""",0.78,hot,2020-07-25 14:57:59

He’s putting up an MVP campaign in 6th man minutes.

Giannis has also played the same MPG as Joe Harris, and 1.6 MPG less than Marcus Smart, another very notable 6th man. 

Granted, all of these players basically play starter minutes, but their minutes are de facto restricted on their team because the starter at their position is more well-rounded and hence deserves more minutes (except for Lou’s case) except in certain circumstances. Giannis has no such restriction. Him playing more than he does is literally unsportsmanlike with the way he dominates. 

He’s even played less minutes than “Mr. Load Management” Kawhi Leonard, despite Kawhi having a far better supporting cast to ease his minutes. 

He is 63rd in the league in minutes, putting up top 5 rebounding and points per game, and is top-2 on his team in **every statistical category** except 3-pt shooting. Not to mention top-2 DPOY candidate. 

It’s just wild that his play style is basically auto-load-managing. He could play more if he wanted to. He doesn’t have to. They still have the best record in the league and he’s the runaway MVP. 

I just don’t see anyone can make a case against this man for not just MVP but a historic season. He just can’t stop getting better. 

Tangentially speaking of trajectories, Pascal Siakam is basically gonna be this man with slightly less dominance but a way better jump shot in just 1-2 more years. It’s a good time to be an NBA fan.

10,[OC] Why Kyle Kuzma sucks,21,hxvbdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxvbdp/oc_why_kyle_kuzma_sucks/,27,1595743974.0,"OFFICIAL r/FuckKyleKuzma Bible.

1. Kuzma shoots **29%** from three (6% below league average) and **43%** (3% below league average).  While already incredibly inefficient, these numbers become worse when you realize that Kuzma often shares the floor with a superstar such as LeBron James or Anthony Davis or both.  These superstars, while not only possessing otherworldly court vision, the defense often collapses and contorts to contain them.  These numbers elude to the fact that while Kuzma's looks may be rather uncontested or low in difficulty, **Kuzma either lacks the basketball IQ to select high percentage shots, or just lacks scoring talent.  Considering how Kuzma is a strictly offensive minded forward, these numbers are concerning for Lakers fans to say the least.**

2. While Kyle Kuzma's usage rate has been steady at around **21%-23%** compared to his previous two seasons, Kuzma averages **5.2** less points than last year.  **Stable usage and decreased scoring over multiple seasons means a drastic drop in efficiency.**

3. Kuzma's assist to turnover ratio, AST/TO is **.8**, and the lowest of the Laker's guards and forwards by a considerable margin.  This means he is more likely to turn the ball over than he is to set another player up for a score.  For reference, **Kentavious Caldwell Pope, a player who earns similar minutes and plays on the wings with Kuzma  AST/TO is 2.6, 1.8** ***higher.***

4. Kuzma's net rating is **5.3**.  Net rating can be defined as a metric to measure how much better or worse a team becomes when a player is on the floor.  While Kuzma has a positive net rating, the Laker's average net rating is **7.4**.  **The Lakers, a contending team with nearly 50 wins becomes inherently worse when Kuzma is on the floor.**  Kuzma's net rating is no doubt where it is because of the talent around him, and not himself.

5. While Kuzma is an offensive minded forward, his defense has somehow regressed from previous seasons.  Kuzma's struggles on the defensive end have been well documented by Laker fans, as he lacks the foot speed and defensive IQ to guard the more talented small forwards, but also lacks the strength and low post presence to contain power forwards.  This is proven by Kyle's **Defensive Box Plus/Minus** which calculates a players efficiency at stopping an opposing player from scoring, adjusting to a league average team.  Kuzma's is **-1.3, proving him to be a defensive liability.**  Kuzma does not lack the frame nor wingspan to be an effective defender, seemingly just the effort.

6. This the one that pisses me off the most.  While I dont have any fancy metrics or advanced stats to prove, Kuz seems more concerned with being an Instagram model than an NBA player.  Kuzma did a Vanity Fair photo shoot February 11th, one day before the Lakers pivotal February 12th matchup with the at the time 2nd place Denver Nuggets before the All Star Break.  Kuzma dropped 3 points, and had a plus minus of **-11.**  Furthermore, Coach Frank Vogel wisely decided against playing Kuzma in crunch time, instead opting those minutes to former two-way guard Alex Caruso.  **I'm sure there are many more instances of Kuz pulling shit like this, but I don't have the patience nor will power to scroll through his social medias and cross reference his shitty performances.**


I'm sure there is a mountain of evidence and statistics to prove that the Lakers should've dumped Kuz during the deadline when they had the chance, but I regress.  I feel I have encapsulated Kuz's offensive and defensive incompetency, as well as his reluctance to contribute to a contending NBA basketball team.  To simplify and summarize the article, Kuz has regressed majorly on offense, is a defensive liability, and makes the Lakers worse when he steps onto the floor.

I'm not considering players who have taken too few shots and/or don't have a large enough sample size to judge from. Moreover, I wanted to look at players who are going to play a major role in the bubble.

# Luka Doncic

*97 min, 65 FGA, 32/17/65, 41.9% TS*

Mavericks have the best offense this season but their **clutch offense ranks 29th**(!) in the league. The Mavs are 14-21 in close games, which is 22nd (W-L) in the league and they're the only playoff team in the bottom 10. Luka has a 36.2 USG% in clutch and almost every possession starts from him but unlike last year he hasn't been good enough in crunchtime. He also has the **lowest TS%** out of 29 players with more than 50 FGA.

Clutch FGs by distance from rim:

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|4-12 (33%)|6-35 (17%)|

* Luka's shot 6-35 from distance and most of his attempts from beyond the arc are closely contested step back threes at the end of the shot clock. Shots like these - over [Okogie](https://imgur.com/lk7Y1WW) or [Schroder](https://imgur.com/ydBcCWz) aren't considered good shots for most players but Luka has hit stepbacks at a decent clip (34.7%) this season. This might be the result of poor shot selection ([?](https://imgur.com/Ug20RU3))
* Luka is also 1-13 on [shots to tie or take the lead](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_id=2020&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=N&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=2&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&is_tying=Y&is_go_ahead=Y&c1stat=fga&c1comp=ge&c1val=10&order_by=fga#stats::7) in the final 2 mins
* He is 8th in total clutch assists (21) and 6th in assists *per 100 possessions.* His assists usually come off blow-bys and [kicking-out](https://imgur.com/2cxbo5d) for a 3 or to a [cutter](https://imgur.com/XIMmnyY). He's also prone to turning the ball over but that's to be expected with being the primary option and being blitzed constantly

Ultimately, Luka (and the Mavs) need to be better on offense in close games (which are inevitable in the playoffs) because they're not beating anybody with their defense.

# LeBron James

*97 min, 60 FGA, 33/17/62, 43.3% TS*

LeBron numbers show that he hasn't really been klutch this season. He has the second lowest TS% out of players who've attempted atleast 50 FGs.

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|2-11 (18%)|5-29 (17%)|

* Out of his 60 field goal attempts, nearly half of them (5-29) are three pointers and almost all of his 3s are the signature 'stare at the ball' stepback three. Contrary to the memes, he's far from automatic on these shots in the clutch. Even when's able to get the switch he desires he frequently settles for [26+ ft shots](https://imgur.com/NnucbCo).
* LeBron also posts up a good number of times when he gets a smaller defender on him. He easily bullies his way down and turns around for a [fadeaway jumper](https://imgur.com/XcidVgd) which hasn't been accurate (unless it's [boston](https://imgur.com/dXDBh0U) ofc) or [spins](https://imgur.com/Z2GY3SE) and finishes at the rim. After watching all of his clutch shots and looking at the numbers, it's evident that he hasn't really been efficient anywhere outside the restricted area.
* Looking on the bright side, LeBron's second in total assists(26) and **first in assists** ***per 100 possessions***. His vision and passing is nearly lethal - most of his assists are from [rolling](https://imgur.com/NlMnQTH)/[cutting](https://imgur.com/UTMV0FA) big men; and when double teamed on the [post](https://imgur.com/Joq0atx) or the [perimeter](https://imgur.com/xKJinmb), he delivers pinpoint passes to open teammates.

In the end, I'm not too concerned because... uh because it's LeBron. The Lakers have the 4th best clutch record (18-9) despite LeBron's shooting struggles and it would be foolish to not expect LeBron to be a notch better in the playoffs.

# Jimmy Butler

*100 min, 60 FGA, 28/15/74, 45.6% TS*

Butler had great clutch stats last season but it's been a totally different story this season. He has the **lowest FG%** out of  29 players who've attempted 50 field goals and by a wide margin of 4% from second lowest (Luka). He's usually the primary ball handler on the Heat and has to create his own shots.

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|0 to 4FT|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|7-14 (50%)|7-26 (27%)|3-20 (15%)|

* He has taken a good number of pull-up jumpers from both [beyond the arc](https://imgur.com/JVpiIdG) and in the [mid-range](https://imgur.com/649tyHQ) with underwhelming efficiency. Outside the paint, he struggles to make a field goal and he's only able to finish at the rim [against bad defenses](https://imgur.com/5KWoJZV); clutch rim finishing (50%) is significantly worse than season percentage (63.7%)).
* Butler is 2-19 on [shots to tie or take the lead](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_id=2020&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=N&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=2&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&is_tying=Y&is_go_ahead=Y&c1stat=fga&c1comp=ge&c1val=10&order_by=fga#stats::7) in the final 2 mins
* Clutch FT numbers can sometimes be misleading because of intentional fouls. That's partly true for Butler too but even after considering those, he draws a ton of [fouls](https://imgur.com/u3ejqH1) (much like the whole season). He's first in total FTA and FTA per 100 in the clutch. His TS% isn't decent  despite being buoyed by FTs.
* Aside from his shooting woes, Butler has been quite impressive as a playmaker. He rarely turns the ball over and makes the right passes when defenses collapse on the paint. [Robinson](https://imgur.com/IPO0VKt) (*8-21 from 3*) and [Herro](https://imgur.com/qX6PrQC) (*8-15 from 3*) have been reliable at the receiving end of these passes.

# Brandon Ingram

*106 min, 63 FGA, 36/28.6/70, 47.3% TS*

Pelicans are in the bottom 5 in both clutch offense and defense and are 12-24 in close games. To be fair they didn't have their full line-up for majority of the season. Before Zion joined, Ingram was the first option on the team and was taking almost every shot in crunchtime. 

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|9-29 (31%)|6-21 (28.6%)|

* Ingram's midranges are usually [turnaround fadeaways](https://imgur.com/r2mLnQ1) where he uses his length to shoot over defenders. His efficiency on those is below average. Sometimes, he pulls up in the mid-range while [coming off a screen](https://imgur.com/COh54g2) too. He's [finished](https://imgur.com/ZEwcOoK) at rim with his season efficiency.
* Pretty much all of his three pointers are [off the catch](https://imgur.com/wUkInQG) or [1 dribble pull-ups](https://imgur.com/4b7EJcT) off a screen,and he's shooting below 30% on them
* He doesn't pass too often, but has shown that he can find the [cutting man](https://imgur.com/IOmlCLR) or an [open shooter](https://imgur.com/Iu9WXcl) from the post. He was constantly blitzed against Utah and was able to [find Favors](https://imgur.com/43SCZbV) on multiple possessions without turning the ball over.",0.84,hot,2020-07-25 15:29:31

I would personally say Dejounte Murray, he is an animal on defense ( also best defender against harden statistically), he is also pretty solid on offense as well. 

     Although this may be bias because I am from the Seattle area. My next pick would have to be Devonte Graham.

I remember a while back when there was a broadcaster strike in Canada, all NHL games were shown without commentary and the audio was focused on the players’ talking, the sound of the skates on the ice, and the coaches calling plays. It gave a more intimate feel to the broadcast and was a pretty decent simulation of being in the arena.",0.9,hot,2020-07-25 14:59:07

24,Kawhi or Healthy Curry right now,9,hxqdtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxqdtd/kawhi_or_healthy_curry_right_now/,103,1595726385.0,"Curry being injured basically all year but we all know what he’s capable of. Some people have Curry as high as No.2 in the league while for others he’s as low as No.6.

Kawhi is regarded by some to be the No.1 guy in the whole league and is usually at least Top 5 in everyone’s lists.

Personally, if I took 2019 Curry, I’d put him over Kawhi right now. Could be an unpopular opinion. We all know Kawhi’s defense is miles better. However offense is more important than defense and Curry is an All Time All Time great on offense. 

I’d say Healthy Curry is No.3 right now and Kawhi is No.4. Counting KD by the way.

So far I hope he is the leading candidate of 6th man of the year. He has a good scoring ability even though the Thunder plays 3 point guards minus the fact the SGA plays the shooting guard position. I also think the Thunder roster is extremely underrated with Chris Paul,SGA,Schroder,and Steven Adams. Personally I think this core can make a deep playoff run.",0.73,hot,2020-07-25 17:54:10
26,[Marchand] ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski opens up about email that got him suspended,209,hxbt3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxbt3d/marchand_espns_adrian_wojnarowski_opens_up_about/,72,1595660005.0,"Woj spoke to Andrew Marchand. He’s now free:

> The question that caused Wojnarowski to halt was if he had ever sent a “F–k you” email to anyone before he delivered that message to Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo) two weeks ago.

> “I regretted sending that email,” Wojnarowski told The Post after the long pause. “I have not made a habit of doing that, but I sent that one and I regret it.”

> Wojnarowski later said he had never sent an email such as that before, but he is fully regretful for his actions that led to what he thinks is the first suspension of his life, a two-week timeout without pay that has just concluded.

In regards to ESPN, he understands why he was suspended:

> “I took away focus from the company,” Wojnarowski said. “In that way, I think I let people down. It is a difficult enough time that we are living in, that the company is operating in, that everybody is having to deal with. I made it harder for everybody. That was difficult to come to grips with.”


Good to have WOJ back!

Bird of course won 3 times and finished 2nd 4 times. Durant, Harden, and Jordan all have 3 2nd place finishes. Here's a full list I believe with 1st place finishes in parenthesis:

4 - Bird (3), West (0), Lebron (4)

3- Jordan (5), Harden (1), Durant (1)

2- Gervin (0), Robinson (1), Shaq (1), KG (1), Mcadoo (1), Magic (3), Duncan (2), Petit (2), Wilt (4), Russell (5)

Lebron will also become #1 in mvp award shares after this season passing jordan, and will become 2nd in most top 5 finishes with 14 behind Kareems 15.

None have ever racked up even 10K assists and rebounds, let alone with 35K points, and Lebron could break all 3 of those marks this next season

LeBron is currently 913 points / 647 rebounds / 702 assists away from 35K / 10K / 10K

Therefore, assuming lebron plays 5 of his 8 regular season games in Disney (inevitable rest before the playoffs) and 70 of his 82 next season, he would need to average 12.2 points / 8.6 rebounds / 9.3 assists to break all 3 marks next season.

Definitely not easy, but unreal that he could be the first ever player to get to 10K+ assists and rebounds in NBA history

NOW BACK TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING:
_______
First, let's wet our whistles with a couple videos. We'll watch how Simmons shot the ball in-game and during shootaround at the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)  
And now compare that to how he shoots the ball in shootaround in this video taken during 'rona-times (peep the masks): [https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22)

**WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.**
______

During my 15 years of coaching ball, I've done a **lot** of *probably* way too in-depth studying of how to build the most efficient, simple, and fluid jumper. This eventually led me to develop the curriculum for, and coach, my own 4 day 'Shooting Camps' where a jumper is broken down to:

**Day 1** lower body  
**Day 2** upper body pre- and during-shot  
**Day 3** upper body during- and post-release of shot  
**Day 4** everything previously learned put into the overall package of a jumpshot

Okay okay okay. We're going to look at Simmons' jumper in a similar way to how these camps were structured, starting with the foundation and working our way up... We'll look at Simmons' jumper from the Nike Hoop Summit, which was at the end of his grade 12 season, and compare it to how he shoots meow.
______

**LOWER BODY**

* We see Simmons' lower body action pre-, during-, and post-shot in ""[Clip 1: ""BEN SIMMONS CAN SHOOT 3's - Evidence of Ben Simmons three point range""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)"", from the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016, as quite consistent and close to the ideal of what you would want.

* He gathers quickly and even though it is slight, he does do a 1-2 step into the catch, allowing him to load his legs up and have them read to quickly explode up to shoot. Simmons has the lengthwise centre-line of his feet under the outside of his hipbones and the outside of each foot under each shoulder, which, IMO, is the optimal stance to find the sweet-spot between balance (and we know without proper balance in your foundation, it's going to be *hellishly* tough to shoot when moving at full-speed with defenders flying at you) and explosiveness in your jumper. You can also see he is on the balls of his feet with bouncy knees, making for great elastic energy going from his legs to his upper body when shooting the ball. Finally, his lower body is all squared to his target with his feet just *slightly* angled to the right of his target as this best brings his shooting arm's elbow to point at the basket.  

* Compared to Simmons' lower body this month in [Clip 2: 7SIXERS STAR PLAYER BEN SIMMONS SHOWS HIS LONG RANGE SHOOTING IN A PRACTICE SESSION](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22) and during this season, but pre-'rona, in [Clip 3: Pull-Up Midrange Jumper In-Game](https://youtu.be/DkqGMNhSOWU?t=102), it is all quite similar.

Hmmm the lower body may not be the problem...

* *DO NOT FORGET*: The power for shooting the ball *should* come from you lower body and shooting on the way up (a la Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II), NOT from your upper body.

**UPPER BODY**

The upper body of Ben Simmons' jumper, to quote Clive Owen in ""Inside Man"": therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.

* Simmons had, as can be seen from the [2016 Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), the ball at a high shooting pocket, with his shooting thumb above his shooting eyebrow. This was great because he could see the hoop with both eyes when the ball was up into his shooting pocket. Also, since you are lining up your shooting foot, knee, hip, elbow (his is just slightly off from lining up with the rest, but it's really not a problem), and hand straight on with your target, everything simply has to extend up and out to go straight to your target. *And* having such a high shooting pocket coupled with great height and length makes his shot extremely difficult to block.

* *HOWEVER*, now, as evidenced [here](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22), Simmons has the ball moved over more in the centre of his head with his shooting thumb more above his opposite eyebrow. This means, as his lower body is still nicely lined up with his target and has not changed for the worse since 2016, he will be flicking more across from the centre of his head to finish his follow through lined up with his lead shooting foot. He's actually shooting across to get the ball to the hoop instead of just shooting it straight to the hoop... I believe because of this--as you can see--his shooting elbow is pointed out to his left a lot more in the recent shooting clips compared to the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit clips.  

* He *needs* to get that hand solidly lined up above his shooting eyebrow as it was [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg) and bring his elbow in. This would stop him from having this wacky fling from right to left when shooting. You'll notice most of Ben's misses are either right or left of the target... this is probably because of this right to left slingshot/catapult he is doing.

* Lastly, and another MAJOR KEY (this post has no affiliation with DJ Khaled and if any resemblance to Khaled is perceived it is completely accidental) is, when looking at [Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), Simmons shot it so fluidly because he shot on the way up! It was SO fluid looking and with great timing on his release he was properly transferring all the power from his lower body to the upper body of his shot.

* BUT, looking at it meow, you can see from the [2019-20 in-season clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkqGMNhSOWU) and the [bubble shootaround](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=8) it's like you've just held the 'shoot-button' in 2k a liiiiitle too long and your MyPlayer (who looks an awful lot like Ben Simmons) has held his release until he's on the way down. What this does is cause a shooter to lose all the power from their legs--and as we mentioned previously all the power for your shot *should* come from the largest muscles of your body: your legs. Simmons is effectively only getting power from his upper body, the left-to-right fling shot motion he has developed. Probably a reason you don't generally see Simmons miss long.

*Aspiring coaches and shooters, remember this:*

* The upper body technique is what smoothly guides the ball to the centre of the hoop, whereas *power* for getting the ball to the hoop comes from the lower body in conjunction with timing your shooting release point to get the maximum power from the lower body.  
*Especially* work on using the strength of the lower body during shooting, not after you've already shot: while on your way up is the optimal time to shoot the ball as the momentum/kinetic energy from your extending lower body will fully transfer to the ball. Think about loading a spring then letting it go! That bouncy/elastic energy is what you get from properly executed lower body shooting technique. If you combine that with good upper body technique and releasing your shot on the way up, you'll then be most-efficiently transferring the energy from your legs into getting the ball to the rim.

**OVERALL**

* When you put it all together, Simmons had a fluid, efficient, and comfortable looking shot form in [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg). It was all one motion, and he shot on the way up.

* But now, Simmons holds his shot until he is on the way down; he has lost any fluidity he had and is losing all the power from his lower body. He relies on the current right-to-left slingshot flick he's developed. I'd love to see him rebuild, or return, to that earlier form.  

__________

I don't understand what the fuck happened. Maybe it will always be a mystery. But Ben, if you ever read this, please get back to how you shot before. It was just so damn fluid and effective.

37,Why Seth Curry can be the best low usage scorer of all time,99,hxbfye,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxbfye/why_seth_curry_can_be_the_best_low_usage_scorer/,32,1595658627.0,"This may like a ridiculous statement, but the stats back it up. This is NOT an overreaction to his perfect shooting performance last night, but rather a long-standing belief about my favorite player in the league.

Many people think Seth Curry is just a shooter, but this is far from the truth. Seth is one of the most versatile offensive players in the league, allowing him to take advantage of the many varied opportunities next to Luka in the Mavs flow offense. let’s look at his case as an elite low-usage scorer:

**AT THE RIM**

Seth shoots **72% at the rim** (82 percentile), which is considered elite for a guard. He is great at abusing mismatches brought by the mavs offense and creating his own shots. He’s in the 90th percentile in efficiency scoring off drives and the 75th percentile scoring in PnR. He has a lot of skill controlling the big man on the inside, having the ability to freeze the big at the rim by feinting an attack, only to hit a short fade or hit him with a deadly floater. 


**IN THE MIDRANGE**

Seth is **1st in the league in midrange fg%** (minimum 50 attempts) at **57%** on above average volume. He has one of the most accurate middy floaters in the league, and he is deadly on long 2s, shooting **56% from 16ft-3p, good for 3rd in the league**. To put it simply, he’s the best low-usage midrange player in the NBA


**FROM 3**

I know I don’t have to tell anyone this, but Seth is an all-time great shooter. He is **2nd all-time in career 3p% 44.3%** and **2nd this season in 3p% at 45.3%**. He is always ready to pull the trigger, averaging **7.1 3p attempts per 36**, and his movement off ball, as well as the defense Luka draws, creates plenty of opportunity. 

After reading about his incredible efficiency on every part of the floor, it may not surprise you that, if he had enough minutes to qualify, Seth would be **11th all-time in career ts%, right behind Reggie Miller**



**IF HE’S SO GREAT, WHY HAS HE PLAYED BACKUP MINUETS HIS WHOLE CAREER?**

Unfortunately for Seth, he is the size of a PG while having the play-style of a SG. This makes it difficult for most teams to play him with a primary playmaker without sacrificing too much size (not an issue with the Mavs, considering their PG is 6’7 and guards forwards). Seth is not a bad defender, but he isn’t nearly good enough to make up for his positional awkwardness. This, combined with the fact that he was a late bloomer and didn’t get playing time until his late 20’s, means he’s just now getting his first real shot at being an important piece. 


**IN SUMMARY**

I believe if Seth was given the full-time starting role can score 18-20 a game on fairly low usage with near league-best efficiency (as he was after being reinstated into the starting rotation midway through the season), being third scoring in scoring on a championship level team.",0.91,hot,2020-07-24 23:30:27

Michael Jordan's championship seasons are all top 25 scoring seasons of all time (regular season + post season). There are different methodologies for ranking scoring seasons but regardless of what methodology is used all six of Jordan's championships seasons will be somewhere around the top only.

This is very special because when we think of great scorers like Kobe and Harden they had to sort of dial back their scoring in order to allow the team to function better as a whole. Jordan also sacrificed but not to the same extent -- he was still averaging 30+ ppg in both the regular season and post season, or close to it, in his championship seasons. There are possible reasons for this, such as the lack of zone defenses at the time. But even then, that is truly remarkable and pretty much sums up why Michael Jordan is the GOAT.",0.66,hot,2020-07-25 06:32:23

Has potential to be the best in the league some day but right now his shooting isn't good enough. Regardless, the threat of his stepback three opens up opportunities, and the kid is an absolutely lethal scorer on drives.

**4. Lebron James**

It's not really his game but he's still a threat in isolation. His jumper has become respectable over the years. And a Lebron James drive to the rim is one of the most unstoppable scoring moves. 

**3. Damian Lillard**

Well-rounded three level scorer who was kinda forced to iso a lot this season with how decimated his team was. One of the best shooters in the NBA. 

**2. Kawhi Leonard**

Another lethal three level scorer. At points, he kept the Raptors afloat last postseason by constantly taking iso midrange shots. Strong and smart enough to get to his spots. 

**1. James Harden**

The iso king. He'll either take a high percentage stepback three, or drive for a high percentage shot at the rim or a foul. Harden isos could be a team's entire offense.

He has an old man game that can slot into the 2000s quite seamlessly and he's shown his ability to step up when it matters and when the guy co-stars for isn't around, his only hiccup having been last year and even then it was because he spent a good deal of the Raptors series guarding someone who is arguably one of the best players in the NBA in Kawhi Leonard.

I'm not saying he'd be an insanely amazing addition for a team at that point in time, I'm just saying he'd be a great floor raiser on a good team in that era.",0.58,hot,2020-07-25 17:35:48

47,My NBA Awards for the 2019-20 season,25,hxekxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxekxo/my_nba_awards_for_the_201920_season/,40,1595670799.0,"So this is basically my award show, aka the players I think who won the award this year. And I know we still got 8 games left, and it could sway the voters a little bit, but for the most part, I feel like it is safe to say that we most likely know who the award is going to. So without further ado, let us get on with it. 

1. Sixth Man Of The Year- Dennis Schroder of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Now, this one maybe a little controversial, since a lot of you were expecting Lou Will or Montrezl Harrell to win this award, as they have put up great numbers coming off the bench. But I cannot deny the story behind OKC's success this season. Coming into the season, we did not expect OKC to be where they are, but with the help of their three-headed guard lineup of CP3. Shai, and Schroder, they have outplayed everyone's expectations. Coming off the bench, he is putting up 19.0 points on 46.8% from the field, and 38.1% from three on 5.1 attempts per game, which is the most threes he as attempted per game in his entire career, which shows that he has worked on his game in the off-season, as three point-shooting was a major problem in his career. Also, I assume voter fatigue will kick in for the voters, and after seeing the Cinderella story of OKC, and how much of a factor Schroder played in their success, I feel like he will most then likely get this award. 
2. Most Improved Player Of The Year- Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat. At this point, it should be in debates of whether or not Bam should win the award unanimously. I mean, let me put it this way; the guy went from starting 28 of his 82 games in the 2018-19 season, averaging a mere 8.9 points and 7.3 rebounds, to the center piece of the Miami Heat on both sides of the floor, averaging 16.8 points on 56.7% from the field, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks a game. This dude literally improved in every major statistical stat, and is now considered the prototype for the modern NBA Center. The man can do it all: he can handle the rock, be a great playmaker, a strong rim runner, and be a defensive monster either on the perimeter or in the paint (his world class strength and athleticism does help in this factor as well). The only thing he needs to add in his bag is a shot, and that is coming his way. But even without it, at the young age of 22, he is considered a top 5 center, a dark horse contender for Defensive Player of the year, and might get his first spots on the all-nba and all-defensive teams. 
3. And Speaking of Defensive Player Of The Year- Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. This was the hardest for me to vote on (yes, even harder than the MVP). I mean, you got 4 different candidates, who equally have the potential to win this award. You got the reigning DPOY winner in Rudy Gobert, who is having yet again another stellar season in anchoring the defense of the Jazz (which has kind of slipped from second to the eleventh place), averaging 13.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. We got Anthony Davis, who 9.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 2.4 blocks a game, while being the best defender on the floor for the Lakers, who have the third best defense in the league. You also got Ben Simmons, who leads the league in steals, at 2.2 steals a game, and his size gives him the ability to for real to guard positions from the 1 to the 5, as he is the most switchable and best guard defender in the league. But man, I got to keep it a buck with you (pun intended), Giannis is by far the best defender in the league. His mere 1.0 steal and 1.0 block a game may not be seen as valuable, but the man passes the eye test (and he does lead the league in most of the advanced defensive stats, when a player has played over 40 games). He has made this bucks defense one of the greatest of all time, and I cannot deny that, and so the award (according to me), rightfully goes to him.
4. Rookie Of The Year- Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies. This is almost as clear cut as the Most Improved Player Award, but with the bubble rules, this can change. You know what, nevermind, I'm still sticking with my guy Ja. The dude has been spectacular this season, and has put the Grizzlies on a good path for the future. No one expected him to take this team to the eight seed, and yet there they are. 17.6 points on 49.9% from the field, and 36.7% from three on 2.6 attempts per game, and 6.9 assists per game, which means he leads all rookies in total points and assists. Regardless of how good Zion has played since he came back to the pelicans in mid January, Ja has been ballin from the start, and I cannot deny the body of work, and how much the grizzlies have surpassed our expectations.
5. And speaking of surpassing our expectations, Coach Of The Year- Nick Nurse of the Toronto Raptors. Imagine this scenario. You are the NBA Champions, as you were lead there by the best player on your team. You expect him to return to your squad, but instead he hitches the wagon on the LA trail and heads west. You are then expected to be good, but not be contenders for trying to repeat as back-to-back champions. But then, you break all expectations and maybe in a good spot to repeat as NBA Champions. That is the Toronto Raptors this season, who are lead by an emerging star in Pascal Siakam, a good/underrated point guard in Kyle Lowry, and the defensive minded head coach in Nick Nurse. Despite losing the best two-way player in the game in Kawhi Leonard, the raptors have still managed to be a top 15 offensive team, and the second best defensive team in the league, and that is because of the good defensive scheme that is run by Coach Nurse, who for sure deserves this award. 
6. And finally, The Most Valuable Player- Lebron Ja..... Nah, I'm just playing. It has to go to the Greek Freak, aka Giannis Antetokounmpo  of the Milwaukee Bucks. Now, I know I have pissed off a lot of Lebron Stans, and they are waiting to call me a hater in the comments. But before you do so, I just want to make my points heard. Giannis is averaging 29.6 points on 54.7% from the field, and 30.6% from three on 4.8 attempts a game (which is an improvement from last year). He is also averaging 13.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists, and is the motor behind a bucks team that has a top 10 offense, and an historic defense as mentioned earlier. He is also doing this on 30.9 minutes per game, and without a co-star (not to diss Middleton. He is good. But for those of you Lebron Stans, would you rather have AD or Middleton as your co-star). He has also learned how to be a better leader, as he has improved on minute errors in his game, and is able to squeeze more wins out of his playstyle. Although Lebron has had a great comeback season, I am sorry, but I am going to have to give this one to Giannis.  

But there they are my awards. What do you guys think? Did I get them correct? Do comment down below your thoughts.",0.72,hot,2020-07-25 02:53:19

50,My top 3 most improved players of the 2019-20 NBA season,13,hxddxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxddxs/my_top_3_most_improved_players_of_the_201920_nba/,50,1595665990.0,"1. Brandon Ingram 


Ingram has taken his level to a complete different level this season. His major improvements have come from his 3pt shooting and his free throw shooting which has seen his TS% rise from 55% to 59% while increasing his PPG by 6 points. His also averaging career highs in PPG, RPG, APG and SPG. He also made his first all star team in a tough western conference.


2. Bam Adebayo 

Bam has gone from a promising young player last year to an all star this year. He is averaging career highs in all major statistics and also averaging a double double. Although his TS% has lowered by 2% he still has an above average TS% of 60%. Maybe his biggest improvement has been his playmaking and passing. He’s averaging 3 more assists and also registered 3 triple doubles. 


3. Luka Doncic 


Everyone knows about the steps Luka has taken this year. He’s been arguable a top 3 player this season which is a massive improvement. The only knock on his case is the fact 2nd year players rarely win the award.

Of course there are generational players like Zion, Lebron and Kobe who could compete as teenagers. But look at a player like Kevin Knox who hasnt fully developed, and thus his potential is largely unknown but the Knicks are now in a dilemma bc his rookie contract is almost up and they have to decide to whether to extend him based upon perceived potential. And I'm not picking on Knox as I'm sure every team has a Knox. But I'm wondering whether it's more prudent to draft an older, more mature college player.

3) The scorers that spam one or two really, really effective, unstoppable moves. These are the guys like Curry, Harden and Kareem. They aren't as versatile as number 1 or as athletic as number 2. But they have 1 or 2 moves that are so effective that it more than makes up for it.

When Richaun Holmes left the bubble to get a chicken wing food delivery, he likely made contact with 1-2 people before rejoining the bubble. While this was wrong of him, he got a 10 day quarantine which I think is excessive but not unwarranted.

Zion leaves the bubble for a family matter. While he likely came to the league to discuss this, he only got 4 days of quarantine even though he likely made contact with many more people

Lou Williams leaves the bubble for a family matter and then is CAUGHT going out to party and hang out with people outside the bubble, no quarantine or punishment announced. 

Is this a market issue? Or just something that the league didn’t think about? Pardon my skepticism, I’m a kings fan

70,Players capable of winning DPOY and MVP in the same year within the next few years,11,hx6xmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx6xmq/players_capable_of_winning_dpoy_and_mvp_in_the/,72,1595643330.0,"There have only been a handful of players to have won DPOY and MVP in the same year including Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan. Here are the current NBA players capable of winning both awards in the same year.

5. Joel Embiid

I wish I could put Joel higher, but availability has to count for something. Joel has missed almost 20 games every season (he was on pace to play more games this year to be fair). When it comes to an award like DPOY, we all know Embiid is capable of showing that he is one of the best defenders in the league, however, since bigs like AD and Gobert are still a slight notch above him defensively. In my opinion, Joel had an underrated season last year and was both a monster on the defensive and offensive end. His production on both ends has gotten lower this year, and obviously that can be attributed to fit, but since this Sixers team has locked this roster for the next few years I kept him here.  Assuming he doesn't get any major injuries, he has around 7 prime years to win both awards.

(I wouldn't argue if you swapped 5 and 4 as I think they are pretty close)

4. Paul George

I have Paul George so low, because he I feel like there is no way he could give an MVP and DPOY case while on the same team with Kawhi. Last year Paul George was in contention for both awards, but when it came to voting he wasn't even close to getting DPOY or MVP. PG has around 4 more prime years left: one those years will be on the Clippers, so its more like 3 years for him since I doubt he wins either award on the same team with him. If PG decides next year to go to a team where he is the main star I think it is possible for him to win DPOY in the future; however, I don't see him being able to significantly top the production he had in OKC last year and put himself above future competition like Giannis or Luka Doncic. (I know Paul George didn't play as many games this season, but has been pretty healthy for the last 4 years)

3. Kawhi Leonard

It feels odd to put Kawhi so high yet in a way so low. These are all regular season awards, and like Embiid, availability needs to count for something. Kawhi has played fewer games for the past three years. In his last real year in San Antonio he was fairly close to winning both awards in the same year, but since then he hasn't seem to give as much regard for the regular season. It is more likely that he could win another DPOY. Though he is great at creating his own shot, has developed as a passer, I have doubts he will significantly increase his offensive production to the level like Giannis, LeBron, Luka, etc.

2. Anthony Davis

Anthony Davis is on track to  finish top 4 in MVP voting and top 3 in DPOY. Considering he is the second offensive option next to LeBron, it's impressive he's this high in MVP voting. To be fair, AD has also dealt with lack of availability, but has come closer to winning MVP or DPOY than players like Embiid. Like Kawhi I think he has a better chance to win DPOY in the near future than MVP. Getting these awards will obviously depend on what he does in free agency, but assuming he resigns with the Lakers I think he would have an okay chance at winning both awards in the same year (assuming LeBron takes a step back at some point in the next few years).

1.Giannis Antetokounmpo

Giannis is already on track to win his second MVP this year and also on track to finish as the DPOY as well. Award voting will only be considering whatever games players played before suspension and Giannis has come the closest to winning both awards in the same year within recent years. So if we are talking about future seasons, unless Giannis gets injured I don't think there should be doubt that he has the highest chance of winning both awards in the same year within the next few years.",0.73,hot,2020-07-24 19:15:30
71,The Spurs Young Guns - Dejounte Murray,16,hx4lxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx4lxh/the_spurs_young_guns_dejounte_murray/,23,1595636015.0,"Hearing everyone associated with the organization repeating over and over again that these bubble games will be for the young guys got me properly fired up. We’ve waited all season to see these guys on the court together, and they didn’t waste any time getting to it. In this series of posts I’ll look at how each Spur on a rookie contract is progressing, how they performed in their first game back, and what I hope to see the rest of this bubble. 

Dejounte Murray - The head of the snake when it comes to the teams young core. It’s easy to see how much excitement the organization has had for him over the last three years and the progression of his jump shot this season showed us a glimpse of the player he could become in the coming years. 

Defense
The havoc Dejounte can cause on the defensive side of the ball was still apparent on Thursday. While that didn’t manifest itself in counting stats, the film shows how he impacts defense by blowing up actions off ball, hounding ball handlers in the pick and roll, and seemingly being in 2 places at once. He’s incredible aggressive, but nearly always finds a way to recover. While not quite the outlier he was rebounding the ball during his second season, he remains elite for his position and can truly impact the game giving the team extra possessions and pushing the break. He could be more disciplined in his rotations and attacking the glass, but in reality nothing on the defensive side of the ball gives me pause. 

Offense
On the other side of the court things are still very much a work in progress. He has always had great touch with his floater and we saw that Thursday. Multiple times he hit a little half runner/half jumper in the lane to avoid the contest from the big, and while he has become very efficient at that shots, the reason he has needed to use it so much is concerning. DJ struggled mightily to finish at the rim with the Lopez brothers and Giannis waiting in the wings. While he has very good vertical pop, he is not strong enough to explode in traffic. Too often he is eaten up by the big, who hardly even feels to the contact DJ initiates to try to get the shot off. His jumper didn’t look incredible today, but the foundation is there with his touch and improved form. The more he shoots the more comfortable he will become, and I am very high on his shooting upside considering his development arc. His passing is always an adventure. I am still not sure if he has the requisite vision needed to really drive a high level offense. He makes some really nice passes occasionally, but he hardly makes reads that show he understands the rotation the defense is going to make and how to actually maximize that advantage. He’s okay at hitting shooters in the pick and roll, but is much better hitting the roller where he can find creative angles to make the pass in a crowded space. I think he has the upside to be an All Star PG, but that is driven by his scoring ability and defensive playmaking. I think he will be best utilized in an offense with at least one other perimeter player with plus vision and creation equity if he doesn’t make a leap in that regard. 

Scrimmage Recap
The scrimmage for Dejounte really felt like an extension of the season. When he’s being aggressive attacking in PnR and in transition he can be really dangerous, but if his shot isn’t falling it can muck up his whole game. Having athletic defenders alongside him that can rotate well and cover for when he gets overeager is important, and I think the lineup with Derrick White and Lonnie Walker starting alongside him has a ton of upside. 

Looking Forward 
What I am looking for most through the rest of the bubble games from Dejounte is first improved chemistry playing with DWhite. I think he is a perfect foil for DJ (as long as Derrick actually shoots 3’s, more on that in my next post). He’s very steady in his rotations and very rarely gambles. He’s significantly sturdier than DJ and the two of them could make the best defensive backcourt in the league. DWhite also offers a little more passing vision and a steadier hand when running the offense, which helps paper over some of DJs limitations. Allowing DWhite to bring up the ball up and initiate the offense will give Dejounte more opportunity to shoot off the catch, attack close outs, and poach offensive rebounds. More specifically to Dejounte’s game, I would like to see some growth from him as a passer, using his quickness to break down the defense and punish teams for sending an extra man. With some added weight this offseason I think he’ll find ways to finish better around the basket (remember he is still coming back from a torn ACL where he got down to about 160 pounds at 6’4, so this season was always going to be tough) and I think his shooting will continue to improve. If he is going to make the leap into being the teams best player and leader moving forward a little improvement in vision and pass accuracy would go a long way.",0.94,hot,2020-07-24 17:13:35

The sidelines are much wider out of bounds, and the baselines have plenty of stopping room. The floors themselves are likely the same size, but the lack of peripheral people along the court boundaries provides tons of new, safe space for player movement.

No more worries about crashing into chairs (there's a solid wall), nor getting bashed by a camera. 

Will players get used to this improved safety boundary so that they will need it when teams return to arenas with fans?

Personally, I think players would be better off if the floors were clear always like this.

I think additional cameras will eventually be added, but perhaps with distancing concerns they will opt to use higher magnification and film from a distance.

82,"After a relatively disappointing 26-14 start to the 1989-90 season for the Pistons, head coach Chuck Daly inserted Dennis Rodman into the starting lineup. The Detroit went on to win 25 of their next 26 games.",610,hweumt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hweumt/after_a_relatively_disappointing_2614_start_to/,33,1595536472.0,"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rodmade01/gamelog/1990/  
  
For more context, In 1989 the Pistons won 63 games and swept the Lakers in the finals. To be playing at *just* a 53 win pace early through the first half of the season was very disappointing for the Pistons who were widely expected to be competing for a championship again.  
  
After 40 games, Rodman had yet to start for Detroit, however his immediate addition to the starting lineup was the spark for the Pistons. His defensive impact and offensive rebounding ability saw the Pistons regain their elite form which would see them finish 1st in the East and 2nd in the entire league standings.  
  
He was acknowledged accordingly this season winning his first of two DPOY's in a close call with Hakeem Olajuwon. People acknowledge Rodman for his elite defence and for being arguably the GOAT rebounder and this instance here shows why.  
  
After conceding the fewest points in the league in 1990, the Pistons would repeat that feat in 1991 and 1992 with Rodman starting nearly every game. In his first season with the Spurs beginning in 1993 the team conceded the second fewest PPG against in the league after being 9th the year prior. He truly was a massively impact player, regardless of how you value the supporting cast around him.",0.98,hot,2020-07-23 13:34:32

After center Clint Capela was shipped out of Texas and 3&D-specialist Robert Covington was launched into Houston to create a positionless, undersized starting lineup, the Rockets have been one of the league's most unique and entertaining teams. In addition to unleashing a newly-efficient Russell Westbrook on offense with the spacing accrued via eliminating a traditional center, the Rockets' defense has become quite interesting as well, forced to defend teams sans a 7-foot rim-protector.

This is far from the first time we've seen the Rockets going small, mind you. PJ Tucker was used very often at the 5-spot in the Rockets' previous two postseason tussles against the all-conquering KD-Warriors, stretching the Dubs out with shooters and taking one of the strongest offenses ever out of their rhythm with their switching defense.

From [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-with-robert-covington-radical-rockets-are-going-small-and-thinking-big-on-defense/):

>*""With defense, we think you have to start at the perimeter and be solid there,"" (Rockets GM) Daryl Morey told USA Today's Mark Medina. ""Unfortunately, rim protection is really difficult these days with the rules that they are if a guy is getting downhill. It's very hard even if the center is back to handle that. You have to cut off penetration at the start with a strong perimeter and then get the rebound and get out and go.""*

>*You don't need rim protection if you don't let anybody near the rim in the first place. And the Rockets, with their commitment to switching and their collection of strong, quick wings, believe they have the personnel to prove it. This is a big swing. Houston ranks 15th in defensive rating, and it needs to dramatically improve to win a title. Ideally, Covington will make the Rockets' defense look like the one that jammed up the Golden State Warriors' system in the conference finals two years ago and hasn't been the same since. That team was a pain to play against. Houston switched aggressively, with smart perimeter defenders like P.J. Tucker and Trevor Ariza who understood how to kill the rhythm of a possession. The results weren't beautiful to watch, exactly -- it essentially dared the other team to go matchup-hunting and try to score in isolation -- but the execution was impressive.*

#So individually, how have players performed since Covington joined the team?

The Rockets have now played 14 games with Covington on the floor before the NBA suspended its season. Here are some player averages since Covington officially entered the side:

Name| Games played (games started), Minutes| Pts/Rbs/Ast/Stl/Blk| FG% | 3PA, 3P% | TS%, rTS% (league-average TS% = 56.4)  
---|---|----|----|----|----
James Harden| 14 (14), 35.2| **29.4**/5.9/7.5/2.0/0.6| 43.1 | 11.4, 32.5 |  60.7, +4.3
Russell Westbrook | 11 (11), 35.9| **31.7**/8.2/5.5/1.7/0.2|  **54.6** | 2.4, 38.5|  **59.3, +2.9**
Danuel House Jr.| 14 (14), 27.5| 9.1/3.6/1.7/1.1/0.4| 42.9 | 4.6, 30.8 | 56.2, -0.2 
Robert Covington *(new addition)*| 14 (13), 32.6| 12.8/7.9/1.3/1.1/**2.5**| 42.1 | **8.0, 35.7** | 56.6, +0.2 
PJ Tucker| 14 (14), 31.5 | 6.0/5.9/1.3/0.7/0.7|  42.3 | 3.9, 40.0| 58.4, +2.0 

- **Westbrook** has taken up more more scoring duties (**31.7 ppg**, up from 26.4 ppg in 41 games prior). His efficiency (**59.3 TS%**, up from 52.4 TS%) has *exploded* with the improved 5-out spacing and better shot selection (fewer 3s) allowing him to attack the rim mercilessly, feasting in open space.


- **Harden**, in return, has ramped down his own scoring load slightly (29.4 ppg, down from 35.8 ppg in 47 games prior). His efficiency and playmaking have remained largely unchanged.


- **House** has seemingly become a mainstay in this new-look lineup, with his defense, hustle, plus-rebounding for his position (4 rebs/game), decent shooting (36.3 3p% on 5.3 3pa over the season), and passable ability to make plays off double-teams. **Eric Gordon** could replace House if he regains form, as he was a full-time starter during Houston's last postseason run and was highly effective in his role (18ppg, 60ts%, 40% from 3 on 8 3pa/game, plus-defense). **Jeff Green** (10/3/1 on 41% from 3) and **DeMarre Carroll** (6/3/1 on 62 TS%), brand-new Rockets, may see some postseason playing time as well if they continue to perform well, though that's never guaranteed considering MDA's notoriously stingy playoff rotations. **Austin Rivers** and **Ben McLemore** also provide important sparks off the bench with ancillary spacing and scoring.

#Covington and Tucker's defense

The Rockets are almost guaranteed to flourish on the offensive end, with 2 of the league's best offensive guards now surrounded by ample spacing, allowing the team to create Moreyball-friendly shots at the rim and 3-point-line almost at will. 

What will determine if they do go far in the playoffs, then, will be whether their undersized **defense** can slow down playoff offenses, and **Robert Covington and PJ Tucker** are key in determining whether Houston flourishes or flames out. 

**[Covington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eog0kLAZHyI)** is an All-Defensive forward capable of rebounding (8 rebs/game) and shooting 3s at a very high volume (8.0 3pa/game), but his most important role on this team is being one of the NBA's most disruptive and impactful team defenders, both willing *and* able to switch onto bigs and provide effective weakside rim-protection (2.5 blks/game). [As Daryl Morey himself has asserted](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-with-robert-covington-radical-rockets-are-going-small-and-thinking-big-on-defense/), *""He's very good off the ball, knowing how to position himself, anticipate, get steals, deny passing lanes"".* On the ball, RoCo's no Kawhi but he's still a highly capable man-defender: his 7-2 wingspan and sprightly frame combined with great footwork and positioning allow him to bother anyone he's switched onto. 

**[Tucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVoceFL96E)**, in addition to being a good outside shooter (37% from 3 on 4.3 attempts/game in last 3 seasons) and rebounder (7 rebs/game this season), is the defensive hub of this team and their do-it-all small-ball center on defense. He can switch onto any player in the league, with excellent footwork enabling him to keep up with [shifty guards](https://i.imgur.com/mXymyzg.gifv) and his strength and powerful hands allowing him to [bother bigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVoceFL96E&t=34s) in the post - Tucker is 6-6 and 245 pounds, built like a middle linebacker. He's also very cerebral, knowing opponent tendencies and often beating players to their spots. PJ is constantly communicating with the rest of his teammates, calling out switches and consistently making smart and effective rotations of his own (he is 4th in the NBA in charges drawn). 

**When on the court together, they've been incredibly effective defensively so far.**  [According to SB Nation's Mike Prada](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/3/4/21163408/houston-rockets-robert-covington-p-j-tucker-defense-rim-protection), *""Houston allows teams to shoot just 59.1 percent at the basket with that combination (PJ and RoCo) in the game, according to [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/11/lineups?on=739&on=3715#tab-shooting_defense_fg). That’s on par with the Lakers’ mark when Anthony Davis and JaVale McGee share the floor... 2.5 percentage points better than the 76ers surrender with Joel Embiid on the court, nearly three percentage points better than Jazz opponents shoot with Gobert on the floor.""*

So, how have they accomplished this?

Well, PJ and RoCo ""aren’t rim protectors, but they do everything a great rim protector does, along with so much more."" 

>Their lateral quickness is solid, but that’s not why they are able to stop so many different kinds of drives before they get to the rim. The reason they do is they have chests and hips of steel. To be successful at staying vertical and altering shots at the basket, one needs a strong enough chest to absorb a blow without losing balance and lowering your hands. Great perimeter defense in the anti-handcheck era is also about having a strong enough chest to absorb a blow without losing balance. Covington and Tucker, then, are essentially maintaining verticality, except further out on the floor.

>Tucker and (especially) Covington also eat up space as help defenders. Both are adept at swarming to the ball, and both do an excellent job of helping the helper so the next pass isn’t open. They ensure the weak Rockets defenders aren’t exposed in space.

>How does this make the Rockets tough to score against at the hoop when both share the floor? Consider the build of a prototypical rim protector: tall, strong, long, and able to keep those arms straight while in mid-air. Those traits seem essential because we think of big men as the type of players who can meet players at the apex of their jump. If P.J. Tuckington had to meet drivers at the apex of their jump, “he” will lose because “he” is not tall. But that’s only a problem if they actually reach the apex of their jump. By wedging their way into tight help positions and staying there due to the power of their lower body, Tucker and Covington ensure that anyone who tries to finish over them can’t in practice because they don’t have enough space to leap their highest.

>(Covington and Tucker) are each portable brick walls — or at least hand-held shields the Rockets can deploy anywhere. They allow the Rockets to string together crucial defensive possessions.

**Individually**, they're both shutdown artists: 

- PJ: harrassing and eventually denying [Kemba Walker](https://i.imgur.com/mXymyzg.gifv)  at the rim, shadowing  [Mike Conley's ](https://i.imgur.com/L0yq2Vb.gifv) drive to the rim and bothering his shot attempt, stone-walling [Daniel Theis and Gordon Hayward](https://i.imgur.com/T23fnJe.gifv).

- RoCo: picking up [Jaylen Brown](https://i.imgur.com/GPtpvFi.gifv), making himself a nuisance to [Donovan Mitchell](https://i.imgur.com/UrlpcqF.gifv), beating a spinning [LeBron James ](https://i.imgur.com/sN8zjpo.gifv) to his spot and forcing a turnover.

**Together**, they're poetry in motion, working in-sync beautifully to defend the paint and stop penetration, constantly helping the helper, plugging up gaps, and making timely and crucial rotations to keep the Rockets D humming:

#Early returns: Team performances

Results have been a mixed bag, with the Rockets going 8-6 in Covington's 14 games. 

**There are some impressive wins in there**: 1-point and 11-point wins vs Boston, a 10-point win vs the Lakers, and another 10-point win vs Utah. Strong offense combined with a locked-in and stingy switching defense allowed them to hold their own and prevail against some strong sides, taking numerous opponent scorers out of their rhythm (LeBron's 18 pts on 45 ts%, Tatum's 15 pts on 40 ts% and 32 pts on 48 ts%, Kemba's 14 pts on 32 ts%, Bojan 12 pts on 48 ts%).

**The losses, though**, range from more 'reasonable' ones that at least came against other playoff sides (15-point blowout loss vs Clippers, 1-point loss vs Jazz), to **a string of head-scratching upsets by below-.500 teams** (36-point massacre at the hands of the Suns, 2-point loss vs Knicks, 9-point loss vs Hornets, and a 20-point thwacking by the Magic). 

Some of this may have been a matter of size-disadvantage or Houston seemingly dialing down their effort-levels against lesser opposition and paying dearly for it: **they were out-rebounded by Phoenix 29-51, by the Knicks 34-65, and by the Magic 38-49.**

The **Clippers** didn't hold a significant rebound-advantage (57-51, shoutout to WB's 15 rebs) and Paul George had a rough offensive outing against the Rockets' switching defense (13pts on 43 ts%) but Kawhi remained as efficient as ever (25/6/5 on 66 ts%), while Clippers bigs **Zubac and Harrell both feasted** in the paint (17/12 on 98 ts% and 19/10 on 71 ts% respectively). Combined with an **extremely cold Harden shooting night** (4-17 fg, 36 ts%) and an **inefficient Westbrook one** (46ts%), it was not awfully surprising that Houston lost this game.

As for the 9-point loss to the Hornets, Westbrook missed this game. Houston actually outrebounded their opponents for once (42-30), but Harden's inefficient and relatively sloppy offensive night (53 ts% and 10 turnovers) as Houston's sole playmaker likely sealed Houston's fate, combined with white-hot shooting (67 ts%) from the entire Hornets team.


#All in all...
Houston had a +1.5 net rating in these 14 games. This is likely weighed down slightly by some of those aforementioned ugly blowout defeats (outscored by 56 points combined vs the Suns and Magic).  **Against good teams, the Rockets have been quite competitive on the whole: 4-2 record against teams w/ above .500 record, with a +2.7 net rating.** As long as they're locked-in and remain healthy, Houston absolutely have a fighter's chance of punching above their weight during the upcoming postseason run.

98,Opinion of GOAT after the Last Dance?,0,hx3dug,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx3dug/opinion_of_goat_after_the_last_dance/,134,1595631948.0,"As someone who is a serious NBA history aficionado I knew pretty much all the stories leading into the Last Dance and I already thought Jordan was the greatest and this series just backed it up for me...but did anyone, say a Lebron fan or a Kareem fan, watch this series and come out with a changed opinion? What’s your reasoning behind who’s the greatest?

Edit: my opinion is that Lebron is the greatest ATHLETE to play a sport. His longevity, build, speed strength and all that is insane. But I think Jordan is a superior player, winner and is the greatest.",0.5,hot,2020-07-24 16:05:48
99,"During a 15 game stretch in 1987, the Lakers went 14-1, behind some ridiculously great point guard play out of Magic Johnson.",61,hwiwkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwiwkh/during_a_15_game_stretch_in_1987_the_lakers_went/,21,1595551006.0,"I was just looking at the game log for Magic in 1987, since most people agree it was the peak of his career. From mid February to mid March of 1987, the Lakers played 15 games. They won 14 of them. However, what really caught my eye was how elite Magic played during that specific stretch. 

He averaged 23.7 PTS, 16.1(!) ASTs and 7.4 TRB, on 57.5% FG. 1.5 STLs and 4.3 TOVs. 

The Lakers as a team scored 128, 121, 138, 122, 136, 143, 125, and 147 points in a game at different points during this stretch. 

Interestingly, they only scored under 100 points twice during this 15 game stretch, and both times were against the Phoenix Suns, back to back on Feb 24th and 25th. They scored 97 and 99, and won both games. 

I think when people who weren’t able to watch Magic play (like myself) see his numbers and how stacked teams were, we tend to not fully understand how good he was. He was clearly a basketball savant who is one of those players that impacted winning and rarely, if ever, had a time where he was putting up empty stats. If Magic was on that night, which was often, the Lakers were absolutely unstoppable. 

The Lakers went on to be the 1st seed in the West, and defeated the Boston Celtics in 6 games to win the NBA Championship. 

Magic won Finals MVP averaging 26-13-8 and 2.3 steals on 54% from the field, capping off possibly the best season we have ever seen out of a point guard.

Just want to give all the younger people like myself some frame of reference when they’re quick to put anyone in the same tier as Magic, he is in a league of his own!",0.88,hot,2020-07-23 17:36:46

104,"How to make the ""draft lottery"" process better",0,hwzifr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwzifr/how_to_make_the_draft_lottery_process_better/,42,1595615972.0,"Hi guys,  this is my first post so apologies if there are formatting issues.  

I haven't looked through previous posts on this so apologies if someone else has voiced this.

What we do first, is remove the draft lottery process altogether, and replace it with a play in tournament for the top 4 draft picks.  This tournament can run in line with the NBA playoffs but it doesn't have to, if it's deemed to be too much basketball. For those picks that are 5 to 14 (lottery picks) these are then determined based on your NBA record.

The traditionally projected top two teams get a bye into the second round in order to make the bracket fill out.  If there is an expansion of 2 teams into the league you may wish to give the 2 teams, the top 2 picks going into the next 2 or 3 seasons and then following the introductory period to the league, the new teams would be required to enter the now 16 team bracket.  During the introductory period the 2 new teams would play each other for the first overall pick, in a best of three series

What this always for is the league expansion teams giving opportunities to Gleague, free agency, street ball players, to show their skills and potentially get semi pro/professional minutes.

The brackets would be organised in such a way that the teams with the lesser NBA record would have top seeds and they would play the team that would traditionally be expected to have the last pick in the lottery.  The brackets are not sorted by conference but by NBA ranking.

Obviously, this would lead to many expecting the 14th ranked team (the best of the teams to not make the NBA playoffs) so to remove this, we take the point difference  between starting fives during the season as a points handicap per game.  Each series is a best of 5 series with the final being best of 7 series.

It works in the trade market although I do need some ideas to make this better.  I will acknowledge that this is a little convoluted  but hear me out.

This could be introduced during the next CBA or if you're wanting to start on an even playing field, introduce it when the currently traded draft picks are finally selected.

Examples

If the 2nd seed pick belonging to  team A in the tournament is traded to team B that is also in the tournament,  then team B gains the 2nd seed along with their own pick seed.   

If the 2nd seed pick belonging to team A in the tournament is traded to team C  that has made the NBA playoffs, then team C enters the draft pick tournament (as the 14th pick, measured by NBA record if there are multiple team C in that years draft selection).  Team C also remain in the NBA playoffs.   Because Team C are in two tournaments they must nominate a squad for playoffs and another for the tournament.   Those in the playoff squad can only play in the draft pick tournament if they haven't played a professional game in 2 weeks due to injury.    Those who were nominated as the draft pick tournament squad would be permitted to play in the nba playoff tournament if there is an injury to a playoff played

In this circumstance, Team C can now allow for opportunities for gleague players, free agency players, street ballers, the opportunity to try to gain contracts by having the draft pic tournament on TV.

It also gives Assistant coaches the opportunity to act as Head coaches during the draft pick tournament, if both tournaments are at the same time.",0.47,hot,2020-07-24 11:39:32

106,Players who can have their Jersey Retired on 3 Different Teams,28,hwiv8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwiv8y/players_who_can_have_their_jersey_retired_on_3/,59,1595550891.0,"The only player to get their jersey retired on three teams was Wilt Chamberlein. This shows how much free agency has changed throughout NBA history and how players are in search of a better situation at that moment and more prone to leave. All of these players are entering/still in/just leaving their prime

3. Kawhi Leonard

I have Kawhi higher on this list simply because we don’t know if Toronto, and possibly San Antonio, will retire his jersey. In San Antonio he did create a big fuss and demanded a trade: He was there for only a handful of years and set the franchise back when he left. However, he did win a Championship and DPOY twice with them. I personally believe he has done enough to get his jersey retired there, but there still may be some unknown tension between him and the franchise. Toronto is also somewhat iffy since he came in, won, then dipped. This was their first championship ever though, and it wouldn't have been possible without him, so I think there should be a decent chance Toronto retires his jersey. If Kawhi does win a chip as a Clipper, and possibly shows commitment by signing for and extended deal, I think he has a good chance of having his jersey retired by the Clippers too.

2. Kevin Durant:

Kevin Durant is already a lock for OKC, even if most OKC fans still hate him. 4 scoring titles and a championship run should be enough. Especially after 9 seasons with the franchise and being close to the player to play for OKC right next to Westbrook, KD deserves to have his jersey retired by OKC. I understand he didn't leave OKC on the best of terms, but just by how long he was there and how he gave the franchise some of its best seasons it has ever had he should be considered. Additionally, he did fulfill his contract and didn't force a trade that would have resulted in OKC probably getting a worse player than him. Golden state had already announced they are going to retire his jersey after his achilles tear. Now if KD can recover to at least 70% of what he once was he’ll make noise. The east is strong, but the Nets could have a good chance of making the finals if they perhaps add another piece. If KD were to win a championship or even have a fair amount of strong seasons with the team (more than 4 seasons), that drastically would increase his chances of getting his jersey retired by the Nets.

1. LeBron James

LeBron had some of his best prime years with the Heat. He won 2 MVPS and 2 FMVPS with them. He was a crucial part in them winning, and will probably have his jersey retired there. For the Lakers, LeBron will have to win a championship or at least pick up an MVP. The Lakers have elite company among those who have had their jersey retired by the team. I feel like it should be very possible for LeBron to have his jersey retired by the Lakers simply, because we know the Lakers (assuming AD resigns) are and will be strong contenders for a couple years, and during that time I could easily see LeBron win a championship

Lastly, for Cleveland it’s up in the air. Sure LeBron had a couple good years there and won a championship, but I think he may be overshadowed by the legacy of Matthew Dellavadova. Delly was superior LeBron in almost every facet of the game during LeBron's second tenure in Clevland. I think LeBron has an okay chance of getting his number retired by the Cavs, but only if the media can shift their view from true greatness to LeBron",0.84,hot,2020-07-23 17:34:51

108,What's Next For The Atlanta Hawks? Part 3: Free Agency [OC],30,hwhwal,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwhwal/whats_next_for_the_atlanta_hawks_part_3_free/,11,1595547790.0,"This upcoming offseason the Atlanta Hawks are in a prime position to make a major acquisition through free agency. Their 48.4 million dollars in cap space is the most in the league and puts the Hawks in an interesting predicament. Do they want to commit big money to a high-end free agent or would they rather spend their money on role players on short term contracts? Today we will be looking at free agents that the Hawks should be looking to target in this upcoming offseason. We will separate these free agents into separate tiers (low-tier, mid-tier, and high-tier) based upon the predicted impact of said free agent. Without further adieu, let’s talk some Hawks.

Low-Tier Free Agents:

Micheal Kidd-Gilchrist:

MKG just had the worst season of his underwhelming career this last season. He struggled to stay on the court and even when healthy he had a hard time finding himself minutes on a middling Hornets team and a surging Maverick squad. MKG has offered little on offense in his career but the one thing he has always been solid at is defending. MKG could bring some much-needed perimeter and interior defense to this Hawks squad that ranked 26th in defensive rating this past year. MKG, in limited minutes, could bolster the Hawks defense as he could effectively defend opposing wings on the perimeter and offer a solid defensive presence on the interior. Now he’s not going to be doing much on the offensive end but the Hawks wouldn’t really need him to. MKG would serve as a rim roller and lob threat, no more. He could also set some screens and grab some boards but his offense is very limited. Let’s not even talk about that fugly jump shot (like seriously ew, that shit nasty). The Hawks could probably get MKG on a minimum contract considering he didn’t exactly torch the league this past season, putting up whopping averages of 2.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 0.6 assists. On a minimum contract, it’s a very low-risk deal and in my opinion, it’s a risk worth taking.

Torrey Craig:

Over the last two seasons, Torrey Craig has been a piece of some very strong defensive in Denver. He’s shown to be a very strong perimeter defender, occasionally locking down the opposing team's twos and threes and, at very least, making their life a bit more difficult. He’s the type of player to bring energy to the defense off the bench and make winning plays on that end. His 6’7 frame limits what he can do defensively against big men, but he does a good job of closing down passing lanes and providing help defense on the interior.

Craig’s no phenom on offense but he’s not an absolute zero. His shooting is a bit underwhelming, but he can definitely hit an open three (33% from three this season). He’s athletic enough to get to the basket on occasion, where he shoots a very respectable 71.4%. He is ineffective from the midrange, but luckily for his team, he’s not one to launch up a ton of dumb shots. His playmaking is underwhelming at best, however, he will not kill his team with a barrage of turnovers. Ultimately Craig is a smart, hardworking, hustler that could provide a quality defense and shooting on the court while also acting as a leader in the locker room. Craig is a restricted free agent this summer so the Hawks would need to be willing to outbid the Nuggets. I think the Hawks could get Craig at something like a two-year, 12-13 million dollar deal. If they can get him in that price range, I'd like to see Craig on the Hawks. 

Nerlens Noel:

If the Hawks are looking to upgrade at the backup five-position Nerlens Noel might just be their guy. Nerlens has had an up and down career up to this point but he seems to have finally found his footing in OKC. This season, Noel put up a mega efficient 7.7 point, 4.9 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1.5 blocks in just 18.4 minutes a game. On offense, Noel is your typical rim roller. He runs the pick and roll, finishes at the basket, and occasionally catches lobs. Noel is a serviceable post player, whipping out a fade away or hook shot every now and then. Over the years Noel has expanded his game to the midrange where he’s been semi-effective (shooting 33.3% between 15-19ft). Noel isn’t a playmaker but he is a smart passer. He’s good at getting the ball to players who then carry out a play. He does turn over the ball a bit more than you’d like but it’s not a serious problem. Let’s move on to his bread and butter, his defense.

Defense has been the one constant thing Noel has had going for him in his NBA career. He’s always been a good interior defender who’s more than capable of swatting shots right back at where they came from. Noel’s got the body to be a great NBA defender as he’s 6’10 and 220lbs however it’s his defensive IQ that really makes him what he is on defense. Noel is a great help defender, always covering his teammate's weak side and being in the position to contest shots. He’s an adept reader of passing lanes and is always ready to pounce on a misplaced place, it shows in his stats as well as he grabs a steal in just over 18 minutes a game. His perimeter defense is suspect, but at the center position, that is less essential. Noel is a strong rebounder, notching 4.9 rebounds a game, and an impressive 1.5 offensive rebounds a game for the Thunder. Out of all the cheaper options, Nerlens is probably my favorite for the Hawks. He’d be a very nice defensive piece off the bench, acting as a sort of unconventional sixth man. Noel could thrive next to a passer like Trae Young and really grow along with this team as he’s still only 25 years old. Noel will probably be looking for a longer-term deal with more guaranteed money but if the Hawks are willing to pay up he could be a very nice piece for them. 

Avery Bradley:

I know what you’re thinking, would Bradley really leave the Lakers to play for this young, inexperienced Hawks team. If the paycheck was large enough I think he would. Bradley has been a very solid player for the Lakers and I'm sure they’d like to retain him but I believe that if the Hawks wanted him bad enough they could get him. Bradley has always been a high-level defender and he would certainly bring experience and leadership on that end for the Hawks. Due to his elite perimeter defense, Bradley would take on the hardest defensive assignment between the two guards and help hide Trae’s piss poor defense. He could also net the Hawks some more steals with his excellent off-ball defense, leading to more transition opportunities for the team.

On offense, Bradley would act mainly as a spot-up shooter (similar to what he’s doing in L.A.). Bradley’s been a strong shooter for most of his career, which is good because you can never have too much shooting. Bradley won’t be out their making pinpoint passes or breaking ankles but he doesn’t need to. He is the epitome of a 3&D player. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Middle Tier Free Agents:

Kris Dunn: 

Kris Dunn has become a pretty underrated player in today's game. His lack of scoring ability has made him go under the radar for all the other things he can do on the court for you. Dunn has made a name for himself on the defensive end where he’s legitimately an all-defensive level player. I know counting stats don’t really paint a good picture of how good a player is defensively but let's just take a look real quick. In just 24 minutes a game Dunn snagged himself two steals a game (nearly three steals a game per 36). That’s super impressive and really highlights Dunn’s ability to read passing lanes and use his athleticism to capitalize on misplaced passes. Dunn would provide what Bradley does on defense except it would be like Bradley on crack cocaine. Dunn is a superior athlete compared to Bradley and at this point in his career a better lockdown defender. Dunn could clamp down on both point guards and shooting guard while still holding his own against some of the smaller wings. Dunn would be a perfect fit defensively next to Trae. He could take on the harder defensive assignment between the two and even use his defensive IQ to back up Trae when he needs it. 

Offensively Dunn, as I stated, is a bit limited. He can finish at the basket as he’s shooting roughly 64% on shots within five feet of the basket. But other than that his shooting is pretty atrocious, especially for a guard. He shoots below average from pretty much everywhere else on the court. His midrange stats are pretty gross and his three-point shooting is no better. The good thing is that Dunn doesn’t force up a ton of shots he's not good at. For instance, he only shot two threes a game this season. Luckily Dunn is a damn good passer who’s definitely capable of acting as a secondary playmaker. Dunn constantly makes smart passes, getting the ball to open shooters and cutters. He’s simply good at initiating the offense and getting the ball where it needs to go. In transition Dunn can be both a finisher and initiator, making well-aimed passes if he gets overwhelmed on his way to the basket. His fit next to Trae is excellent, he can help initiate the defense, allowing Trae to play off-ball while also covering for Trae’s lack of defense. When you take into account his age (25) it becomes even more clear how seamless a fit Dunn would be on the Hawks.

Paul Millsap:

How about a reunion! Millsap spent four excellent years in Atlanta where he made a name for himself by being a gritty defender and leader. Millsap has been a winning player his whole career and at the age of 34, that is yet to change. He’d bring some much-needed experience to the locker room. Millsap could really help the Hawks on defense where he would bolster their interior defense tremendously. Millsap would be able to use his size, strength, and length to keep the opposition from reaching the basket. His help defense would also pay major dividends for the Hawks as he could help make up for some of Capela’s and Collin’s shortcomings on that end. Millsap is also a useful perimeter defender as he’s quick enough to keep up with a majority of wings despite being on the older side. More than anything Millsap would give the Hawks defense a leader and a consistent defensive presence. He could help teach some of the young Hawks to learn defense and show bigs like Collins how to better perceive the game on that end of the floor. 

Millsap would also act as a solid offensive edition to the Hawks. Over the last seven years, Millsap has developed a pretty reliable jump shot. This development of his jumper has really shown out this last season where he shot a career-high three-point percentage (44%) on 2.5 threes a game. In fact, 25.6% of his shots came from catch and shoot situations from three. He’s also become quite proficient at making shots from the midrange, especially fadeaways. This season Millsap shot an impressive 50% from between 10-14ft away from the basket. At the basket, Millsap is a proficient finisher and low post player. Millsap uses his hulk-like strength to back down defenders and push past said defenders for put backs. He’s also quite a skilled post player, using a wide range of fakes, fades, and hook shots to get buckets. He’s a pretty skilled rebounder, he’ll use his strength to outcompete the opposition for rebounders. He’s also good at positioning himself for rebounds and boxing out players for the rebound. Playmaking isn’t really Millsaps thing. He’s not a bad passer, just a bad playmaker. He makes good decisions with the ball but he often misses open teammates due to a simple lack of vision. It’s all good though if you were the Hawks you really wouldn’t want the ball to be taken out of Trae’s hands anyway. Millsap would be an awesome addition to the Hawks, however, it might be tricky finding him enough playing time considering he’d have to split time with John Collins. But if they could make it work Millsap would definitely help the Hawks win more games. It’s just whether or not they’d be willing to play Millsap over some of their young players (mainly John Collins). Getting Millsap would be the type of move that would really highlight the direction of the Hawks. Are they going all-in on making the Hawks good now or are they going to take it slow? I guess we will have to see. 

Derrick Favors: 

Don’t let the stats fool you. Derrick Favors is a very good player. Whereas some players make their mark on the offensive end Favors has always been a defender first. He’s an absolute force on the interior, making opposing ball handlers second guess their decision to visit the paint. He’s a more than capable shot blocker, notching 1.3 blocks a game for his career. He’s not the type to be back down by other bigs either as he’s built like a fucking bulldozer (like holy fuck bud). He makes life hard for the opposition in the interior but how does he fare on the perimeter? Not great, he’s a bit slow on his feet so keeping up with guards and quicker wings is a bit of a problem for Favors. He’s better suited staying in the paint where he has less ground to traverse and he can focus on bodying everybody. Favors is also a great rebounder. This past season he grabbed 9.9 rebounds and 3.3 offensive boards. This was in large part because of his elite positioning as well as his ability slither around box-outs to get to the ball. 

Favors is mainly an interior scorer. He’s very reminiscent of the bigs of the NBA's past, using a variety of post moves to finesse his way to points. He also uses his size to his advantage finishing through heavy contests/contact. Said size is also used to push around defenders in the post, putting Favors in prime position for a dunk or put back. He’s also a quality roller to the basket, which would be great to have off the bench (assuming they don’t start him over Collins or Capela). Favors rarely shoot threes, however, he’s not opposed to shooting the occasional mid-range shot. He’s shown to be a decent shooter from within 14ft so there's that. But overall he’s a subpar shooter. Favors helps his teammates by setting hard screens, allowing his teammates to make plays, and get shots off. I’d love to see Favors on the Hawks. He’s the type of selfless, defensive anchor the Hawks need to take a step forward. Back in Utah, he came off the bench for multiple years with little fuss, which is a great sign that he would probably not start for the Hawks. Rather he would act as a sort of defensive based sixth man. In my opinion, the Hawks should favor Favors in free agency (god that was a shitty pun).

High Tier Free Agents:

Otto Porter:

The last two seasons haven’t been the kindest to Otto Porter. He went from being stuck in a reportedly toxic locker room in Washington and then was shipped to Chicago to play on the bottom-feeding Bulls. This last season Porter really struggled to stay healthy, leading to limited success on the court. When healthy Porter has been a very solid player, putting up 14.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2 assists on 50/44/83 shooting splits. He was a damn good offensive player, well suited to play as a third option. Porter is already a good shooter but he could really be optimized playing next to a transcendent player like Trae Young. He could spot in the corner for more threes. Porter would also benefit from being next to Trae as he would get more opportunities to act as the roll man in the pick and roll, where Otto has been quite effective (66.5% shooting within five feet of the basket in his last full season in Washington). Porter would add another shot creator to the Hawks lineup as he’s more than willing and capable of shooting from the midrange (55% 2017-2018 season) and from deep (44.1% on 4.1 threes a game). Porter uses his lateral quickness to dash by defenders and cut to the basket. He’s also become pretty solid at creating his own shot from outside, using fakes and hesitations to throw off the defenders timing and get the shot off. Despite Otto only averaging 1.5 assists for his career I’d argue that he’s actually a pretty effective passer. He’s shown to be an effective passer in the pick and roll, swiftly identifying the open cutter and nail him (pause) with a bullseye pass. In transition Otto is nothing special, he’s more than capable of finishing at the basket but he doesn’t have the Fox-like speed to be a premier threat in the full court. 

Defensively Porter is pretty solid. He’s not going to be getting an all-defensive team selection anytime soon but he’s no slouch either. Porter is quick on his feet, which allows him to keep up with a vast array of wings on the perimeter. He’s really effective at staying in front of his man and contesting shots at the basket. His interior defense is limited due to his lack of size and strength but he’s not a complete pushover. He’s long enough to make guards live hard at the basket but has a hard time not getting overpowered by big men. Porter would add another layer to both the Hawks defense and offense. He’d thrive as the third-option next to Young and Collins, getting plenty of open looks from three, the midrange, and at the basket. If Porter can stay healthy and go back to being the player he was back in the 2017-2018 season, he could be quite the pickup for the Hawks.

Bogdan Bogdanovic: 

Bogdan is coming off a career year in which he took the starting spot away from sharpshooter Buddy Hield. Bogdan was simply a more versatile player than Heild, both as a defender and scorer. He can score from anywhere on the court, making his own offense with finesse and skill. He shot 43.3% from the field, 36.1% from three on 7.2 attempts a game, and a career-low 72.4% from the line this last season (which is an outlier for his career). So yeah… he’s a damn good shooter. His playmaking is also pretty strong. He didn’t get to flash it a ton this season since Fox was deservingly the lead ball-handler and playmaker for the Kings but Bogdan is more than capable of leading an offense. He makes smart passes, finding open cutters and shooters. He’s the type of player that doesn’t make a ton of stupid decisions with the ball, which is valuable in itself. He’d also be a nice transition threat for the Hawks, both as a passer or finisher. His biggest contribution to the Hawks would lie in his shot creation ability as he’s quick enough and skilled enough as a ball-handler to get and make shots on his own. On offense, Bogdan would be a seamless fit next to the team's other young players.

Now onto the defense. Bogdan is by no means a terrible defender. He’s a decent perimeter defender who uses his quickness to stay in front of opposing guards. He’s not a very active off-ball defender however, he lacks spatial awareness at times. He’s not a particularly great help defender either since he sometimes struggles to read the floor. Like most guards, his defense on the interior is lacking. He can guard other guards but the second you put a big man on him in the post he’s fried chicken. He just simply isn’t big enough or strong enough to hang with 4’s and 5’s of the NBA. He is okay to slightly above average defender overall but if you're acquiring him you're doing it for what he brings on the offensive side of the ball. His fit on the Hawks is a bit more questionable than some of the other players we have listed as you’d ideally want an elite defender next to Trae at the other guard position but his offensive fit could be seamless. He could take up secondary ball-handling and playmaking opportunities, allowing Trea to play off-ball more. He could also lead the second unit at the point when Trae is sitting on the bench. That way they would always have a high-level playmaker in the game. It would certainly be a win-now move to pay big money for Bogdan. But if the Hawks are focused on winning now they should be prepared to pay a king's ransom as it will be hard to pry him away from Sacramento. 

Danilo Gallinari:

This would be the Hawks going all-in on offense. Gallo’s a straight-up bucket and he’d definitely bring some more shot creation to the lineup. His ability to hit from anywhere on the court would alleviate some of the scoring burden off of Trae shoulders and allow him to focus a bit more on facilitating the ball. Gallo would give them another player to give the ball in crunch time as he’s more than capable of making his own shot. He’s more than capable of getting you a bucket in the post as well, which could allow Collins to get more spot-up attempts from outside. Gallo wouldn’t fill the team's need for a secondary playmaker but his scoring would be more than enough to make up for it. Plus you don’t really want to take the ball out of Trae's hands unless you have to. 

Gallo’s a notably shaky defender compared to others on this list. He can provide serviceable defense on the interior, where he uses his length to block off areas and contest shots. Unfortunately, Gallo is pretty shitty as a perimeter defender. His lack of athleticism leads to players being able to blow by him with relative ease. I mean he’s not a traffic cone on that end of the floor. He has some ability to read the offense and position himself, but the overall defense just isn’t his forte. Of all the players we’ve spoken of so far, Gallo might just be the best out of all of them. He also might be the worst fit for the Hawks. True, his shot creation would alleviate the scoring burden that both Trae and Collins take on but his defense would undoubtedly hurt the team. You would be adding a subpar defender to one of the worst defenses in the league...no thanks. His age would also be an issue as he’s 31 years old. Gallo is a very good player, but I don’t think he’s the right player to put next to this young, burgeoning core.

Gordon Hayward:

Hayward doesn’t get enough love. After a gruesome leg injury a few years back many people wondered if he’d ever be the same player he once was. He’s yet to reach the highs that he did back in Utah but he’s still managed to be a high-impact player despite his setbacks. This year as the fourth option on a supremely talented Celtics team Hayward put up an impressive 17.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4 assists on all-around efficient shooting. That was as a fourth option! Sure Hayward may never be quite the same as he was in Utah but he’s still a really fucking good player. The stats back it up too, this season the Celtics net rating was +6.2 with Hayward playing. He’s another one of those all-around scorers, able to drive to the basket, hit from midrange, and snipe from deep. This shooting mixed with his high-level ball-handling skills make him a threat at all times as he could just as easily cut to the basket as he could pull up from deep. He could also take on that secondary playmaking role we’ve been talking about as Gordon is an above-average facilitator. He’s especially good at finding cutters to the basket and working as a passer in the pick and roll. Skills that would very much so come in handy next to Collins and Capela. 

How’s the defensive fit next to the rest of the Hawks? Well, Hayward is just alright on defense. His perimeter defense is solid, he can keep up with most wings. If he lets a ball-handler slip by him Hayward has the burst to chase his man down and still get up to contest the shot. His man to man defense is strong but his off-ball defense could use some work. He can be inconsistent on that end, which is problematic as Atlanta needs a consistent defensive presence, someone they can really rely on. His interior defense, as a whole, is underwhelming. He’s not as tall or heavy as some other wings, leading him to getting bodied in the post more often than not. Despite some of his defensive flaws I like the idea of the Hawks picking up Gordon Hayward (assuming he doesn’t pick up his player option). He’d slide right into the Hawks lineup as a shot creator and playmaker while not hurting them on defense. His game would add another dimension to the Hawks offense, a dimension that might just get the Hawks to the playoffs.

Side Note: I didn’t include Brandon Ingram on the list because I don’t see any way the Pelicans don’t match any offer that is given to him.

113,[OC] Jamal Murray Has Time on His Side,56,hwduhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwduhu/oc_jamal_murray_has_time_on_his_side/,14,1595531719.0,"With every fresh bout of inconsistent play, it feels like a few more people give up on the idea of Jamal Murray ever being the perennial All-Star many pegged him to be after his first season with Denver Nuggets. And to be fair, as the 2019-20 season stumbles into (maybe) the post-season, Murray is yet to feature – or even warrant much consideration – for that particular honour. However, those outside the Nuggets fanbase (who are kind of obligated to believe in Murray considering the 5yr/$170 Million contract the organisation signed him to) shouldn’t dump all their stock just yet. 

As has already been detailed by many, Murray can be an incredibly frustrating player to watch. On the one hand, there are games like the one he had himself against Memphis early in the season, where he posted a 39/8/4 stat line to go along with 3 steals, 7 made 3-pointers (on 12 3PA), and a +23 NetRtg. And then on the other, there are games like the one he had against Golden State just before the league-wide shut down, where he posted a 14/3/6 line while shooting 3/14 from the field and 0/6 from 3. And although every player goes through highs and lows – especially when said players are high-volume shooters who play the point – few are as volatile while Murray and less warrant his level of interest from the national media. 

All that being said, Murray is still young, and inconsistency comes with the territory. And all one has to do to remind themselves (and others) of just how much room a player like Murray has to grow is to study the past seasons of similar, yet more-established point guards. 

Below is a per game and advanced stats comparison of Murray and 4 guards that fit the above mould:

Player A (22yrs/4th season): 36.4 MP, 21.7 PTS, 5.2 AST, 1.5 STL, 1.9 TOV on 47/42/85 splits

Player B (22yrs/1st season): 38.6 MP, 19.0 PTS, 6.5 AST, 0.9 STL, 2.1 TOV on 43/37/84 splits

Player C (22yrs/2nd season): 33.6 MP, 18.6 PTS, 5.8 AST, 1.5 STL, 3.1 TOV on 48/44/93 splits 

Player D (22yrs/4th season): 32.8 MP, 18.8 PTS, 4.8 AST, 1.2 STL, 2.3 TOV on 46/35/89 splits

Player E (22yrs/2nd season): 34.9 MP, 17.7 PTS, 5.7 AST, 2.0 STL, 2.4 TOV on 42/32/80 splits

	Of the above: one is a two-time MVP, another played his age-22 season alongside perhaps the greatest player in history, and two others are both multi-time All-Stars each with at least one All-NBA nod. The other: Jamal Murray. 

Now, none of this to say that Jamal Murray will ever win an MVP award, make an All-NBA team, or even make an All-Star appearance (although for the record my money would be on no, yes, and multiple respectively). But rather, this post should serve only as a reminder that Murray (and other young players like him) should always be discussed in the proper context. Murray is young. He’s relatively inexperienced. He plays the hardest spot on the floor to master. **And he is the only point guard in the NBA who has to defer primary playmaking responsibilities to a seven-footer**. 

Sure, Murray is not the player we want him to be right now, but does that mean he’ll never be? Only time will tell.

Looking at Luka's holistic performance over the season I'd say he's overrated.

* Already has a supporting cast many stars in bad situations would dream of. So many shooters and lob catchers. Perfectly suited for both the modern NBA and Luka's game. 

* Mavericks do well without him in comparison to other superstars who drive their offense.

* I don't think he'll become a good shooter like many are expecting. His FT% (75%) is average. He shoots 32% on threes because he attempts Harden-level difficulty shots without Harden-level shooting. 

* Wasn't clutch this year due to aforementioned three bricking in crunch time. But he was clutch in his rookie year so who knows. 

* Stat stuffing is due to high usage and almost always handling the ball + initiating plays when on the floor. 

**The case for underrated**

This boils down to one thing: he might not have been healthy. 

* He started off the season AMAZING. Leading the league in WS/48, BPM, VORP. 

* Apparently he sustained injuries at some point? And was playing through them. While still good, his numbers dropped. 

* So, Luka might lowkey be the best player in the league already who could average an efficient 30 point trible double when completely healthy. 

**The case for properly rated**

He's usually rated 5th among healthy players this season. Honestly I don't really have a case that he should be exactly here. I think he should either be closer to first, or rated lower with players like AD, Jokic, Dame, Embiid ahead of him. What do you think?",0.64,hot,2020-07-23 18:23:39

Caruso was prepared to pay for private flights from Orlando to Austin and back, he said. He would leave after the Lakers' practice on July 17 -- the day before the wedding. He contemplated attending the ceremony, which was outdoors, and skipping the indoor reception. He looked into finding a ""safe house"" in the Austin area where he might be able to sleep after leaving the ceremony, but finding one on short notice proved impossible.

Last Thursday, two days before the wedding, he made his decision and texted his family: he would skip it. He had friends record ""basically the whole event"" and send him video, he said. Caruso spent his downtime over the weekend watching the footage in his room.

""There were some people that should have had masks on that didn't,"" Caruso said of the wedding. ""I would say 75% of the people had them on. Texas and Florida -- they can kind of be their own countries at times. Some people just like to do their own thing.""

He could not FaceTime into the wedding live because the reception was not good enough, he said. Caruso is sad, but at peace with his choice.

""If I was on a team that didn't have title aspirations -- a team trying to hold onto the No. 8 seed or something -- it might have been different,"" Caruso said. ""But we have worked too hard.""",0.96,hot,2020-07-22 04:06:34

A bunch of discussion in the comments of the more recent post was about SMOY candidates basically playing starter-level minutes. Some comments proposed setting a minutes limit, while others proposed not being allowed to be in the top 5 in minutes played per game on their own team. The second one intrigued me and so I went to work.

I'd already gotten the Basketball-Reference stats for another project. I decided to use VORP (value over replacement player) as my criteria, as it *seems* to be the best all-in-one stat.

**I removed players who had played less than 50% of a team's games, and only took players who were 6th to 9th in minutes played per game on their team.**

Here's who would win from 1983 (the inaugural award went to Bobby Jones) to 2020 if the criteria was highest VORP.

|2020|Nemanja Bjelica|PF|31|5|SAC|64|28.453125|1.7|

2020 showcases the main problem, which is being unable to account for trade deadline moves. Christian Wood is a top 3 candidate by VORP, but possibly accrued most of that after the trade of Andre Drummond.

Montrezl Harrell would have won last year. Lou Will and Brent Barry would be 3-time winners. Fat Lever, John Stockton, John Salley, Nate McMillan (current Pacers coach!) and Chris Mullin would all be two-time winners. There would be a tie in 2004 between Hedo Turkoglu and Shane Battier.

Montrezl would also have won under this method. Lou Will would be a 3-time winner. Bobby Jackson, Eddie Johnson, John Drew, Leandro Barbosa and Ricky Pierce would all be two-time winners.

139,Most MVP votes for players who never won MVP in the last 20 years,266,hvxfs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvxfs6/most_mvp_votes_for_players_who_never_won_mvp_in/,130,1595465863.0,"Looking back, there were so many great players who never won MVP. Even many who were so close to winning the MVP, or those that were just ""in the conversation"" a lot, but never got close.

So i devised a very simple formula to see who these people were. 

* Take the voting for players who have never won an MVP
* Divide by the maximum votes (since the scoring system fluctuates year to year) that year to devise a ""Almost-MVP score""
* Add it all up; simple as that, to get their ""Total Almost-MVP Score""

Do note that because I only went up to the last 20 years (could go further if I had time), some players who crossed the 90's into the 2000's were likely misrepresented just a little in the data in terms of how they impacted MVP races. Most notably Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Reggie miller etc.

I won't post the detailed year-by-year results in this thread, but you can find everything [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtarP_npuCJqAxK-j43167yazK-8TMB1AXWlF4RrRRE/edit?usp=sharing).

Onto the top 20:

|Player|Total Almost-MVP Score|
|:-|:-|
|1. Chris Paul|163.9|
|2. Dwight Howard|124.9|
|3. Kawhi Leonard|99.2|
|4. Tracy McGrady|85.5|
|5. Dwyane Wade|79.3|
|6. Jason Kidd|78.7|
|7. Anthony Davis|59.9|
|8. Chris Webber|54.5|
|9. Carmelo Anthony|45.3|
|10. Jermaine O'Neal|42.5|

Some observations about the top 10:

* This methodology generally skews towards one of two groups; people who were top 3 MVP voting in close races, or people who received MVP voting a lot. 
* Chris Paul is one of the rare cases where its both. In 14 seasons he received MVP voting in a whopping 8 different years (tied first with Wade), and will undoubtedly get some points this year as well. That combined with a 2nd place finish in 08, 3rd in 2012 and 4th in 2013 puts him deservedly at the top of the list
* Dwight was definitely the one that burned the brightest, only receiving votes in 5 years, but in those 5 years he was top 5 voting in 4, including a 2nd place finish
* Similarly, Kawhi only received votes in 4 years, but has a 2nd and 3rd place finish; lets assume in a few years he probably gets a lot more.
* McGrady also had 2 strong finishes, though I must say got a ton of votes even on those mediocre Magic teams
* Kidd is mostly on the list due to his 2nd place finish against Tim Duncan, though since we aren't including the 90's he likely has much more
* Wade only had 1 big vote year, though got votes in 8 seasons.
* AD, Melo, Webber and Jermaine Oneal make the top 10 due to one high finish. 

Stray Observations

* A total of 73 players who have never won MVP have received at least 1 MVP vote in the last 20 years
* Of those, 17 players have received exactly one 5th place MVP vote. They are (from most recent) Klay Thompson, Mike Conley, Ty Lawson, David Lee, Stephen Jackson, Antawn Jamison, Rasheed Wallace, PJ Brown, Marcus Camby, Michael Redd, Jamal Mashburn, Mike Bibby, Anthony Mason, John Stockton, Darrell Armstrong, Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose (the last 2 in the same year while both on the Pacers).
* Marcus Camby, PJ Brown and Darrell Armstrong all received a vote despite never having made an all-star team. Though each had their own hardware (and were better than Jamal Mashburn)
* In addition to those 17, 11 players also received votes only once: Andrei Kirilenko, Sam Cassell, Brandon Roy, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, John Wall, Isaiah Thomas, Victor Oladipo and Jimmy Butler
* Of the players who only received votes once, Isaiah Thomas has far and away the most points (8) with a fifth place finish. 
* Of the players who only received votes twice, Paul George and Joakim Noah are way ahead of everyone else.
* Tony Parker got votes in 7 years, but finished outside the top 5 in voting in 6 of those years
* Players most likely to move way up on this list in a decades time (if they don't win an MVP) will be Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic
* The most votes without ever receiving a top 5 finish in multiple years are Paul Pierce (4.1 in 5 years), Amare Stoudemire (6.3 in 4 years), Ben Wallace, (6.63 in 3 years), Vince Carter (5 in 3 years) and Lamarcus Aldridge (3.1 in 3 years)
* Yao Ming, Michael Finley and Joe Johnson share the distinction of only ever receiving a single 5th place vote in multiple years. 

**TL;DR -** Of players who never won an MVP in the last 20 years, Chris Paul and Dwight got the most votes. There's other stuff too. Thanks for reading.",0.98,hot,2020-07-22 17:57:43

141,"[OC] Ahead of the re-start, lets look at where every team likes to shoot from (relative to league average)",337,hvv6ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvv6ua/oc_ahead_of_the_restart_lets_look_at_where_every/,99,1595458471.0,"tl;dr: [This chart shows how often each team shoots from the various parts of the court relative to league average. Darker areas indicate a higher amount of attempts from the corresponding area relative to the rest of the league.](https://imgur.com/UPAarqF)

***

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/UPAarqF), I show how often each team shoots from the different parts of the court, relative to league average. Darker areas on the court indicate a higher amount of volume from the corresponding area compared to the rest of the league. 

For example, take a look at the patch of dark red +30 feet from the hoop on the Atlanta Hawks chart. That means the Hawks (read: Trae Young) take more shots from that part of the court than any other team. 

Meanwhile, the Spurs have a blanket of black in the mid-range. Accordingly, they take more mid-range shots per game than anyone else (the next closest is Indiana).  

It's pretty easy to pick out certain players impact on their teams' shot selection 

* Melo's antiquated shot selection in Portland 
* CP3's signature elbow jumper 
* The pick and pop game of Brogdon and Sabonis in Indiana 
* AD's baseline jumper game in LA
* PJ Tucker and the rest of the Houston Rocket Corner Threes 

Note that blank areas show where a team shoots at or below league average volume. For example, the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets have almost no color in the mid-range because they take at or less than the league average number of attempts from that part of the court. A team like the Celtics takes roughly a league average number of attempts from almost all parts of the court, which is why their whole chart is mostly blank. 

*** 

**Methodology:**

I charted every shot taken this season (2019-20) and binned them into similarly sized hexagons. I then found out the league average number of attempts from each hexagon and calculated how many standard deviations away from the mean each team was from each hexagon. The darker the color on the chart, the higher the deviation. A team taking a league-average number of attempts from each location would have a blank chart.

2006 he has no argument. His team wins 54 games (I don't care about injuries because that has never helped other MVP candidates before when they also had to deal with injured teammates) which is 4th best in the league and 3rd in the West. So he doesn't even fall within the conventional ""top 2 seed"" that most MVPs are.

Is anyone really going to argue he was better than Lebron, Kobe, Dirk, Chauncey Billups or Dwayne Wade that season?

Here goes:

STARTERS

PG: Chauncey Billups = **Kyle Lowry**. Two highly durable floor generals who can run an efficient offense, hit their shots, and operate with a pass-first mentality. Lowry is a bit more active on the boards, but their offensive game is extremely similar.

SG: Dahntay Jones = **Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot**. Jones was probably the weakest SGs the Nuggets have started over the last decade+, but was able to fill the starting lineup while J.R. Smith came off the bench. Jones was a bit more of a facilitator, but neither he nor Luwawu-Cabarrot were really asked to do much other than stand around with their hands open.

SF: Carmelo Anthony = **Pascal Siakam**. Both reliable offensive juggernauts and skilled No.1 options. Siakam is naturally more of a big, but Melo was beginning to rely more on his size at that point in his career and even showed flashes of his defensive capabilities (though there's really no comparison with Siakam's). Still, they're both elite scorers and strong rebounders, and while it's hard to make comparisons to players of Melo's caliber, I see a lot of similarities when I watch Siakam's one-on-one game (especially with the added mobility and range this year). Overall, the Lowry/Siakam combo reminds me a lot of Billups/Melo, and I think it works. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5\_2WDJe0Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5_2WDJe0Lo)

PF: Kenyon Martin = **Thaddeus Young.** Both 31-years old and declining, but still valuable on the defensive end. Kenyon Martin was great at getting into passing lanes and earning fast break opportunities similar to Young. K-Mart was more of a blocker in his day, but both players are good at cleaning up the glass and fulfilling their role.

C: Nenê = **Jaxson Hayes.** Sometimes overlooked by defenses, but about as solid offensively as you can get. Jaxson is much more mobile, but is also 7 years younger than '09 Nenê, and I could see him growing into that type of player as he adds more mass and experience (perhaps with a few more modern touches). Hayes is already a strong rebounder despite his lean frame and has shown flashes of Nenê's defensive versatility that will only improve as he learns to avoid fouls.

BENCH

J.R. Smith = **Bogdan Bogdanović**. Two deadly 3-pt snipers despite some streakiness. Bogdanović fills the same psuedo-6th man role on the Kings that J.R. filled on the '09 Nuggets, but when either one gets hot, they can take over the game. J.R. was a more aggressive offensive player, but both are decent facilitators as well.

Anthony Carter = **Rajon Rondo.** As above, both are 33-years old and are still valuable distributors and pass disruptors, but are often more liability than asset. Rondo seems to have lost some interest defensively (perhaps due to injuries), but you could do worse.

Linas Kleiza = **Jeff Green.** Green is already nearly a decade older than Kleiza was at this point, but their career trajectories meet pretty well in the middle. Green is really more of a defensive-minded 4 than Kleiza (who primarily played the 3), but both were decent catch-and-shoot options.

Chris Andersen = **JaVale McGee.** JaVale is probably the closest we have to Birdman in terms of monster blockers with generally underwhelming skillsets otherwise. McGee is more involved in the offensive scheme though, so he's not quite as strictly the defensive role player as Andersen was.

Renaldo Balkman = **Taj Gibson.** Gibson is a shell of his former self while Balkman was always kinda trash. He was actually a bit more of a craftier defender than Gibson is now, but I'm sure playing defense on the Knicks is just demoralizing, so I give Taj a pass here.

Johan Petro = **Dewayne Dedmon.** We traded for Petro halfway through the season (actually giving OKC the pick that became Taj Gibson) but he never really saw the floor too much. If he'd had a bit more of an opportunity, he probably would've looked similar to Dedmon (he's improved since moving back to Atlanta, but I'm still not sold. Don't forget he's nearly 31, too). Petro was a legit 7-footer like Dedmon, so he was able to catch a few rebounds, but didn't quite have Dedmon's defensive capabilities to be able to stick around in the league.

Jason Hart = **Frank Mason III.** Garbage time point guards that once showed some flashes but probably won't make it far in the league. Hart was able to use his size to some success defensively and they were both decent hustlers, but you really don't want them on the floor for long periods of time. Luckily Mason was able to take advantage of a two-way with Milwaulkee.

Anyway, let me know what you think of these comparisons. Taking ages and minutes into account, I think it's a decent looking team on paper, but how far would you see them going? Better or worse than the real deal Nuggets?",0.82,hot,2020-07-23 01:19:01

I'll leave my personal picks below and feel free to disagree.

Clippers: Its undoubtedly the Rockets, the Rockets stretch the floor out better than everyone and have been a matchup problem all year for the Clips. I think the Clips are really hard to beat on paper because this roster is unbelievable, but Houston's ability to score half their points on 3s is a terrifying thought, especially with their beefed perimeter defense against LACs stars

Bucks: I know their are Miami truthers, but I have to go Toronto. This team did it once and even though they don't have Kawhi, they have a new cutthroat star in Siakam. While Miami can stop Giannis, the goal of this series isn't to stop Giannis, it's to stop the Bucks and Miami just doesn't have the offensive firepower that Toronto does while still maintaining elite defense. The Raptors have an uphill battle to win this series but they have a punchers chance.

Lakers: I struggled most with this one because I think while the Lakers to me are the scariest team this year they also feel the most vulnerable. Since I already picked Houston I'll go with Denver. The Nuggets have size now, the only team in the West that can outsize the Lakers. I don't expect the Nuggets to run 3 centers but I think their height advantage and rim protection may be enough to slow AD and force the Lakers out to the 3pt line which is an area they aren't as comfortable in.

151,Thread I stole from twitter about the validity of some advanced stats.,16,hw8dr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw8dr1/thread_i_stole_from_twitter_about_the_validity_of/,19,1595503550.0,"According to BPM (OBPM, DBPM too)
which “estimates player contribution”,

Kobe (01-10) barely hooped at an All-NBA level (6.0 BPM is thought of as an All-NBA player, Kobe was at 5.7).

Stephen Curry from 2014-16 has a higher DBPM (1.5) than Gary Payton did from 1995-97 (1.2).

Klay Thompson since 2016 has a - 1.7 DBPM. For comparison, James Harden  (1.1), Kemba Walker (-0.5) and Damian Lillard (-0.6) were all apparently superior on defense. 

LeBron in 2009 was a better defender (3.7 DBPM) than Tim Duncan (3.3) and Ben Wallace (3.5) ever were.

Manu Ginobili in 2005 was as good as/better (6.9 BPM) than Michael Jordan in 1998 (6.9 BPM), Kevin Durant in 2019 (5.5 BPM), 2017 Steph Curry (6.9 BPM), 1984-86 Magic Johnson (6.7 BPM), and all but 2 seasons of Kobe Bryant’s 20 year career (5.9 or less).


Bruce Bowen from 2003-08 (his peak) apparently defended worse (1.6 DBPM) than current day Donte DiVincenzo (2.7 DBPM). While we’re on the subject of Donte, his current season is better (DBPM wise) than the best of Kobe’s, Payton’s, Wade’s, Kidd’s, Butler’s, and Holiday’s careers.

Horace Grant (11.4 BPM) apparently matched Michael Jordan’s brilliance (11.5 BPM) in G4 of the 93 Finals....or did he? 

Jordan: 55/8/4 on 61.2% 
Grant: 17/16/2 on 62.3% 

In last years Finals, Siakam’s 32/8/5 in G1 (17.7 BPM) was better than Curry’s 47/8/7 in G3 (17.2 BPM).

Moving on to VORP (basically how much better a player is than the worst player in the league). 

Harden in the 2018 playoffs (1.6 VORP) was about as good as Hakeem in the 1995 playoffs (1.7 VORP). 

Chris Paul from 2008-09 (19.2 VORP) > 2x MVP Tim Duncan from 2002-03 (15.7 VORP).

Kawhi’s 2019 playoff run (2.9 VORP) is as good as the best run Michael Jordan’s ever had (2.9 VORP in ‘92).

LeBron’s 17’ playoff run (33/9/7 on 65% in 18 games with a 2.2 VORP) was BARELY better than LeBron’s infamous 11’ playoff run (24/8/6 on 56% in 21 games with a 2.1 VORP).


1h
2019 Nikola Vucevic (5.5 VORP) is apparently better then any version of Steve Nash (peaked at 5.3), Dwight Howard (peaked at 5.4), and better than all of AI’s seasons except 2001. 

On to Win Shares (basically how many wins a player is responsible for). 

JaVale McGee (4.5 WS) is more valuable to the Lakers this year than Russ (4.3 WS) is to the Rockets. 

Based on his rankings in DWS and DBPM, Nikola Jokic is a top 10 defender this year..

In 2019 Russell Westbrook (5 DWS) was more valuable defensively to OKC than DPOY Finalist Paul George (4.9 DWS). 

These barely scratch the surface, there’s dozens more, but the point of this is: if advanced stats play a big role in your evaluation of players, ...Grimacing face 

From what I’ve gathered, the only advanced stat that’s good is multi-year RAPM. Efficiency stats like eFG% and TS% (my favorite) are good too.

152,[OC] Defining Defensive Success,13,hw85j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw85j7/oc_defining_defensive_success/,0,1595502621.0,"I'm just an average Joe who really likes defense, and as such, I'm on a quest to clear up misconceptions about how defense works. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/h9srqd/quick_oc_have_defenses_really_gotten_worse/), I attempted to address idea that defenses have gotten worse over time by showing the leagues increase in offensive rating is mostly if not entirely explained by the increase in 3 point attempts and that, relative to offenses, defenses are as good as they've ever been.

This time I want to tackle the idea that ""good offense beats good defense"" or ""offense is more important than defense."" To be absolutely clear, I'm talking about *team* offense and *team* defense, and to compare the two, I'd have to be able directly compare what constitutes success for defense and how it compares to what constitutes success for offense. Let's start simple with defense, a defense is successful when they prevent the offense from scoring, this can be approximately calculated using this formula (all numbers are taken from NBA.com's per 100 possessions stats page):

(FGA - FGM - OFF REB) + TOV% + (100 + OFF REB - FGA - TOV%) x FT%^2.2

Basically, this formula calculates what percentage of the time the defense gains possession of the ball via either 1) a missed field goal attempt that does not result in an offensive rebound, 2) a turnover, or 3) a trip to the free throw line (not caused by an ""and 1"") and all free throws are missed. It's not a perfect formula, I have no way of tracking how often the offense keeps possession after a shot attempt because the ball goes out of bounds last touching a defender, or the actual average number of free throw attempts per trip to the line (I pulled 2.2 out of my butt), it also assumes all free throw shooters are average, but the number should be within an acceptable margin of error. When you plug in the numbers, you get that the defense was successful at keeping the offense from scoring this season...

#52.0% of the time!

Given the margin of error, I'm going to go ahead and round to an even 50%, which is actually incredible. This makes basketball one of the most balanced head to head sports in the world. This is in stark contrast to sports like soccer (sorry non-americans) where the success rate of an offensive possession is tiny because it requires winning several interactions in a row.

**But what about 3 pointers?** Ah yes, to decide how offense compares to defense, we don't need to just define defensive success, but how it compares to offensive success. Unfortunately, that's realistically impossible. Is a made 2 point field goal a successful possession when you could have scored 3? What about a single made free throw? Heck, the total potential point accumulation for a single possession is theoretically infinite due to mechanics like technicals and offensive rebounds from free throw attempts. This conundrum shows that the simple and objective measure of ""did the offense score or not"" fails to actually articulate if a possession was successful or not, teams do things like take lower percentage shots that yield higher point totals on average all the time. The only way to really tell if an offensive possession, and by extension, a defensive possession, is successful is *relatively*. This leads to an interesting problem though, league average offensive and defensive rating are the same number, if we're defining success relatively, then offense and defense will always be of equal value, after all, 1 more point for you has the same net value as 1 less point for the other team, which may sound like the most obvious statement in the world since it's the entire premise of net rating, but it basically means we'll never be able to call one more important than the other.

If you made it through all that, you're probably a nerd like me. I hope it was at least partially interesting. I look forward to the comments, both because I'm sure some of you will find flaws in my reasoning I didn't think of, but also because I find people who believe in the idea offense is inherently more valuable, even on a team level, absolutely hilarious. Next time I plan on tackling the idea *individual* offense is more important than *individual* defense, but that might take a while because that's got a kernal of truth in it.

Hope y'all are staying safe!",0.73,hot,2020-07-23 04:10:21

If you want/can, you can extend the list to more than 5 due to great shooters being left off or #6-10 being very close in ability to the Top 5.",0.7,hot,2020-07-23 05:54:01

I know Lebron also got super high up on a failed Alley oop attempt:

Also note that jumping while dribbling the ball makes it harder and you lose about 2-3 inches on your vert hence why players rarely get their head higher than the rim on dunks. However on Alley oops you can get a lot higher.",0.92,hot,2020-07-22 18:59:27

For the third consecutive year, James Harden leads the league in 3 pointers made.

2017-2018: 265 3PM

2018-2019: 378 3PM

2019-2020: 271 3PM

So if he plays the remaining 8 games, it´s pretty likely that he will finish the regular season with 300 3p FGs for the second year in a row.

Steph Curry though has led the league in 3PM in 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16 and 16-17.

It seems likely that both of them will pass Ray Allen, who is the all time leader in 3 Point Field Goals with 2973. Right now Curry has 2495, Harden 2296.",0.89,hot,2020-07-22 15:56:36

But his final season was botched by the pandemic, where we missed giving him a proper send-off in April, and a celebration of his last game in Toronto. Should he have made his intention to leave the game last year like Dirk and Wade did, seeing how they even got the All Star treatment? It doesn't help that he got overshadowed by Kobe's passing as well (meant no malice with that statement, rest in power to the Mamba).

Which players do you see making a significant improvement during the conclusion of this season?

My pick is **OG Anunoby**, who could've been a breakout defensive star already if he was healthy for 2019's title run. He's shown improvements in his offensive game, and should turn a lot of heads as he gets more TV exposure guarding #1 options in the playoffs.",0.71,hot,2020-07-22 22:15:01

The eye test also shows you how much space Giannis can cover and how he can guard positions 1-5 really well.

He also needs to play offense. I'm not saying that AD plays little offense but I'm saying that Giannis is the main focus on offense and on defense which is pretty tiring. AD has LeBron to take some load off of him on offense and let AD focus on more defense and still, Giannis ranks higher than AD in all of the advanced defensive stats.

I thought it was normal because I also fade off my dominant foot. I play competitively and have a pretty good fadeaway if I say so myself. I just tried fading off my left and I don't really feel a difference. 

Is it bad fundamentals to do so? Or is it just unorthodox because it's more difficult to do? Is it harder to guard? Does it not matter at all?

I practiced the move by myself so it's not like i had anyone teach me the proper foot work. i just make sure not to travel.

There's a greater chance a worse team will be able to perform better relative to the competition (e.g. as many users here are predicting, the Rockets could get hot at the right time and win a ring due to the unique scenario). Despite this, the betting odds look very similar to how they did in the beginning of March when people didn't know the end of the season would be so abnormal. **While I don't think the ordering of odds should be changed, I don't think the Lakers, Bucks, and Clippers should be such heavy favorites**. 

This seems to be common sentiment among this sub and much of the media: it's highly unlikely a team outside of those three wins the championship. What do you think?",0.77,hot,2020-07-22 18:18:47

Rose says he doesnt want to be traded so he wont be leaving. Blake has too big of a contract to be traded right now. He will most likely be tradable in the 2021-22 season, but not right now. I'd love to see a rebuild but it cant happen yet. 

They have a talented roster. They are better than all the awful teams in the east and better than the magic for sure. They're record wasnt only bad bc of blake and rose injuries. They also lost Luke Kennard who was having a great season. Reggie Jackson was also injured and then got traded. Blake also played 100% of his games this year while being injured. Theres no way he plays next season like he played this one. 

They got rid of Drummond so they could have room to resign wood. Christain Wood is better than Drummond at every aspect besides rebounding. He can score better, shoot 3s better and dunk better. He also shows potential on the defensive side of the ball. DR Doom is a work in progress but showed a lot of potential. He averaged more points per game than rookie Giannis. Still only 19. I'm not saying the pistons will win 55 games. That's impossible. But they arent as bad as everyone thinks they are. Could they get 50 wins? Maybe. It's possible. But if everyone gets injured again. But if everyone gets injured again.  Then yeah just tank and lose every game possible. 

The 2020-21 pistons have enough talent to be a decent team. They could surprise some people who have doubts. 40-50 wins is what they'll get. Even though I'd like to see atleast a partial rebuild, it just cant happen right away.",0.35,hot,2020-07-23 11:38:20

202,[OC video analysis] Lakers’ wing Danny Green is an expert at navigating on and off ball screens.

Hey everyone - in this 4.5 min video analysis, I took a deeper look at how Lakers’ wing Danny Green combines physical attributes, mental tools, and specific techniques to expertly navigate on and off ball screens. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:35 On ball screens (fight over & recover, hand speed & timing, gameplay awareness)

\- 1:57 Off ball screens (single handedly foils entire sequences, evading contact + balance, never panics, reading + communication, showing it all off)

\- 4:10 Outro

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

For reference, I’m a DPT and youth basketball coach well-versed in sports science and biomechanics, with sports rehab & performance online consults and clinics in LA. Feel free to hit me with questions.

203,The 2018 Draft was the first since 1984 in which all of the top five picks made the All-Rookie Team the next season,52,hvkyff,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvkyff/the_2018_draft_was_the_first_since_1984_in_which/,18,1595412134.0,"Apologies if this is common knowledge but I thought it was neat fact worth sharing

The 2018 draft was the first draft since 1984 — often considered the greatest draft in NBA history — in which all of the top five picks were selected for the NBA All-Rookie First Team the following season.

2018 Draft:

1. Deandre Ayton
2. Marvin Bagley III
3. Luka Dončić
4. Jaren Jackson Jr.
5. Trae Young

***

1984 Draft:

1. Hakeem Olajuwon
2. Sam Bowie
3. Michael Jordan
4. Sam Perkins
5. Charles Barkley

Perhaps a good omen for the 2018 class moving forward that it can be named alongside the 1984 class? Or perhaps a sign that only three of the top five will end up with Hall of Fame careers?

There were also a couple near-misses with the '91 and '92 draft classes (**bolded** names were voted to the All-Rookie First Team):

1991 Draft:

**1. Larry Johnson**

*2. Kenny Anderson*

**3. Billy Owens**

**4. Dikembe Mutombo**

**5. Steve Smith**

**Stacey Augmon**, drafted #9, rounded out the first team.
***

1992 Draft:

**1. Shaquille O'Neal**

**2. Alonzo Mourning**

**3. Christian Laettner**

*4. Jim Jackson*

**5. Laphonso Ellis**

**6. Tom Gugliotta**

Interestingly, Jim Jackson put up decent numbers in his rookie season and might've had a shot at getting voted to the first team. But he only played the final 28 games of the season due to a contract holdout. In his own words:

> So when I got drafted, and they tried to offer me a deal that was about what the eighth pick got. So Donald Carter came to Columbus in the big plane, and picked me up, and we were flying over Columbus, and he says, ‘Well Jimmy, I don’t think we should pay a guard this much money, because Randy White and Doug Smith didn’t really work out’

> “And I said, ‘Mr. Carter, no disrespect,’ I said, ‘But that’s not my fault that they didn’t work out.’ I said, ‘Now, I’m the fourth pick. I’m not going to ask for anything more, but I’m not going to take less than what my market value is

[Some interesting quotes from him on that holdout.](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2014/01/26/ex-mav-jim-jackson-divulges-details-of-his-1992-holdout-explains-why-three-js-era-never-panned-out/)",0.94,hot,2020-07-22 03:02:14

All four of them are above-average to elite at pretty much every single facet of offensive play. I wonder what it would take to neutralise such a potent offense. Obviously the defensive side of the floor is a whole different ball-game, but it seems like, in trading their two superstars, OKC may have (unintentionally) stumbled onto something unique here, something that feels and has proven to be sustainable over the course of a season.

But how close has anyone come to winning MVP at an even younger age? Here is every player to finish top 5 in MVP voting at a younger age than Rose was his MVP season.

|Player|Season|Age in days|MVP Finish|

|Luka Doncic|2019-20|7,612|?|

I included Luka because I think he'll finish top 5 this season, and if he were to win MVP next season, he'd then be the youngest MVP in history. 

Probably not a huge surprise that KD and LeBron came the closest. KD lost to LeBron in MVP voting by a landslide in 2009-10, so to me the answer here is LeBron in 2005-06. LeBron averaged 31/7/7 that season and the Cavs won 50 games with Ilgauskas being their 2nd best player. Ultimately LeBron lost to Nash in MVP voting, but he's got the best case for a player younger than Rose to have won MVP.",0.88,hot,2020-07-21 16:51:40

I go through my thinking for each team, and give a ranking at the end. Obviously this is all speculation, so feel free to offer your own list.

 Two things:

1. I EXTREMELY stretched the definition of ""star""/""notable"" player for the sake of thoroughness

2. Despite what happened with Porzingus, I don't count people on Rookie contracts because they still have to become restricted free agents and thus have very little leverage (as far as I know, no player worth a max contract has ever taken their qualifying offer to get out of a place sooner)

**Pacific**

**Lakers:**AD could just walk this offseason if he really wanted, really can't see Lebron asking for a trade unless maybe they implode in the playoffs and AD walks (but again, that doesn't seem very likely)

**Clippers:** PG/Kawhi just got there and have player options in 21-22, so it would be more likely they leave than ask for a trade

**Warriors:** Curry seems happy, Klay/Dray just re-signed

**Kings:** Fox is on rookie deal, imo no one else fits the bill

**Suns:** Booker is signed through 23-24, with no player option, so he really doesn't have a lot of leverage 

**Northwest**

**Nuggets:** Jokic is signed through 22-23 and doesn't seem unhappy, Murray begins his 5 year deal next year

**OKC:** Whether CP3 wants out or not is not the issue with trading him lol, SGA is on a rookie deal

**Portland:** Dame/CJ just re-signed and don't seem to be unhappy

**Timberwolves:** Same as Booker, KAT is signed through 23-24 with no player option so he doesn't have a lot of leverage, also they just traded for his buddy D'Lo (who he himself is signed through 22-23)

**Jazz:** The team with the most ""He Gone"" buzz atm. Mitchell is an RFA so unless the team REALLY thinks he will take his QO (which no Max RFA has done before), he doesn't have leverage. However, Gobert has a year left and is in prime position to demand a trade (but there have been rumors, or at least speculation, that the Jazz would want to trade him rather than overpay him anyway)

**Southwest**

**Spurs:** This is assuming DeMar/LMA still count. DeMar has a PO and can walk if he wants. LMA has a year left and it's totally possible he asks for a trade if the team goes in a different direction next year, but he's not exactly a hot commodity at 35 years old and $24 mil

**Mavs:** Zinger just got there/signed, and Cuban is more likely to sell the team than he is to give into a Luka trade demand

**Grizz:** Ja/JJJ are on rookie contracts

**Pels:** BI is an RFA this off-season, and Zion has 0 leverage

**Rockets:** Maybeeee in 1-2 years if this duo isn't successful, but Westbrook/Harden are buddies and probably wouldn't want to break it off after 1 year even if it didn't go well in the playoffs this year. 

**Atlantic**

**Raptors:** Siakam is signed through 23-24, Lowry has 1 more year but they just won the title so he probably stays as long as the team will have him

**Celtics:** Kemba just signed, Brown just got extended, and Tatum is an RFA 

**76ers:** Horford seems unhappy, but he just signed and his contract isn't great so idk if they could even trade him. Harris also just re-signed (and his contract is also not awesome). Simmons is signed through 24-25, and embiid is signed through 22-23 but since there seems to be fit questions about the two together, I could see the team capitulating if one of them do request a trade.

**Nets:** KD/Kyrie just got there, but who knows with Kyrie lol

**Knicks:** RJ is a rookie, and uh, does Mitchell Robinson count?

**Central**

**Bucks:** Giannis is a tough case. The current team is built to his strengths well enough to have won the most games in the regular season two years in a row, and unless this playoffs is a total flame out, he probably will have confidence that next year they will be contenders as well. The only way I see him getting traded instead of walking on his own next year would be him being dead-set on the 5 year supermax for his next team (but everything Giannis has said till now makes it seem like he cares more about winning a championship than getting the absolute most money he possibly can), or there being a team that can offer a great package for him without gutting their team. For those reasons, I think it's more likely he stays one more year rather than request a trade. As for Middleton, his PO isn't until 23-24

**Bulls:** If Lavine counts, he could, but more likely Boylen get fired and Lavine gets to continue to be the man

**Pistons:** They want to trade Griffin lol

**Cavs:** Sexton still on rookie deal, no one wants to give up assets for Love

**Pacers:** Oladipo could request a trade but, with injury issues and one year left, he probably would just want to play out his deal normally to establish his value for the next contract. Sabonis/Turner are both signed for a while, but similar to Embiid/Simmons there are fit issues and the team would probably capitulate if one asked to be traded

**Southeast** 

**Heat:** Bam is RFA, Butler just signed there (and unlike his past two locations, specifically wanted to be here)

**Magic:** Vucci Mane signed til 22/23, Isaac RFA, Gordon is a legit possibility (and yes I'm REALLY stretching the definition of ""notable player"" here)

**Wiz:** Good luck moving Wall, Beal re-signed at the point people previously expected him to say ""get me outta here"" and seems to like being THE guy

**Hawks:** Trae is on rookie deal

**Hornets:** I apologize to Charlotte fans, but even I can't stretch the definitions that far

**Rankings** (based on likelihood, not skill)

1. Gobert

*gap*

2. LMA (If he counts)
3. Lavine (if Boylen isn't fired)
4. Sabonis or Turner
5. Giannis
6. Oladipo
7. Aaron Gordon (if he counts)

With that, the cases are locked, the campaigns are closed, and the voting will begin.

While the media may focus on the MVP award and other prestigious honors, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP. **[The LEAST Valuable Player](https://images.app.goo.gl/jwXWsKEJUk6LQhNc6
)**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2016-17, when aging Indiana SG Monta Ellis won the inaugural trophy and then promptly disappeared from the NBA forever. In 2017-18, Minnesota SG [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/?st=jsdf3cqi&sh=70ff7ca4) won the (dis)honor with some incredibly bad defensive numbers. Last season, New Orleans SF [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won LVP by helping to sink a drowning team and accelerating Anthony Davis' decision to fly the coop.  

Before we announce this year's winner, let's review the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet. 

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. For example, the Wizards would have a hard time competing with John Wall on the sidelines (0 games played, $32M in salary), but we want to focus on players' on-court performance instead.

---

######**dishonorable mentions**

**PG Mike Conley, Utah: 28.6 minutes per game, -0.80 RPM**

We're using Mike Conley to reiterate that the LVP does NOT factor salary into the equation any more than the MVP does. But if it *did*, Mike Conley and his $33M salary may be in trouble. 

It was a disastrous start to the season for Conley. Playing in a new role as a second fiddle to another guard, he could never find his groove. His assists plummeted (down to 4.3 per game), his free-throw attempts cut in half (from 5.8 to 2.9), and he only shot 42.9% from two-point range. That said, he still shot pretty well from 3 (37.6%) and played OK defense, keeping him off our official ballot.

**SF Miles Bridges, Charlotte: 30.7 minutes per game, -2.68 RPM**

Like Mike Conley, Miles Bridges seems like a great guy whom you'd hate to criticize. Alas, that's our exercise here. Caught in between positions, Bridges hasn't been able to figure out his rhythm on offense in the NBA either. He hasn't shot well (33% from three, 48.6% from two) and doesn't get to the line enough (2.0 FTA) to make up for it. The advanced stats get even worse from there (although to be fair, they get dragged down by playing in a bad starting lineup.)

Fortunately for him, Bridges is spared by his youth. At 22, he's technically over our ""21 year old"" threshold, but it still feels unfair to pick on his growing pains as a sophomore. Perhaps in time, he can find a role that can take advantage of his athleticism and talent. But be warned: the clock is ticking. We're taking the kid gloves off soon. Bridges and fellow analytics-allergic Kevin Knox (-7.7 RPM!) will be entering Year 3 next season and will need to step their games up to avoid LVP discussion. 

**SF Kyle Kuzma, L.A. Lakers: 24.6 minutes per game, -0.74 RPM**

Kyle Kuzma can score if need be, but his skill set never made him a natural fit to play third banana to superstars like LeBron James and Anthony Davis. He's not a 3+D player -- he's more of a no-3 (30% this year) no-D player. At the same time, the LVP is about negative impact, and it's hard to find much of consequence here. After all, the Lakers still finished with the # 1 record in the West. Kuzma struggling to find his way is like a tree falling in the woods or a person farting in an empty elevator – ultimately it didn't matter.

**SF Andre Iguodala, Memphis/Miami**

It feels like ancient history now, but this past offseason, the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Andre Iguodala in a trade (under the presumption he may be dealt again.) According to official reports, Iguodala and the Grizzlies MUTUALLY decided that he wouldn't play for Memphis and wouldn't even report to the team in the meantime. Okay. Fine. We'll go along with that.

Still, that situation leaves a sour taste in the LVP headquarters. Memphis turned out to be better than expected, and could have used an extra rotational player. And even if Iguodala wouldn't have helped much on the court, he could have been a valuable mentor for their young kids. That's the least you can expect for a nice $15M in salary. 

---

######**our official top 5 LVP ballot**

**(5) PF Anthony Tolliver (POR, SAC, MEM): 15.6 minutes per game, -3.60 RPM**

I've always had a soft spot for the wise ol' owl, Anthony Tolliver. He's reportedly a great teammate and locker room presence. He also started to develop into an effective stretch four towards the end of this career.

But alas, the end of his career may have snuck up on us sooner than we expected. Tolliver disappointed for Minnesota last season, and completely flopped in his return to Portland. At age 34, he doesn't seem to be a viable rotation player anymore. He didn't play quite enough to merit LVP, but he still played more than he should have.

There's a chance Tolliver comes back next year to serve as a veteran mentor and pseudo-assistant coach somewhere, but it's more likely that he retires. If he does, he'll have played for 10 different franchises in his not-so-illustrious but very respectable career.

**(4) SG Bryn Forbes, San Antonio: 25.1 minutes per game, -0.95 RPM**

The NBA is all about shooting these days, and Bryn Forbes can shoot. He's hit an even 40.0% from three during his NBA career so far, and wasn't too far removed from that this season with 38.8% on 6.0 attempts per game. As a result, his true shooting percentage (57%) was above average. The Spurs lacked spacers, and Forbes fit that bill.

So what's the problem...? Turns out, basketball is more than a halfcourt game. And whenever the ball crosses that pesky midcourt line, Bryn Forbes starts to become a liability. 

At only 6'3"", Forbes is undersized to play the SG position, which is where the Spurs played him 74% of the time (according to basketball-reference.) Partly due to those athletic limitations, he only registered 0.5 steals per game, and blocked a grand total of 0 shots in his 1579 minutes of action. The advanced stats get ugly; Forbes ranks near the bottom at his position in DRPM, DBPM, all the alphabet formulas that you can cook up.

At the end of the day, LVP is about negative impact, and there's plenty here. Forbes is not a bad player in a vacuum, but he did not help the Spurs this year. In fact, their undersized lineup is a big reason why they're struggling so much on defense (25th in the NBA). As a direct result, they're on track to miss the playoffs for the first time in decades. 

**(3) SF Mario Hezonja, Portland: 16.3 minutes per game, -2.79 RPM**

During the entire run of the Damian Lillard - C.J. McCollum era, Portland has struggled to figure out their wing rotation. That would be tested even more this season, with familiar faces like Moe Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, and Evan Turner slipping out the door.
The trials and tribulations kept coming like Damian Lillard was Job, as injuries ravaged the Blazers' new depth chart. The team didn't need a star to emerge at forward -- but they needed [*somebody.* Anybody.](https://images.app.goo.gl/yzu1jBoNpAY3DiGC6)

In theory, that player should have been Mario Hezonja, a former lottery pick and a live body with good athleticism and size at 6'8"". Signed this summer for a modest price ($1.7M), Hezonja had the chance to jumpstart his NBA career with a major opportunity on the team. Instead, he flopped like Marcus Smart taking a phantom elbow.

Hezonja's biggest problem is that, at age 25, he still hasn't found his feel on the court. He's not a good shooter (32.8% from three), and doesn't use his athleticism to find his way to the line (1.1 attempts per game.) He was a non-factor (5 PPG, 3 RPG) on a team that desperately needed him to step up. In fact, the Blazers were so desperate for help that they not only signed Carmelo Anthony, but they played him over 32 minutes a game.

Again, we see a real ""LVP"" candidacy here with a direct effect on the standings. The Blazers' getting a big fat nothing from Hezonja was a major part of their struggle to get to .500 this season.

**(2) C Dewayne Dedmon, SAC/ATL: 17.6 minutes per game, -2.51 RPM**

We're not supposed to factor in salaries into this equation, but Dewayne Dedmon's situation merits a mention for context. The Sacramento Kings signed the big man to a head-scratching 3-year, $40M deal this summer (seriously.) Clearly, GM Vlade Divac thought his young Kings were only a few veterans away from making the playoffs, bringing in (and over-paying) Dedmon, Cory Joseph, and Trevor Ariza.

Among the three, Dedmon turned out to be the most disappointing for several reasons. He didn't play well to start the season, and got usurped in the rotation by underrated Richaun Holmes. Rather than suck it up, take a deep breath, and take a relaxing dive in his new Scrooge McDuck money pool, Dedmon started to whine and complain and push for a trade. For a team that was struggling, Dedmon's headache became the *last* thing they needed. Ultimately, they ditched him back to where he came from in Atlanta.

Now, being difficult and being a prima donna isn't enough to get you LVP honors. You have to stink on the court as well. And sure enough, Dedmon started to check those boxes. Billed as a stretch five after hitting some threes in Atlanta, Dedmon lost his shot in the SMF airport baggage claim. He shot only 19.7% from three for the Kings, registering a 47.3% true shooting percentage on the season. His defense is OK, but it's not good enough make up for his poor offensive play. He's not bad *enough* to get LVP, but he hurt his team this year.

**(1) PG Isaiah Thomas, Washington: 23.1 minutes per game, -2.75 RPM**

We've awarded three LVP trophies in the past, and a familiar pattern is starting to emerge. The most dangerous players aren't necessarily the *bad* players; they're the players who used to be *good.* Because of their prior success, they tend to get overplayed by their coaches and drag their teams down with them.

It wasn't too long ago that Isaiah Thomas found himself in the MVP conversation for the Boston Celtics, as his incredible shotmaking helped make up for any defensive limitations he may have as a 5'9"" player. That said, a small player like Thomas is always going to have a thin margin for error to remain a winning player. He needs to be GREAT offensively to make up for his defense. Unfortunately, his offense has not been great since his infamous injury. He can still make shots (hitting 41.3% of his threes), but he's not getting inside the paint and not getting to the free-throw line (1.9 attempts per game.) As a result, his true-shooting percentage lagged to 53.1%, well below league average.

If Isaiah Thomas isn't making scoring efficiently, then what is he doing to help a team win? He's not a great distributor (3.7 assists per game.) He's a very poor rebounder (1.7 per game.) And yes, that defense is still a major problem. According to ESPN's RPM metric, Thomas graded as a -4.2 impact per 100 possessions, the second worst in the league at PG after Trae Young. Basketball-reference lists his ""defensive rating"" at 121. For comparison's sake, the worst team defense in the league still held teams under 116. (That worst team? The Wizards.)

You can make an argument that there's still a place for Thomas in the NBA as a sparkplug scorer off the bench. Alas, that's not how the Wizards had been using him this season. He started 37 of 40 games for the team. Largely as a result of that, the Wizards' starting lineup was atrocious defensively. Fellow starters like Bradley Beal and Rui Hachimura ranked toward the bottom of their position in defensive metrics as well. When your lineup stinks defensively, a good coach may look in the mirror and say: hey, maybe we need a change here. Sadly, quick reactions are not Scottie Brooks' strong suit. He has the type of sloth-like speed that even frustrate workers at the DMV. The Wizards *eventually* dumped IT, but it took far too long to make that shift.

To be fair, the Wizards' options at point guard were limited with John Wall injured. Veteran Ish Smith is mediocre right now, and Shabazz Napier arrived late in the season. Still, the point here is: almost *any* competent point guard (like a Napier) would have helped the Wizards more than Isaiah Thomas. He had become a negative for them. The cold hard truth is that: it's very difficult to win basketball games with Thomas starting. And given that, he is our official **LVP.**",0.96,hot,2020-07-20 14:06:37

In middle school while Shaq was playing for the Sun's I went trick or treating with my friend from Boy's and Girl's club basketball who lived in his neighborhood. Shaq gave out king sized candy bars because he wouldn't have been able to open the fun sized candy bars people normally gave out.

256,"Relegation system in the NBA, I don't think it would be good for now",8,hvaj6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvaj6j/relegation_system_in_the_nba_i_dont_think_it/,23,1595377756.0,"After watching a lot of premier league soccer in quarantine I done some thinking on what if NBA implemented relegation.

In the NBA there's a problem with only half of the league being competitive and the other half don't really care about that season and are only focused on snagging a star through the draft or free agency. The draft promotes complacency, bad teams are okay with being bad because they'll get good players because of it. And the top 4 teams are leveraging everything they have to win it this year because their window might be closing. 

I think what relegation systems are useful for is increasing the level of play because it forces even the worst teams to be competitive and fight in every game. Relegation would really be beneficial in the MLS because the league is so much weaker than other international leagues. But the NBA is by far the best league in the world and if you put the worst team in the NBA in Euroleague it would probably win. And the best players not in the NBA would not score more than 10 points a game (I know Luke exists he was just too young to play in the NBA)

Right now relegation doesn't make sense and would probably destroy the NCAA, but until other countries leagues can seriously compete with the NBA the complacency in the bottom half of the NBA will persist",0.84,hot,2020-07-21 17:29:16

As you can see from my roster selection, I'm going for the classic ""Surround your athletic superstar with all the shooters and great defenders."" approach, with most of those shooters being capable of creating for themselves.

Yes, the Center position is pretty weak except for Bam, but they're mostly around for rebounding purposes.

They'd also play much faster then the other teams of the era, rules withstanding or not

I got pretty bored of the whole ""This megateam against this other megateam."" thing that goes on sometimes and this is a nice excercise for me in regards to making team great without making them stupid great.",0.46,hot,2020-07-22 10:32:56

Big 3 of Dame/Zion/Jaylen Brown. Imagine Dame being able to feed Zion.

Theme this time around was power forwards who excel in the paint so I paired them with stretch 5's. Also surrounding them with solid 3&D players. Paschall as a Zion-lite sixth man seems intriguing. 

The bench concerns me, but I wanted to highlight some teams I usually don't include (Spurs, Suns, GSW)

Carter was then traded to the Magic the year after they lost in the finals and made the conference finals. Then, after a brief and uninspiring stint with the Suns, he signed with the Mavs after they won a title.

From my perspective, it feels like Vince has struggled to add winning value to most teams he’s been a part of. He hasn’t been a bad player, but at some point, the results show mediocre success.",0.36,hot,2020-07-22 13:53:08
263,[Opinion] The Sixth Man of the Year is a ridiculous concept for an award and shouldn't exist.,233,husgja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/husgja/opinion_the_sixth_man_of_the_year_is_a_ridiculous/,110,1595303842.0,"This is inspired by the post that said Dennis Schröder is averaging more minutes than Giannis this year. 

No other sport has an equivalent award and it's close to meaningless. It just means the best player that doesn't start, which is already a pretty arbitrary distinction depending on your team makeup. The most prominent examples of how arbitrary that can be are Harden in 2011-12 and Ginobli 07-08. Both of those guys would have started in just about any other team in the league but their team makeup made it beneficial for them to come off the bench. Then, they always closed games for their team. With the exception of Jamal Crawford in 2013-14, every 6MOTY has been top 5 in minutes on their team dating back to 2005. 

Even if we took that arbitrary distinction out of the picture, what does the 6MOTY mean? The 151st best player in the NBA? I don't think the award means anything and always goes to the starting-caliber player that *happens* to come off the bench.  Obviously it doesn't hurt anybody to give an extra player another award but I don't find it interesting or important at all.",0.76,hot,2020-07-20 20:57:22
