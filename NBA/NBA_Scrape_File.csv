The Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Orlando Magic, 99-90, on Wednesday afternoon in the opening scrimmage of the NBA restart in Orlando.
 
The squads broke ice on the NBA’s four-month-plus shutdown with both teams playing the majority of their regulars in the 40-minute scrimmage. Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic were among those who had a solid workload.
 
Lou Williams scored a game-high 22 points, while George had 18 points and five rebounds as the Clippers turned in a dominant 32-16 advantage in the second quarter. The Magic chipped six points off their 11-point halftime deficit in the third quarter, but Los Angeles outpaced them by four points in the fourth to secure the win.
 
Leonard, Reggie Jackson and Marcus Morris each had nine points for the Clippers. Joakim Noah started at center with both Ivica Zubac and Montrezl Harrell away from Orlando and totaled four points, five rebounds and three assists.
 
Vucevic led the way for the Magic with 18 points on 61.5 percent shooting from the field, adding 10 rebounds and three assists. Michael Carter-Williams followed with a bench-leading 16 points, and Terrence Ross scored 14 points. Gordon posted 13 points, seven boards, three assists and one block. The starting backcourt of D.J.

The Nuggets, who blocked seven shots and out-rebounded the Wizards, 47-34, were led by Troy Daniels' 22 points, six rebounds and three assists.

Houston Rockets guard Russell Westbrook returned to the floor on Wednesday after being away from the team due to a positive test for COVID-19.
Westbrook arrived in Orlando on Monday after quarantining for two weeks. Once he arrived in Orlando, he quarantined in his hotel room until he cleared the NBA's protocol to enter the campus.

Westbrook told the media on Wednesday he experienced no COVID-19 symptoms beyond a stuffy nose. He is unsure how long it will take him to return to game shape.
“First of all, I’m just thankful and blessed to be able to go out and compete again,” Westbrook said. “But, just quarantining at home, trying to be productive, obviously not able to get on the basketball floor, but finding ways to kind of stay active and do as much conditioning I can probably do as far as that.
“That’s the last think I worry about, honestly. Before I had to quarantine, I was in pretty good shape so I should be all right.”
Coach Mike D'Antoni said Westbrook probably won't be available for Friday's scrimmage against the Toronto Raptors. Westbrook was expected to go through about 80% of Wednesday's practice.

“We’ll wait the next two practices, see where he is,"" D'Antoni said. ""Whether he wants to be thrown out there real quick or wants another couple of days. Whatever he wants is cool. He knows his body. We’re not talking about a normal athlete. We’re talking about a super athlete.”
“I have to see if I can make a layup at this point,” Westbrook said. “I got to start there and work my way from there.”
The final player yet to arrive for the Rockets is recently signed forward Luc Mbah a Moute. According to D'Antoni, Mbah a Moute has been cleared to travel and could arrive in Orlando on Wednesday.

            Zion Williamson had to leave the NBA campus for an urgent family matter on July 16.
          
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Zion Williamson could still make re-opening night of the NBA season.
The New Orleans Pelicans said Wednesday that Williamson, who left the NBA bubble at Walt Disney World last week, is being tested daily for the coronavirus and continues showing negative results. If that continues, Williamson may have to quarantine for only four days when he returns to the team.
And if that return comes in the next few days, that means he could still have a shot of playing when New Orleans faces Utah on July 30 in the first of the 88 seeding games at Disney.

“While there is no current timetable for his return to campus, he fully intends to rejoin the team,” the Pelicans said in a statement. “Per NBA protocol, his quarantine period will be determined upon his return.”
The minimum quarantine Williamson would have to serve for leaving, even though he was officially excused, is the four-day option.
The rookie left the team to tend to “an urgent family matter,” the Pelicans said.
The former Duke star has played in 19 games this season, averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. He also missed the actual opening night of the season, when New Orleans played the first game of this 2019-20 campaign in Toronto against the reigning NBA champion Raptors.

"To NBA coaches, racial equality is a priority of the restart",By Tim Reynolds | The Associated Press ,"Jul 22, 2020 4:43 PM ET","

            Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce is using his platform to create change.
          
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Dallas’ Rick Carlisle now starts every interview session by reading from a calendar that highlights something that happened on that day in the country’s racial history. Toronto’s Nick Nurse is often wearing shirts to practice proclaiming that Black Lives Matter. Orlando’s Steve Clifford, in lieu of pre-practice film, showed his team a documentary on the life of John Lewis.
While NBA players are using the season restart to demand change, coaches in the league are not making them walk down that path alone.
Coaches around the NBA -- where most players are Black and most coaches are white -- have been active participants in the demand societal change around the league. The demands became a flashpoint when George Floyd, a handcuffed Black man, died when a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes.
“I think it’s just understanding the moment and the movement that is taking place,” Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. “That’s what all our coaches are doing, and as white coaches, they’re no fools. I think the beauty of our game is, we coach African American men, myself and the white coaches. We’re around it. We know our league is predominantly African American. So why not? If we’re going to ask for others to be empathetic, I think we all have to be empathetic.”
Pierce isn’t at the NBA restart at Walt Disney World -- the Hawks aren’t among the 22 teams still playing this season -- but he’s been active on regular leaguewide coaches Zoom calls and leads a committee of coaches tasked with how those in the NBA can best aid the societal-change movement.
He also helped get someone to coach the coaches.
Bryan Stevenson is the founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, an NBA community partner, and is someone who has spent 30 years pushing for social justice. He was scheduled to meet with the NBA’s coaches over a Zoom call for a half-hour a few weeks ago. The call went more than three times that long, and from there a running dialogue was born.
“It was mesmerizing,” Carlisle said of that initial call. “It was an education in itself.”
It’s the calendar created by Stevenson’s organization that Carlisle reads from each day. The impact by whatever Stevenson said to coaches that first night has continued resonating.
“You have to believe things you haven’t seen,” Stevenson said. “You have to have hope that we can turn this moment into something more than a moment. I mean, hopelessness is the enemy of justice and injustice prevails where hopelessness persists. And if NBA coaches believe that and if NBA players believe that, then fans can believe it too.”
He’s convinced the coaches believe.
Stevenson has been lauded publicly by virtually all the league’s coaches in recent weeks for helping educate them on things that they never knew. In a league where a handful of coaches -- Golden State’s Steve Kerr and San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich, most notably -- are not shy about sharing political views publicly, this moment has driven other coaches to use their voices as well.
The NBA got permission to make the “John Lewis: Good Trouble” documentary available to all head and assistant coaches this week and several teams -- including the Magic, at Clifford’s request -- screened the film. It was also available as a featured movie on the curated channel within the hotels.
“I’m inspired by how this movement still has great stamina, and I think our ability to go there and still keep the conversation alive with our platforms is important,” Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. “The next step that everybody wants to see is action and lasting, sustainable change in areas of systemic racism and social inequalities.”
Players are at Disney to compete for a championship, though the broader societal issues have not diminished since they arrived. Denver’s Jerami Grant took five questions in an interview last week and all his answers, no matter the topic, revolved around a demand for arrests in the killing of Breonna Taylor. Philadelphia’s Tobias Harris took a similar tactic a few days later. Houston’s Russell Westbrook has a clothing line that will display social-justice messaging and most players will wear jerseys with similar thoughts printed on the back as well.
If the players take an action on the court during games, such as kneeling, a person with knowledge of the situation said coaches have agreed to do the same. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no plans have been announced.
“It’s a seminal moment, in the sense that we have an opportunity to do something transformative if we have the courage,” Popovich said. “And as with many things in today’s world, interest wanes pretty quickly no matter what the topic. ... So, the league, the players, the coaches, staff, everybody is very committed to keeping it up-front in everybody’s consciousness, even though everybody’s excited to go play. This is a great opportunity.”
At Disney the NBA will where the phrase “Black Lives Matter” is painted on the courts for games. Stevenson believes coaches can have that same impact.
The way NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sees it, fans will take their cues from watching their various favorite teams -- players and coaches alike. If the NBA is speaking change into existence and acting accordingly, he believes fans will apply that same passion to whatever role they can play into the movement.
“We can use that same desire and hope for racial equality and an end to police violence and justice for communities that have been undermined by unhealthy unsafe practices and policies,” Stevenson said. “That’s a really powerful thing to imagine. And so, if we can achieve that, yes, I absolutely believe that can be a transformative moment.”

LA Clippers guard Patrick Beverley left the NBA campus on Tuesday for an emergency personal matter, according to multiple reports.
Beverley is expected to rejoin the team in the future, and he'll need to follow the NBA's Health and Safety re-entry protocol when that time comes.
If a player leaves campus for extenuating circumstances, he will be required to quarantine for 4-10 days upon his return. The period will be four days if the player who left campus produces negative tests for at least seven days prior to his return.
In other words, Beverley will need to pass a coronavirus test every day he is off-campus in order to have a four-day quarantine inside the Disney hotel instead of 10.
The Clippers will play their first exhibition game against the Orlando Magic on Wednesday. They will be without Beverley and forward Montrezl Harrell, who left Orlando last week for an emergency family matter.

LA will play its first seeding game on July 30 against the L.A. Lakers.

"Zion Williamson returns to NBA campus, begins quarantine","Jul 24, 2020 8:09 PM ET",null,"

            Zion Williamson left the NBA campus last week for an unspecified family emergency.
          
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Zion Williamson will be out of quarantine by the time New Orleans plays in the first official game of the NBA restart at Walt Disney World.
Whether the Pelicans will play him that night or not remains anyone’s guess.
The NBA said Saturday that Williamson will have to serve a four-day quarantine for leaving the league’s Disney bubble on July 16 to tend to an urgent family matter. He returned to Disney on Friday night and immediately went into quarantine.
That means he will likely be released from quarantine sometime Tuesday, two days before the Pelicans play the first “seeding game” against the Utah Jazz.
A person familiar with the situation said that if all goes well with Williamson’s quarantine, he can return to team activities during a practice scheduled for Tuesday night. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because such plans have not been completed and cannot be until Williamson passes more tests now that he has returned to Disney.
“The most important thing is we hope everything’s OK with him,” Pelicans forward Derrick Favors said Saturday, shortly after the NBA revealed the four-day quarantine determination. “He went away for personal reasons. So, it’s good to see. Whatever it was, hope everything went fine and OK and he’s back with us. And I know everybody’s excited to have him back. I know he’s excited to be back.”
Williamson was tested daily during his absence and continually came back negative for COVID-19, which helped his hopes for a shorter quarantine upon his return to Disney. The league has said quarantine for those who leave the bubble can last as much as 10 days or more if those individuals are not tested daily while they are away.
The No. 1 overall pick in last year’s NBA draft is averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds in 19 games this season for the Pelicans, who are one of six teams in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.

All 22 teams participating in the NBA Restart will play three scrimmages before game action officially tips off on July 30. The NBA will be using 10-minute quarters instead of the usual 12 minutes for each team's first game. The second and third games for each team will feature regulation quarters of 12 minutes. 
Previous Roundups: July 23 | July 22
Below are game recaps from all games played on July 24:

* * *
The Philadelphia 76ers leveraged a dominant first half and a double-double from Tobias Harris for a 90-83 win over the Memphis Grizzlies in an NBA restart scrimmage in Orlando on Friday afternoon.
The 76ers (39-26 current regular-season record) jumped out to a 25-12 advantage through the first 10 minutes and had added another 14 points to their edge by intermission. The Grizzlies (32-33 current regular-season record) trailed by as many as 29 points at one juncture, but they managed to chip 16 points off their 27-point halftime deficit during the third quarter before the comeback fell short in the final period. The biggest disparity on the stat sheet came in free-throw shooting, where Philadelphia’s 83.3% success rate dwarfed Memphis’ 56.2% figure.
Harris paced the Sixers with 15 points and 10 rebounds, adding two assists, one steal and one block. Joel Embiid followed with 10 points, six boards and one assist. Ben Simmons stuffed the stat sheet with nine points, nine assists, seven rebounds and three steals. Josh Richardson and Shake Milton contributed matching six-point tallies. Al Horford posted five points, five assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block in 18 minutes off the bench.
Jonas Valanciunas led the Grizzlies with a 20-point, 11-rebound double-double that also included two assists, one steal and one block. Kyle Anderson contributed 14 points and eight boards, while Jaren Jackson Jr. supplied 13 points, three rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. Ja Morant shot just 3-for-12 on his way to seven points, but he added eight assists and five boards. Brandon Clarke and De’Anthony Melton registered 11 and 10 points off the bench, respectively.
Both teams return to the floor Sunday, with the Sixers facing the Oklahoma City Thunder to kick off the day’s ledger and the Grizzlies tangling with the Houston Rockets in the final contest of the night.

Serge Ibaka scored 18 points to lead the Toronto Raptors to a 94-83 victory against the Houston Rockets in a NBA Season Restart Scrimmage in Orlando.
The Rockets led, 75-72, with 9:18 to play in the fourth quarter, but the Raptors went on a 22-4 run over the next six and half minutes to take control.
Ibaka took advantage of his extended action with Marc Gasol (rest) not playing. He shot 8-of-10 from the field, including 2-of-3 from 3-point range, and had three rebounds. Ibaka and Pascal Siakam (13 points, five rebounds) controlled the paint against Houston’s small-ball scheme, as Toronto out-rebounded Houston, 43-38.

Jul 27, 2020 1:32 AM ET

            Clippers guard Patrick Beverley has not participated in practice since last Tuesday.
          
Five days after he left the NBA campus for a family emergency, Patrick Beverley rejoined the LA Clippers on Sunday, reports ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
Clippers guard Patrick Beverley has returned to the Orlando bubble after leaving for a family emergency on Tuesday, sources tell ESPN.
It remains to be seen whether Beverley will clear quarantine before the Clippers’ first seeding game on Thursday night against the Los Angeles Lakers.
If a player leaves campus for extenuating circumstances, he will be required to quarantine for 4-10 days upon his return. The period will be four days if the player who left campus produces negative tests for at least seven days prior to his return.
A lockdown defender, Beverley is averaging 7.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.7 assists over 48 games this season.

All 22 teams participating in the NBA Restart will play three scrimmages before game action officially tips off on July 30.

Andre Roberson hit two 3-pointers with less than a minute to play to rally the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 102-97 victory against the Philadelphia 76ers in an NBA restart scrimmage at Orlando on Sunday.
The Thunder trailed by as many as 24 in the third quarter and were down 86-72 with 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter before waking up. Oklahoma City went on an 8-0 run to tie the game at 92 with 3:20 remaining and took its first lead since the opening quarter with less than a minute remaining when Roberson drilled his first 3-pointer for a 98-97 lead. A few moments later, Roberson sank another trey to ice the game with 12.9 seconds to go. Those were his only points of the game.
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the way for the Thunder with 16 points, seven rebounds, two steals and five assists, while Steven Adams totaled 11 points and nine rebounds. Luguentz Dort chipped in with 13 points in a surprise start at shooting guard.
The 76ers were without Joel Embiid, who injured his right calf Friday, but Ben Simmons flirted with a triple-double, finishing with 14 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Al Horford had 13 points, nine boards and three assists, while Josh Richardson (10 points, four steals, three assists, two rebounds and two blocks) and Shake Milton (11 points, four boards, two assists) formed a productive backcourt tandem.
Both teams will play Tuesday. The Thunder face the Portland Trail Blazers, while the Sixers square off against the Dallas Mavericks.

The Boston Celtics gained some key separation in the third quarter after a back-and-forth first half to notch a 117-103 victory over the Phoenix Suns in an NBA restart scrimmage in Orlando on Sunday afternoon.
The Celtics (43-21 regular-season record) were outplayed on both ends of the floor over the first 12 minutes by the Suns (26-39 regular-season record), who rang up 32 points while limiting Boston to 29. However, coach Brad Stevens’ squad turned the game around during the middle periods, when they outscored Phoenix by a 65-49 margin. The expansion of a four-point halftime advantage to 13 points by the end of the third quarter gave the Celtics the breathing room they needed to notch the double-digit win, one in which they outshot their opponent by a 48.8 percent-38.9 percent margin.
Devin Booker led the way for the Suns with 17 points, adding nine assists and four rebounds. Mikal Bridges followed with 16 points and also furnished five boards and three blocks. Cameron Johnson supplied 13 points, while Dario Saric turned in 12 points and eight boards. Deandre Ayton registered 11 points, seven rebounds and two steals. Ricky Rubio made his scrimmage debut and totaled six points, four assists and two rebounds.
Jaylen Brown paced the Celtics with a game-high 21 points on 7-for-13 shooting, including a 3-for-6 tally from 3-point range. Gordon Hayward delivered 17 points, six boards and three assists. Jayson Tatum finished with 16 points and nine rebounds, while Marcus Smart led the second unit with 10 points, five rebounds and five assists. Kemba Walker, who’s been battling knee soreness, was able to log nine minutes of action and record six points.
Both teams return to the floor Tuesday for their final scrimmages, with the Suns battling the Toronto Raptors in a matinee affair and the Celtics facing the Houston Rockets in the evening.

Reports: Tom Thibodeau finalizing 5-year deal to become Knicks head coach,"Jul 25, 2020 1:58 PM ET",null,"

            Tom Thibodeau would take over for interim coach Mike Miller.
          
NEW YORK (AP) -- Tom Thibodeau is coming back to the New York Knicks, who are still seeking the success they enjoyed when he was an assistant two decades ago.
The Knicks are finishing a deal to make Thibodeau their coach, a person with knowledge of the details said Saturday.
No contract has been signed but a deal is expected to be announced next week, the person told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because negotiations were ongoing.
ESPN first reported that the Knicks and Thibodeau were completing a five-year contract.
When they do, the 2011 NBA Coach of the Year in Chicago will become the 13th different person to coach the Knicks since Jeff Van Gundy resigned early in the 2001-02 season.
Orlando Magic coach Steve Clifford was told during his team’s scrimmage at Walt Disney World against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday that Thibodeau, his longtime friend and confidant, was going to get the New York job.
“Look, he’s one of my closest friends,” Clifford said. “He’s one of the best coaches in the league and he understands New York. He was in New York for a long time. New York is a different animal. He understands the fan base. He understands the New York media and he’s a great, great coach. So, he’ll do great there and it’s a great hire on their part.”
Thibodeau was an assistant under Van Gundy, who led the Knicks to the 1999 NBA Finals and into the postseason in every season he was there. New York has reached the playoffs just three times since Van Gundy’s departure.
The Knicks went 21-45 this season, missing the playoffs for a seventh straight year. Mike Miller finished the season as interim coach after David Fizdale was fired 22 games into the season.
New Knicks President Leon Rose then interviewed a number of candidates before choosing Thibodeau from a field that included Jason Kidd, former Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson and Miller, who impressed Rose while going 17-27 before the season was suspended in March.
San Antonio assistants Will Hardy and Ime Udoka were also candidates. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said both will get their opportunities but praised the choice of Thibodeau.
“Tommy’s a seasoned veteran who it goes without saying understands what wins and what loses. He knows how to put a program together, create a culture and be demanding — and at the same time, make people accountable,” Popovich said.
“It’s easy to demand things, but to make people accountable and want to play the right way is not something that’s easy for everybody to do. But Tom knows it inside and out and he’ll be a great choice to organize the situation there, develop a plan, start the culture, stick to it, be persistent and get after it. So it’s a great choice.”
Thibodeau is regarded as a demanding coach who is one of the top defensive minds in the game. He devised the defense that carried the Boston Celtics to the 2008 NBA championship as an assistant before becoming Chicago’s coach in 2010.
He guided the Bulls to a 62-20 record as a rookie coach, the first of five straight postseason berths even as the team battled constant injuries to star guard Derrick Rose and others.
Overall, he is 352-246 as a head coach. He led the Minnesota Timberwolves to the postseason in 2018 but was fired the next year during a rocky season that began with star Jimmy Butler asking to be traded.
Players around the league took notice of the pending move as well.
Heat forward Jae Crowder retweeted a clip from a 2018 game Saturday, one where he was playing for Utah and Thibodeau was coaching the Timberwolves. Crowder and Thibodeau got involved in a very heated war of words during the game that night, earning them both technical fouls.
“CONGRATS TIBS ON THE NEW COACHING JOB. CANT WAIT TO HAVE THESE BATTLES WITH YOU AGAIN.!,” Crowder tweeted Saturday.

"Zion Williamson returns to NBA campus, begins quarantine","Jul 24, 2020 8:09 PM ET",null,"

            Zion Williamson left the NBA campus last week for an unspecified family emergency.
          
LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Zion Williamson will be out of quarantine by the time New Orleans plays in the first official game of the NBA restart at Walt Disney World.
Whether the Pelicans will play him that night or not remains anyone’s guess.
The NBA said Saturday that Williamson will have to serve a four-day quarantine for leaving the league’s Disney bubble on July 16 to tend to an urgent family matter. He returned to Disney on Friday night and immediately went into quarantine.
That means he will likely be released from quarantine sometime Tuesday, two days before the Pelicans play the first “seeding game” against the Utah Jazz.
A person familiar with the situation said that if all goes well with Williamson’s quarantine, he can return to team activities during a practice scheduled for Tuesday night. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because such plans have not been completed and cannot be until Williamson passes more tests now that he has returned to Disney.
“The most important thing is we hope everything’s OK with him,” Pelicans forward Derrick Favors said Saturday, shortly after the NBA revealed the four-day quarantine determination. “He went away for personal reasons. So, it’s good to see. Whatever it was, hope everything went fine and OK and he’s back with us. And I know everybody’s excited to have him back. I know he’s excited to be back.”
Williamson was tested daily during his absence and continually came back negative for COVID-19, which helped his hopes for a shorter quarantine upon his return to Disney. The league has said quarantine for those who leave the bubble can last as much as 10 days or more if those individuals are not tested daily while they are away.
The No. 1 overall pick in last year’s NBA draft is averaging 23.6 points and 6.8 rebounds in 19 games this season for the Pelicans, who are one of six teams in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
