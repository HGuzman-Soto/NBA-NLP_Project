0,"With a world title and an Olympic silver medal of their own already, Meryl Davis and Charlie White were quite happy to share this latest accomplishment. Davis and White won their fifth consecutive ice dance crown at the US Figure Skating Championships on Saturday, matching a record held by four other couples. As the audience stood and cheered, Davis knelt close to the ice for several seconds, her head bowed. ''Being in such an elite group of American ice dancers from the past and seeing that we belong with them, it's special,'' White said. ''All the hard work and our families and their dedication, our support group — you need a lot of things to come together to make that happen, including staying healthy. There are a lot of little things. I'm proud of us for being able to stick with it, and our continuing love for the sport has helped a lot. ''I'm pleased and I couldn't be more proud.'' Judy Schwomeyer and James Sladky (1968-72); Judy Blumberg and Michael Seibert (1981-85); Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev (1999-2003); and Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto (2004-2008) also won five titles. The Olympic silver medalists and 2011 world champions had had such a big lead after the short dance they had to do little more but step on the ice to win. But they did so much more than that with their dramatic and powerful routine to ''Notre Dame de Paris,'' setting personal bests for both overall score (197.44 points) and free dance (118.42). They finished more than 20 points ahead — yes, you read that right — of Madison Chock and Evan Bates (175.91). Maia and Alex Shibutani were docked a point for an extended lift and finished third (174.21). Earlier Saturday, Marissa Castelli and Simon Shnapir overcame a big mistake to win their first pairs title. ''Coming to the US Championships is a good time and there's always a positive energy,'' Davis said. ''It's such an honor to come here. I think being able to perform really well pushes us to put out a better performance, and we are honored to get the results that we did.'' For generations, Americans weren't even an afterthought in ice dance. They were so far below the world powerhouses it's a good bet the Russians and British didn't even know their names. But that has changed in the last 10 years, and Davis and White now set the standard in the sport. Their rivalry with Canada's Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir is the best thing going, with the training partners playing a game of ''Can you top this?'' Virtue and Moir edged the Americans at the Vancouver Olympics, as well as at the 2010 and 2012 world championships. The Americans won the world title in 2011, as well as the last four Grand Prix finals. Though they have no peers in the United States, that doesn't mean they coast when they come to nationals. Far from it. ''That energy only pushes us and makes us feel even more excited,'' Davis said. Their performance was spellbinding, so intense no one in the arena dared breathe. Every inch of the ice, every nuance of music was filled with intricate and elegant moves, one more difficult than the next. Their skating skills have always been superb, their edge quality so fine that coaches pop in DVDs of them to show their students. But it is the way they combine the athletic strengths with the beauty and elegance of a dance that makes them so breathtaking. They are a sporting event and a theater show rolled into one. Their lifts can barely be described they were so intricate and innovative. In one, White twirled Davis like a rifle and whipped her from his front to back all while skating and turning at full speed. They oozed emotion, using the tips of their eyelashes all the way down to the toes of their feet to express the character of the dance, and the audience was as exhausted as Davis and White when they finished. Chock and Bates and the Shibutanis have the misfortune of trying to compete with that, and there was no way they could come close. At least, not now. Chock and Bates' lifts are filled with unique positions, and they were done with great speed and control. But it was the love story they displayed to ''Dr. Zhivago'' that was so delightful. Close your eyes, and you could almost see the horses and the sleigh in the falling snow. ''It's been such a great season,'' Chock said. ''We have been working very hard, and we hope to keep getting better and better from here.'' The Shibutanis' routine to ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' was seamless, the elements flowing from one to the other so perfectly it was impossible to tell where one ended and the next began. The siblings opened with a pairs spin that was better than anything seen during the actual pairs competition earlier in the afternoon, and it lasted for what seemed like forever - no easy feat to maintain that speed and momentum. Their twizzles — traveling spins — are, simply, exquisite. They are done in perfect unison, right down to the raising of their arms while they spin. Their big flaw was that he held his sister too long on a lift, a mistake they also made in the short dance.",Raw Data

The visitors put the game beyond doubt in the 72nd when Mandzukic crossed for Thomas Mueller to finish off a counterattack in the 72nd. Mueller earlier had a goal ruled out for offside. Bayern's 15th win from 19 games leaves it 11 points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, which was held to a 0-0 draw at Freiburg on Saturday. Defending champion Borussia Dortmund is third, a point further back.",Raw Data

These guys are just throwing down and Mousasi grabs a double, can’t quite finish it. Kyle against the cage as Mousasi can’t finish, gives it up and back to standing. Kyle’s striking looks really crisp tonight. He’s landing solid strikes as he’s looking to counter; Mousasi is stalking him down but isn’t looking to trade.

Cormier grabs the clinch and drags him to the ground. Cormier in mount giving him a bit of a beating right now; Cormier is just out-classing him right now. Round ends as Cormier tees off on him from mount. 10-8 Cormier. Round 2 – Staring comes out throwing and connects; he goes against the cage and Cormier decides to start trying. Grabs the clinch, working for the takedown against the cage. He lets it go and back to the middle of the cage. This feels like a fight that’s a bad contest, like Staring won a “MMA Fan gets to take on Cormier” radio contest. Cormier grabs a takedown, moves into side control. Staring gives up his back and Cormier is looking to end this. Staring monkey rolls and to his back, then onto his back again, then onto his belly some more. Cormier is looking for the finish now; he wants an amrbar and Staring is just trying not to get finished at this point. He gives up his back and Cormier is lighting hijm up at this point.

Tarec is game as well; some nice leg kicks from him. Tarec gets a nice counter and Marquardt is rocked. He goes for the takedown and gets him down, nothing really much as he’s back to his feet. Marquardt with a nice combination and Tarec goes for the takedown; Marquardt underneath and we’re playing knee the other guy in the body right now. It’s odd that this fight is actually close right now considering how much of a one-sided ass-kicking everything else on the main card was. The fans aren’t happy, either, as a close fight is something they haven’t seen for a while. 10-9 Saffiedine. Round 2 – Tarec rocks him a minute in but Marquardt gets him down. Tarec back up quickly, then to some cage dancing. Not a lot happening as I take a break to get a beer. One of those kinds of nights. I’m back and Big John breaks up the waltz I think they were doing. Marquardt with another takedown and that ain’t happening. Tarec’s as bored of that takedown as pretty much everyone is of this fight so far. Some nice combinations to end the round. 10-9 Tarec, 20-18 Tarec Round 3 – Tarec opens the round with another awesome leg kick. Nate’s leg has to be hurting now; you can hear how loudly that’s hitting. Nate goes back to trying to get a takedown and they’re doing a foxtrot against the cage. Tarec gets away and Nate misses a flying knee. And Tarec grabs the lead in a rumba against the cage. You can actually hear individual conversations in the crowd now; Tarec eats a big punch and is rocked a little and the guy in the fifth row has apparently been over served. Or he needs another hot dog, I’m not sure. Back to the middle of the cage as this is actually starting to turn into a fun fight when they’re standing. Nate’s leg is a bit bruised up right now as he’s getting more aggressive. Nate with another takedown attempt at the end of the round that goes nowhere. 10-9 Marquardt, 29-28 Tarec Round 4 – Both guys come out throwing as Tarec goes back to the leg kicks. He’s getting Faber/Aldo territory right now. Nate is getting chopped down as he’s getting desperate. Nate’s leg is all sorts of bad right now.

He’s trying to catch those kicks as their coming in but can’t quite catch ‘em; Tarec puts Nate into the cage and it’s time for an ’80s style slow dance with a minute left but Nate isn’t down with that. Back to the middle of the cage as Tarec is in control of this fight. 10-9 Tarec, 39-37 Round 5 – Tarec is jacked for this final five minutes and he might be the only one. Tarec is doing his best lumberjack impression right now as he’s looking to kick him down. He then grabs the clinch and it’s back against the cage; these two are cage-dancing so much it looks like a “Dancing with the Stars” audition. All they need is some glittery trunks, I suppose. A minute or so of that and we’re back to the middle of the cage. Nate finally decides to block a kick as his leg looks like he’s about to fall down on it. Tarec decides he really wants on this season and we’re back to cage dancing some more. 90 seconds left and he lets go but Nate is just kind of chilling, looking to win his spot on “Dancing” instead. Finally with a minute left and we’re back to the middle of the cage. 50 seconds and Tarec fakes out Nate by implying he was going to do the Charleston but takes him down instead. Round ends as Tarec pounds on him in half guard. 10-9 Tarec, 49-46 Official Result: 48-47, 49-46, 49-46 Tarec Saffediene And now … Strikeforce is gone.",Raw Data
3,"Zagoruiko skied fast and shot clean to take a dominant victory in the 15km clocking 48:04.9minutes with Ane Skrove Nossum taking silver and Monika Hojnisz bronze. Hojnisz won bronze in the mass start at the World Championships in Nove Mesto on Sunday while Semenov incurred one penalty in the 20km but still won by almost 15 seconds. The Ukrainian recorded a winning time of 52:50.2, 14.3 seconds ahead of Tobias Arwidson, who shot clean while the home nation had something to shout about as Krasimir Anev took bronze. Anev could have easily have been toasting silver however he broke both his poles on the last loop, one just as he came out of the range and the other during the lap. Heavy snowfall set in for the men's race but Semenov admitted it affected him little as he admitted to claiming an unexpected victory in Hungary. ""During the race I did not get any information from the coaches except 'everything is OK, go on, go on'. I did not expect to win,"" said Semenov. ""At the last shooting I was still very nervous and my legs were shaking. On the last loop the coaches told me I was six seconds behind Tobias. ""The French athlete ahead of me [Florent Claude] had a very good last loop and I could go behind him, this was very good for me.""",Raw Data
4,"Emily Seebohm blamed her overuse of social networking website Twitter for her failure to win Olympic gold at London 2012 as the favorite in the women's 100m backstroke, where she finished second. Australian swimmers failed to win more than one gold medal for first time since 1992 (CNN) -- Australian swimming officials have vowed to ""win back the admiration of a nation"" following the release of a damning report that blamed a ""toxic"" team environment at London 2012 which led to the country's worst Olympic pool performance in 20 years. It was the first time Australia had failed to win more than one swimming gold medal since 1992, and the subsequent independent review revealed problems throughout the team -- from lack of leadership at the top to unacceptable behavior by the athletes. ""Standards, discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the London Olympics were too loose,"" the report said, having canvassed 94 individuals and received 30 submissions. ""There were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements (such as getting drunk, misuse of prescription drugs, breaching curfews, deceit, bullying) to warrant a strong, collective leadership response that included coaches, staff and the swimmers. No such collective action was taken."" Coming soon after this month's government report claiming widespread use of drugs by Australian athletes, it is another serious blow to the country's image of sporting excellence. Why is Australia faltering at Games? Stephanie Rice, who has made an art of her pre-race rituals, was under big pressure to perform at the Australian 2012 Olympic trials in Adelaide in March. Swimming Australia said Tuesday it had already begun to address some of the issues raised in the review, and had a 100-day plan to tackle them further. ""Swimming has a proud history in this country and everyone in the sport wants to maintain and improve on the credibility and integrity which has developed over more than a century of success,"" said its president Barclay Nettlefold. ""Before we look at winning gold medals, we want to win back the admiration of the nation, and we want to engage with our swimming community like never before at every level."" One of the review's key criticisms was that team officials had been so focused on winning gold medals that the morale of the athletes suffered. Swimmers complained of being ignored if they failed to achieve expected standards, describing it as the ""Lonely Olympics"" and the ""Individual Olympics."" ""Things were quiet and weird when someone lost. You just sort of went to your room and got out of the way,"" said one in the report. Some respondents felt that team officials were only interested in presenting the most well-known swimmers to the media, with 24 of the 47-strong squad being first-time Olympians, while some did not turn up to support their colleagues on race days. ""The consequence was an undertone of divisions, now and then, us and them, men and women, the best and the rest,"" the report said. ""Poor behavior and disrespect within the team were not regulated or resisted strongly by other team members, and it was left unchecked or without consequence by staff and coaches on a number of occasions. ""Some individual incidents of unkindness, peer intimidation, hazing and just 'bad form' as a team member that were escalated to personal coaches were not addressed and had no further consequence."" Read: 'The Social Media Games' These problems were magnified by a lack of control of the team's social media activities, the report said. Emily Seebohm claimed her overuse of Twitter cost her a gold medal in the 100 meters backstroke event in which she was favorite, while Stephanie Rice made headlines after posting a picture of herself in a skimpy bikini just before the Games. Teammates Nick D'Arcy and Kenrick Monk were forced to remove a picture they posted online showing them with weapons in a U.S. gun shop. They were banned from using social media at London 2012. ""The media search for controversy is nothing new, but London was the first Games where the influence of social media was so dramatic,"" the report said. Read: Triumph and scandal - Olympians in social media spotlight ""Some athletes engaged deeply in public debate on what they were doing, how they were doing, and even on who they actually were as individuals. This served to fuel emotions, good and bad, at a time where calmness, intensive focus and consistency should have prevailed. ""Social media also allowed already disconnected athletes to seek support from sources external to the team, which again diminished the reliance on a unified team."" The report said the lack of team spirit was partly caused by letting the swimmers prepare under individual programs with their own coaches, which caused a disconnect at all levels of the squad. Meanwhile, the Olympic village environment was described as ""mayhem"" and ""a candy shop of distractions."" ""Fragmentation was compounded in the absence of familiarity and sufficient opportunities to connect formally and socially. Greater cohesion as a team would have needed to be intentional and cultivated by design,"" the report said. The Australian Sports Commission welcomed the review's findings. ""Swimming Australia has already commenced recruitment for a new high performance director and has also taken steps to improve its relationship with key stakeholders,"" said ASC chief executive Simon Hollingsworth. ""This report is a clear message to Swimming Australia to continue its reforms to enable it to return to the top table of international swimming.""",Raw Data
5,"The game became feisty even before the puck dropped as Ryan Clowe and Alexandre Burrows got into it at center ice and it remained that way. ''We know there is a lot of stake when we play them,'' Pavelski said. ''The intensity was set . . . I'd like to stay at the first puck drop but it was before that. That's the first time I've seen something like that.'' Joe Thornton also scored for the Sharks, who improved to 5-0-0. Antti Niemi made 23 saves as coach Todd McLellan earned his 200th career victory. ''We were ready to go. I think that Clowie getting us going early was huge for us,'' Thornton said. ''Every game against these guys is just a really, super competitive game, and I think we saw that again. Both teams are engaged early.'' Marleau scored two goals in each of the first four games of the season, becoming the first NHL player do pull of that trick since 1917. ''It would have been nice to keep it going,'' Marleau said. ''But I got a lucky one tonight and I'll take it.'' Burrows scored for the Canucks, who had a three-game unbeaten streak end. Cory Schneider also stopped 23 shots. ''We obviously dislike each other,'' Burrows said. ''We've seen them in the playoffs a couple of years ago. They're a Western Conference rival and they make for good games.'' Clowe tied a Sharks record with eight penalties, all in the first two periods, and a career-high 35 penalty minutes. Fights between Clowe and Zack Kassian in the first period and Douglas Murray and Aaron Volpatti in the third were lengthy and bloody. ''We're not happy about the penalties and that's all I am going to say,'' McLellan said. ''I owe Ryan Clowe my conversation. I have a lot of respect for him. I am happy we won with a good, gritty effort.'' Pavelski, Marleau and Thornton have each recorded points in the first five games for the Sharks Thornton put the Sharks on the scoreboard 43 seconds into the contest, intercepting a pass from Jason Garrison in front of the net and beating Schneider. Pavelski also stole a pass late in the first and scored. He caught Alexander Elder's pass, also in front of the net. ''I just happened to be there,'' Pavelski said. ''I think he was trying to get some wings on it and I happened to get it.'' Burrows scored midway through the second period. His shot bounced off Niemi's pads and then deflected off the back of Dan Boyle's skates and into the net. ''We made a few mistakes there that ended up in the back of net,'' Burrows said. ''But I think we bounced back pretty good. We had some chances. We had some looks, we hit some posts. At the end of the day we have to score some goals on our power play.'' Marleau, who scored his ninth goal of the season, also got a lucky bounce. Boyle's shot hit off Marleau's skate and went into the net. ''I felt something hit my foot but I was just standing there,'' Marleau said. ''I'm just trying to be in front of the net when shots are coming and creating havoc.'' Pavelski added another goal midway through the third. Notes: Thornton has 46 points (12-34) points in 39 games against the Canucks. ... Vancouver coach Alain Vigneault remains two wins away from 400. ... Canucks LW Daniel Sedin had recorded a point in his first four games. ... The Canucks were 3-0-1 against the Sharks last year. ...

6,"Stiff competition doesn't happen too often at the Pro Bowl. But this year, with the two main contenders for the MVP award suiting up for opposite sides, the game had a little extra intrigue. Looking for more scoops on your favorite New England sports teams? Check out NESN. Adrian Peterson and Peyton Manning both had solid seasons coming back from injuries that appeared likely to limit — if not end — their careers. They’re now the front-runners for the league MVP award, to be announced this week. The voting is done, but that hasn't kept Peterson from campaigning. He thinks his 2,097 rushing yards (second most in NFL history), 6.0 yards per rush, 12 touchdowns and contribution in getting the Vikings to the playoffs is enough to give him the edge over Manning’s 4,659 passing yards, 68.6 completion percentage, 37 touchdowns and No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs with the Broncos. ""I'm going to win it. I will get it,"" Peterson told Mark Kiszla of the Denver Post on Saturday. But Peterson’s boastings weren’t lost on the other guy in the race. Check out the photos as the NFL's best gather for some fun and football at the Pro Bowl. ""Everybody should play like Adrian Peterson,"" Manning reportedly said during a Pro Bowl event earlier in the week. ""The guy does everything full speed. The Pro Bowl. Promoting himself for MVP."" Peterson, who was in attendance at the event, said he enjoyed the joke. As for the Pro Bowl (Manning at that same event earlier in the week made a plea to his fellow NFL players to take the game seriously and raise the level of play), if the final score is any indication, Peterson had the last laugh as the NFC pounded the AFC on Sunday, 62-35. But it was another Viking, tight end Kyle Rudolph, who did the most damage with 122 yards and a TD for MVP honors. For Manning (6 of 12, 43 yards, 1 TD) and Peterson (five carries, 13 yards, no scores), it was a pretty quiet end to their seasons.",Raw Data
7,"First off, I had a whole different review planned than the one I am now forced to write. The title should give you some idea why. And when I say late, I mean very late – almost the last meaningful kick of the game. That isn’t to say Spurs, after Utd took the early lead, didn’t press and attack well and in numbers, but the defensive performance was imperious up until that point. Would you have taken a point against Spurs before the match? Of course you would. But I don’t think that statement ignores the context of how the game panned out. For instance, if you are 4-0 up against Chelsea until the 70th minute, but draw 4-4, do you say that is a point gained, or three points lost? An extreme example, but it was seconds away from a Utd win away at Spurs, so I think I have to say this was two points dropped instead. There was some question over whether the game would take place at all, given heavy snowfall that you may be aware of if you’ve been outside recently. But it did indeed go ahead thanks to underground heating and some groundsmen shovelling snow. However, it fell consistently throughout the match, and may have proved a bit of a distraction. Certainly, we can claim Spurs had some sort of camouflage! As for team news, De Gea continued in goal, as he has in the league for some time now. Standard back four of Rafael, Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra. A slightly odd positioning of Phil Jones sitting just in front of them it seemed, with a further midfield of Carrick (obviously), Cleverley and Kagawa. Welbeck and Van Persie up front. No surprises in the Spurs lineup, Bale, Defoe, Dempsey and co, all ready to go. A cagey start preceded the first goal. There was a slight moment of tension as Lennon struck low, forcing De Gea to parry. Fortunately, he caught up with the ball before Defoe did. Offside was given, but you can never be sure that it will be awarded. So, if anything, Tottenham looked the better side early on, before Utd got the goal. Welbeck spread the play to Cleverley, who dug into the striking technique of his to cross well towards the back post. It found the head of one Van Persie, who just eat up the chance for his 22nd goal of the season, leaving Spurs probably feeling a little hard done by. Utd did look alive, but Tottenham more so. Key man Bale was kept an eye on, and forced inside onto his relatively less dangerous right foot, if possible. The defence did a stirling job of this, before Bale did finally let fly with the right towards the end of the half. No change in the scoreline at half time though. However, Spurs drank some Lucozade and started the next phase with more vigour. Defoe struck wide within seconds and Bale tried to improvise an outside-of-the-boot shot that went safely over the goal joint. The clearest chance fell to Dempsey as the defence suffered a rare split, but De Gea’s right knee diverted the ball out for a corner. His shot-stopping, as is always made clear, is not in doubt. Kagawa made way for Rooney to complete his league return, and he was in the middle of the action instantly. He went down in the box from a Caulker challenge, but the ref waved the penalty appeal away. To be fair, from HIS viewpoint, it was inconclusive, it looked more obvious from the linesman’s view. It was to him Rooney gestured, but in vain. Opinion after the fact seems to be that Utd were hard done by with this decision. In the week, I think Giggs silenced his ridiculous critics as to his supposedly dwindling talents, and if it needed to be done, Ferdinand, solid as a rock throughout, then did the same for his cause. Lennon ran through and fed Defoe, who steadied himself to smack in the equaliser. Across surged Rio, timing his intervention perfectly to divert the oncoming shot away for a corner. Majestic defending from a still very classy player. After that, I felt Utd were pumped up enough to see this game out and claim the win. Sadly, it turned out not to be. Spurs kept going and deep into injury time, in came the cross, De Gea didn’t punch away sufficiently, the ball came back across the box, and there was Dempsey to spin and turn the ball home. No time to do anything about it, sealing the result as a draw. The defence looked gutted, and well they might, they were terrific for all but that last couple of seconds, and how many times have we been able to say that this season? In fact, I’ll go as far as saying that was our best defensive performance of the season, despite the equaliser. So, as I said at the start, the nature of the game leads me to think two points dropped. The gap at the top of the table is five points, not seven. Attention has been drawn to De Gea who, despite some very impressive shot-stopping, is very very vulnerable under the cross. He isn’t a commanding presence and is blocked easily by a crowded penalty box. The punch towards the end wasn’t a good connection, and more importantly it put him out of position. Perhaps if he had remained in place, Vidic may have dealt with it, or the play across the box would have come closer to him, making a save more likely. I think he is a excellent keeper in the making, but it’s this particular part of his game that still worries me. FA Cup action next against Fulham to enjoy next weekend, but first, your thoughts on the Spurs encounter below.",Raw Data
8,"For all of the drama swirling around MLS stars in 2012, the primary talking points from this year arose from more mundane occurrences. This isn't David Beckham's league any more. Thierry Henry isn't required to pick up the slack next year, either. Landon Donovan and Robbie Keane may have spurred Los Angeles to a second consecutive title, but MLS isn't their property. And Rafa Márquez never even entered this discussion before he decamped for Club Léon to repair his battered reputation. Stars matter. They always do. But, as this year showed, it’s collective strength that continues to carry the league as a whole. Stars draw eyeballs, but it was the grinders who created MLS’ signature teams during the regular season. No club embodied that theme quite like the San Jose Earthquakes. The Supporters' Shield winners missed the postseason a year ago. They returned in style after proceeding through the regular season with an aggressive, robust approach and a potent attack spearheaded by Chris Wondolowski. The former reserve team player continued his three-year tear through MLS by tying Roy Lassister's single-season goal scoring record (26 goals) and winning his first MVP award. Or how about Sporting Kansas City? Their star midfielder Graham Zusi came in third in the MVP balloting, but his team landed atop the Eastern Conference by once again relying on its 4-3-3 setup to unsettle opponents. SKC’s fundamental tenets – a reliance on pace, power and pressure – embody the strengths usually associated with the league. Its primary operators – including defender of the year Matt Besler, emerging U.S. national team midfielder Zusi and new Wigan recruit Roger Espinoza chief among them – deserved all the praise. One knock on the league, and it’s a fair one, is that the winning teams tend to all use this same, dogged approach. Do credit some MLS teams with trying to experiment, and for beating the reeds in the Americas. Some of these arrivals – including newcomer of the year Federico Higuaín in Columbus and Houston midfielder Boniek Garcia – enjoyed immediate success. Other signings failed to meet initial expectations and watched as veterans acquired from more traditional outposts – former Anderlecht center back Victor Bernárdez, ex-Wolfsburg defender Arne Friedrich and former South Korea fullback Young-Pyo Lee – eclipsed their contributions. But MLS has the latitude to develop along a measured course and it has and will continue to make a few errors along the way. The standard of play must continue to increase as the years progress and the players’ wages must accommodate that growth. But the league is no longer fighting just to stay alive – a triumph given its not-too-distant past. MLS’ challenge now involves finding a way to sustain current upward trajectory while riding through any temporary setbacks – homophobic epithets uttered by its players, petulant displays toward the beleaguered and derided referee crews and rugged tackles on the handful of truly skilled players in the league, for example – to the cause. Consistency and competence in New York and Toronto would help matters significantly, but other positive developments off the field ensured the growth continued this season. Attendance climbed for the third consecutive season and surpassed six million for the first time with Portland, Seattle and Vancouver driving interest from the Pacific Northwest. Houston moved from the aging Robertson Stadium to the gleaming, soccer-specific BBVA Compass Stadium. Montréal joined as the league's 19th team and succeeded in its inaugural season by combining Canadian, Italian and Quebecois influences. A deal to place the 20th team in Queens appears likely at some point in 2013. Who were this year's best XI in Major League Soccer? Find out. And with all of those developments on and off the field, the stars still created the buzz and determined the fate of MLS Cup yet again. Beckham capped his tumultuous MLS career with a second consecutive title with Donovan and Keane forming a particularly potent duo up front. Donovan dropped hints that he may step away from the game for a period after displaying his credentials yet again. (He also stoked the ridiculous debates about his place in the American game yet again – which may have been the point.) Henry dazzled for much of the regular season and then joined Keane to comprise the primary components of the standard off-season loan rumor mill. The funny thing is that even in this new world, MLS’ big stars still divert attention away from the rank and file occurrences deserving of more adulation. MLS isn't really a star’s league any more – except here on the sports pages. Kyle McCarthy writes about the beautiful game for FOX Soccer, the Boston Herald and several other publications.

9,"In the final game of the triple-header with Melbourne, it was the Kangaroos who trimphed by five points, 7.6 (48) to 6.8 (44). It took a Aaron Black goal with 40 second on the clock to put the Kangaroos in front and Shane Edwards had a chance to win it for Richmond but his shot sailed wide and missed everything. The Tigers, having backed up from their win over Melbourne in the second game, came out strong in the final game of the night and looked to be heading for an unlikely win before the North Melborne comeback. The Kangaroos join Collingwood as the only other undefeated team with two more round-robin clashes to come. Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar. Majak Daw provided the highlight of the night, taking the ball just outside the 50m arc he jinked around Tigers defender Steven Morris with a strong fend before running in and slotting a classy goal. It was a big night for the AFL's first Sudanese-born player and will go a long way to him securing an AFL debut in round one. Kangaroos coach Brad Scott was pleased with his big-man's effort but tempered expectations. ""He's in contention, but I think Daniel Currie was a terrific story tonight. He's one of a number of players we've got who play (Daw's) position,'' Scott said. Richmond were well served by their leaders, Trent Cotchin, Brett Deledio and Dustin Martin, were all strong during the second game. Tigers coach Damien Hardwick was pleased with his players effort, despite the narrow loss. ""Our intensity, our ability to tackle and cause turnovers was outstanding,'' he said. Earlier, the Tigers inflicted a second-straight defeat on Melbourne, after the Demons had lost to North Melbourne in the opener at Etihad Stadium. The fresh Tigers took advantage of Melbourne backing up after the first game to register a scrappy 15-point win, 1.2.9 (30) to 2.2 (14). The Tigers burst out of the blocks, Cotchin starting brightly as his side dominated the midfield and had eight scoring shots to the Demons' one in the first half. Riewoldt and Vickery each kicked a first-half goal, while running defender Bachar Houli, who had a strong game, booted a nine-point super goal. Small defender Steven Morris was also good for the Tigers, blanketing Aaron Davey and winning plenty of the ball. But he gave Melbourne their only goal of the first half, giving away a free kick and 50m penalty to put Jack Watts in range to goal. Watts, who played in defence, was among the Demons' best and had a big hand in Richmond not kicking further clear in the second half. Melbourne draftee Jimmy Toumpas had an impressive debut, with eight touches and a goal, while reigning best-and-fairest winner Nathan Jones was good for the Demons in both of their matches.

In the opening game, Majak Daw showed glimpses of his exciting athletic potential in the Kangaroos two-point win. Both teams showed off new faces but it was the Kangaroos who prevailed 1.4.5 (38) to 0.5.6 (36). While Daw, elevated to North's main list at the end of last season after three years as a rookie, didn't do a lot, what he did do stood out. The powerful 195cm forward-ruckman took a strong pack mark in defence midway through the first half. Soon after he produced a nice ruck tap from a boundary throw-in to set up a nine-point super goal for ex-Port Adelaide recruit Ben Jacobs. It was a bright start in Kangaroos colours for Jacobs, who had set up North's first goal with a kick into attack which allowed Lindsay Thomas to take a high-leaping mark over Demons recruit David Rodan. Another Melbourne recruit, Shannon Byrnes, was involved in letting in the opposition for a goal later in the half, being run down by Kangaroos veteran Brent Harvey, with the turnover setting up Lachie Hansen to mark and goal. There were a few good signs for the Demons. Big-leaping Jeremy Howe kicked two second-half goals from marks, to tighten the contest after the Kangaroos threatened to run away with it. The Demons would have been thrilled to see hulking 18-year-old Jesse Hogan use his body cleverly to mark late in the first half, then thread through a goal from the pocket. The only problem is they'll have to wait more than a year to watch him do something similar in a game for premiership points, as the under-aged recruit is only allowed to participate in the pre-season this year. Nathan Jones continued his best-and-fairest form from last season, while midfield father-son recruit Jack Viney had some good moments, but ex-Collingwood key forward Chris Dawes had a quiet start in Demons colours. Captain Andrew Swallow was North's best player.",Raw Data
10,"Washington offensive tackle Trent Williams won't play in the Pro Bowl after being hurt early Friday in a brawl at a Honolulu nightclub. NFL officials and local police said Friday night the first-time all-star was hurt in a fight that injured three men, sending two to the hospital. One man was arrested and five others are being investigated for assault, but not Williams, police said. When asked whether Williams was being investigated for assault, Honolulu police spokeswoman Michelle Yu said: ''I would not say that.'' The league said the third-year pro will be on the sideline for the Pro Bowl game Sunday and won't lose his status as a member of the NFC team. Officials say he'll be paid a full Pro Bowl share. Redskins teammate Jammal Brown said on Twitter that Williams needed seven stitches. ''Wasn't his fault. ... He did nothing wrong,'' Brown said. Williams was replaced on the NFC team by Minnesota tackle Matt Kalil, who becomes one of seven Vikings on the NFC roster. The Pro Bowl players have been practicing in Hawaii since Wednesday for a game in jeopardy unless the quality of play improves. The Pro Bowl appearance is marking something of a personal comeback for Williams, who was suspended four games in 2011 for testing positive multiple times for marijuana. The 24-year-old former first-round pick in 2009 owned up to his mistake and worked to rebuild his reputation. He was elected a team captain on offense this season.",Raw Data
11,"Ken Rosenthal has been the senior baseball writer for FOXSports.com since August 2005. He appears weekly on MLB on FOX. Follow him on Twitter. Good luck to the San Francisco Giants trying to figure out what catcher Buster Posey is worth long term. See which MLB stars earn the highest annual salaries, who's in the $150 million club and who makes the most at each position. It’s not a stretch to imagine Posey replacing Derek Jeter as the game’s standard-bearer. Heck, the 25-year-old Posey already is more accomplished than Jeter at a comparable stage of his career, despite appearing in only 308 regular-season games. Both players won Rookie of the Year awards and two World Series championships in their first three seasons. But Posey last season captured two honors that Jeter never has won, a batting title and MVP award. Ka-ching! Posey and the Giants recently agreed on an $8 million salary for 2013, a record settlement for a player in his first year of arbitration (the Philadelphia Phillies’ Ryan Howard earned $10 million in his first year, but “won” his salary in a hearing). The two sides have mutual interest in reaching a long-term agreement, but no real urgency to complete such a deal, major league sources say. Which probably is a good thing, seeing as how this baby could take time. Posey is unique because of his special accomplishments, and because no one can predict how long he will remain at catcher, the position where his value is highest. Confused by MLB's transaction rules? You're not alone. We explain it all. He started 111 games at catcher and 29 at first base last season, and should be athletic enough to remain behind the plate for many years. But the moment he becomes a full-time corner player — assuming that is where he will land — his offensive production will be less extraordinary. Catchers’ salaries generally are lower due to the risk of injury, but Posey figures to make at least $40 million combined in his final three years of arbitration (he qualified for the extra year as a “Super Two” player). He could seek a monster 10-year agreement, but might prefer a seven-year deal that would make him eligible for free agency at 32 — an age at which Victor Martinez and Jason Varitek landed their last big contracts. So, let’s do the math: Three arbitration years worth $40 million plus four free-agent years worth $80 million would amount to seven years, $120 million. And yes, given where Posey is starting in arbitration, his free-agent years almost certainly would be worth $20 million per season, if not more. That $120 million is just an estimate — and it might be conservative, considering all of the game’s new revenues. Then again, the Giants might want more of a discount for signing Posey this early in his process, especially when he has played only one full season. They also might contend that he already has suffered one major, albeit freakish, injury — the broken fibula and torn ankle ligaments that ended his 2011 season in late May. These players wore the Tools of Ignorance with honor. Who are the all-time best catchers? Again, it’s not an easy calculation. Matt Swartz, who does an outstanding job projecting arbitration salaries for MLBTradeRumors.com, pegged Posey’s number for 2013 at $5.9 million. Seemed reasonable, considering that no player with as few plate appearances as Posey had ever earned more than $3.75 million in arbitration, according to MLBTR. Well, Posey beat Swartz’s projection by $2.1 million — and that was just on a one-year deal. Who knows how high the long-term number might go? Posey’s agent, Jeff Berry, could even counter the argument that his client would be less valuable at a position such as first base, contending that Posey likely would stay healthier and perhaps hit for even greater power. For now, Posey wants to catch, he’s good at it and he seems to invite minimal wear-and-tear with his playing style. He’s worth a ton of money. The question is how much. To understand why Los Angeles Dodgers president Stan Kasten never discloses the lengths of contracts for non-playing personnel, consider the case of Don Mattingly, the manager inherited by the team’s new owners. Mattingly recently told Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times that the team declined his request at the end of last season to exercise his option for 2014. Plaschke then posed the obvious question, with Mattingly entering the final year of his contract: Why are the Dodgers, after committing to a payroll of more than $200 million, going with a lame-duck manager in '13? Some with the Dodgers dispute that assessment of Mattingly’s status, contending that the team should be good enough for him to avoid questions about his job security — and that any perceived distraction might only be a figment of the media’s imagination. Perhaps, but I’m guessing the Dodgers will address the matter sooner rather than later, lest they undercut Mattingly’s authority in a clubhouse with no shortage of sizable egos. General manager Ned Colletti, who agreed to an extension last September, hinted at such a resolution to Plaschke, saying, “It will all get worked out.” As Mattingly said, “… you would have liked for them to pick up the extension, so the players could be shown confidence. You never want it to be like, after a couple of bad games, people are saying, ‘Oh, are they gonna change managers now?’ ” LA's ballpark one of the oldest in baseball. Take a look back at the history of Chavez Ravine's jewel. Of course, managers and coaches under long-term deals also can get fired — ask Ozzie Guillen, who lasted only one season of a four-year, $15 million deal with the Miami Marlins, or Mike Brown, whom the Los Angeles Lakers fired after a 1-5 start despite owing him a reported $11 million on his four-year, $18 million contract. Still, the Dodgers would be wise to eliminate the issue entirely. Club officials privately rave about Mattingly. If they truly believe in him, they will not only exercise his option, but also award him an extension. Just don’t expect them to announce the length of Mattingly’s new deal. That way, the team can avoid the question in the future, which is just how Kasten likes it. A FLAW IN THE YANKEES' PLAN? The Yankees’ benefits for reducing their payroll below the $189 million luxury-tax threshold in 2014 might not be as lucrative as they originally envisioned. The team would realize one financial incentive by meeting its payroll target — a rollback in its luxury-tax rate from a potential 50 percent to 17.5 percent if it again exceeded the threshold. But the second anticipated benefit — a rebate in the new market-disqualification revenue-sharing program — might fall well below the Yankees’ expectations. Under the labor agreement, the 15 clubs in the largest markets will forfeit an increasing percentage of their revenue-sharing proceeds starting in 2013, and become ineligible for any such money by '16. The revenue-sharing funds that would have gone to those clubs then would be redistributed to payors such as the Yankees. The idea is to motivate certain big-market clubs — the Toronto Blue Jays, for example — to increase their revenues, knowing that they no longer would qualify for revenue-sharing money. From that perspective, the plan appears to be working — the Blue Jays, Washington Nationals and Atlanta Braves are among the big-market clubs that anticipate higher revenues next season, according to major league sources. Such developments would reduce the size of the market-disqualification pot — and in turn reduce the percentage of that pot the Yankees would receive. The Yankees anticipated $10 million from the market-disqualification program if they got below the luxury-tax threshold one time and $40 million if they stayed under it from 2014 to '16, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post. If those figures turn out to be less than the Yankees projected, it would raise the question of why the team acted so diligently to get under $189 million by 2014. Yankees officials, however, maintain that the team’s offseason strategy has not been influenced by future luxury-tax considerations. They say the front office simply is not enamored with the players on the market.",Raw Data
12,"This is the problem with bringing in clubhouse cancers, no matter the talent, size or potential behind the malignancy. This is why LeBron James became an even better player an NBA champion once he became a better guy. This is why the seductive power of the beautiful and the powerful is a siren song leading nowhere good if not counterbalanced by some character, some introspection, some maturity. In NBA terms, Dwight Howard is as beautiful and powerful as they come. Hes a 6-foot-11, 265-pound force of basketball nature who, at 27 years old, is already one of the leagues two most physically gifted players. That alluring fact was on display Sunday, when he tied a career high with 26 rebounds in a loss to the Denver Nuggets. But even before Monday's news that a torn labrum will sideline Howard indefinitely, it was already clear that Howard is also every bit the cancer his ego-fueled, one-man circus in Orlando the past few years told us he was. That fact was rammed down the throats of Lakers fans everywhere with Mondays New York Daily News report, attributed to a source, that Howard had to be restrained from fighting Kobe Bryant following a New Year Days loss to the Philadelphia 76ers. The beautiful and the powerful can be tempting to those of us living in the real world, a balm to our everydayness and our grounded ways. At least until they realize the sun and moon and stars do not in fact revolve around them. And then comes the hard jolt of fact: Beautiful, brilliant and powerful people can also be so self-absorbed and unmoored from the niceties of everyday life that it turns out their contempt, lack of self-awareness and destructive insouciance are their actual defining traits. That was on display this past weekend, too, with Howard. It has been on display all season long if youve known where to look. It was on display in the worst way if he really wanted to fight one of the greatest Lakers of all time after a loss. Trying to fight Kobe Bryant? We can't say for sure what happened in that locker room, but its looking a lot like Dwight Howard is a malignancy that not even Kobe Bryant can overcome, outwit or overcompensate for. This past weekend, before the reported New Years altercation with Kobe came to light, Howard first complained about friendship issues among the Lakers, as if playing Parcheesi with Pau, Kobe and Nash or organizing a group karaoke outing could fix the teams problems. Those guys on the Clippers team, they really enjoy each other off the court, and it shows, Howard told ESPN. Its something we have to do to get better. We have to play like we like each other. Even if we don't want to be friends off the court, whatever that may be, when we step in between the lines or we step in the locker room or the gym, we have to respect each other and what we bring to the table. When I read this, my jaw nearly dropped to the floor. It was a level of hypocrisy so strong it would be funny if it werent directly at odds with the Lakers desperate need to start winning, right now, today. The very thing Howard was bemoaning is one of his singular failures, but, of course, hypocrites often find in others the faults actually simmering in themselves. The Lakers are 15-18, putting them at a very underachieving 11th in the Western Conference. Forget whether the Lakers can get on a roll and earn some home-court advantage in the playoffs. Its time to start worrying about making the postseason at all. Thats a crisis, and in a crisis your leaders, your talent, your high-priced stars must be the ones to calm the troops and instill a sense of confidence. They must rally around the lesser mortals among them. They must support coaches who are certainly embattled in the hope it makes their jobs easier. But not Dwight Howard. No, thats not in his arsenal. How could it be? Hes finding out the universe does not revolve around him, that the laws of physics and reality do not in fact suspend themselves because hes not happy, so forget everyone else. Lets attack the star player instead. Lets talk about how the losing coming from a lack of friendship. Lets spread that blame around far and wide. Its the like each other comments that really tell the tale. Perhaps no one likes Dwight because the Lakers locker room revolves around the idea of championships rather than overgrown, uber-talented children playing at basketball to soothe their needy egos. Last month, when Steve Nash returned from injury to lead the Lakers to a dazzling and much-needed win over the Golden State Warriors, I stood in an ebullient Lakers locker room. They were happy. They did like each other. They heaped praise on Nash, on his return, on the win. They felt good about the future. They had won, and that was enough to bring them together for at least one night. Well, everyone but Howard. Dwight, having scored only 11 points and corralled six rebounds in the win, sat and pouted. He was surly at his locker. He didnt smile, not once, despite the much-needed sign of progress and what at the time seemed like a very good omen in Nashs debut. Even if we don't want to be friends off the court, whatever that may be . . . we have to respect each other and what we bring to the table . . . Not so much. Thats a cancer. A guy who cant root for his own teammates. A guy who cant be happy with a win because the win didnt bolster the idea it should be all about him. A guy who, a few weeks later, then goes off on those same teammates for supposedly being guilty of the very thing Dwight has made his career staple: Selfishness, loner-ism, the me-me-me-me-me-me patter of his worldview. Heres a guy who, if reports are true, has the gall to go after Kobe Bryant in Kobe Bryants locker room? Dwight got only one thing right this weekend: Teams, no matter how talented, do not win if they do not like one another, or themselves. The Heat learned that two years ago, when they collapsed under the weight of their own drama and ego and pettiness. When their own transcendent talent undercut his skills with his own issues.But that team at least made the Finals, and the Heat certainly showed us we can all improve, we are all redeemable. These Lakers look like making the playoffs could be tough, so they need that change and self-awareness to kick in soon. And while there are many reasons lack of depth, an offensive system so far that is not working, a diminished Pau Gasol, the defensive effort equal to a team of octogenarians its Dwight who represents the biggest problem. Already, the trade talks have started. Already, his siren song has led the Lakers astray. Does any of this mean Dwight Howard is a bad person? Not at all. Hes probably a very nice man. But thats not the point, just as it wasnt two years ago with LeBron James. The question for the Lakers is this: Is Dwight Howard inflicting bad things upon the people who count on him, who pay him, who gave him their loyalty, who need his help? Of course he is. As any self-absorbed, blame-everyone-but-himself star learns to, Dwight has taken his own failures and strived to discover them in those around him. Its self-preservation, you see. How else to keep believing the moon and the stars and the sun revolve around your magnificence if you have to admit youre not infallible? Warped chemistry? Bad blood? A need to root for your teammates? Hell yes, Dwight, those are the issues at play. Now, physician, heal thyself.",Raw Data
13,"MELBOURNEThat wasnt a bad effort from Andy Murray, right? He made his third straight Grand Slam final, and fourth straight at a major event. He beat Roger Federer for the first time at one of these things, in as convincing a five-setter as youre likely to see. And, as the Daily Mail put it back home in the U.K., he made a strong claim to being the second best tennis player in the world at the moment, behind only the great Djokovic. But if you thought that would give Muzz any satisfaction, you would be wrong, very wrong, according to the Mail. It only makes things far worse. MURRAYS REAL AGONY IS FALLING JUST SHORT OF TRULY GREAT DJOKOVIC Andy Murray is the second best tennis player in the world,"" Martin Samuel writes. ""Bummer. Turns out second, which must have looked so appealing when he was fourth, and then third, is still a pretty frustrating place to be. ""More so, probably, because now Murray gets to stand next to more trophies, but without being permitted to touch; he gets to give speeches, as the warm-up act for the winner. He gets to be very polite to everybody and have everybody be polite about him. You put up a good fight, you played your part in a great match. Lets have a big hand for Andy. At that moment, second must suck way more than, say, 14th. There you have itthe better you do, the worse off your feel. Why didnt anyone warn Murray about this years ago? He might have done the smart thing and studied marketing instead. Anyway, its good to have Muzz the loser to kick around again, isnt it? Heres what else the world press is saying about Murray, Djoker, and Vika, among other people, the day after the Aussie Open. ***** The Melzer Moment Simon Briggs of the Telegraph has an interesting nugget from Djokovics coach, Marian Vajda, which I hadnt heard before. Vajda claims that the turning point toward No. 1 for Novak wasnt the Davis Cup win in 2010, as is so often mentioned, it was a loss that Nole had suffered earlier that year from two sets and a break up to Jurgen Melzer at Roland Garros. That was the turnaround, mentally, Vajda said, After that defeat, he convinced himself that he had to work harder."" He was always great,"" Vajda continued. ""He was No. 3 in the world, but he wasnt patient. He said, When, when, when? I said, It takes time, you have to work on this and this and this.'"" Djokovic didnt dispute that assessment. It did change things, he said. [In 2010] my game was not there. I changed my serve technique. I had a lot of mental issues. Every single pro athlete has to go through this crisis period in his pro career. I lost that match [to Melzer] and then from Wimbledon on, in the second part of the year, I started playing much better and being more confident on the court. You might think this is kind of an insult to Jurgen Melzer. Youre wrong. Now he finally has something to tell the grandkids about his career: I was the player who inspired Novak Djokovic to say to himself, I must be doing something wrong if Im losing to this guy. ***** Feathery Touch Speaking of speaking to the grandkids, Scott Gullan of the Herald Sun imagines Murray, years from now, telling his own grandchildren why he lost the 2013 Aussie Open final. (Apparently, as the years go by, Muzz will move on from his beloved lemon sodas to harder liquids.) He will slowly put down his pint, Gullan writes of this hypothetically soused and rambling Murray of the future, and with a wry grin say in his Scottish drawl: A bloody feather beat me. In Melbourne these stupid birds called seagulls hang out at the top of the stadiums roof and shed their feathers. I had to wait for this feather to get out of the way and it totally threw me off. Then Murray falls silent and the kids think he has actually nodded off. After guzzling down the pint, he then reaches for the bottle of Scotch whiskey next to him and takes a big swig. He starts mumbling as the parents arrive to sneak the rest of the kids away."" That bloody feather. The feather. I cant believe one tiny little feather.... ***** Kisses (of Grudging Respect) for Vika Of all of the columnists who held forth on the Timeout, Patrick Smith of The Australian was the harshest. He gave Azarenka no quarter, and didnt change his opinion after her locked rib explanation. But today Smith, while still maintaining that the timeout was gamesmanship, accords Azarenka a measure of respect for her victory. Writing in the second personafter a few paragraphs, I felt like I was reading Bright Lights, Big City again he finishes with these words for her: You should feel proud. You beat not one opponent but thousands. Chokers dont win those sorts of matches. Champions do. Victoria Azarenka does. ***** Shark Attack Thats the headline above Linda Pearces and Greg Baums Azarenka article in The Age today. It refers to her coach Sam Sumyks description of how the press went after Vika this week. Youre sharks, guys, Sumyk informed us. And he was being polite. I understand you have to do your job, but sometimes you can maybe do it a little moreI dont know, I dont have the right word, I dont want to be mean. What was the word he was looking for? Professionally? Civilly? In both cases, hed have a point. Azarenka was blasted even after giving what I thought was the plausible explanation of the locked rib. I didnt see ESPNs coverage, but it seems Sumyk was especially unhappy with the networks commentators. Its also true that the grilling she received in the interview room right after her match with Stephens was intense. But at that point, Azarenka had twice said that she had left the court only because she was mentally overwhelmed. That version of the story needed to be questioned. Vika surely regrets walking off. Media-wise, she probably regrets it even more that she did against a popular new American star. ***** Monday, Monday, Cant Trust That Day Remember the ATPs U.S. Open boycott threat, over playing tennis on a Monday night? The tournament fired back while we werent looking. This weekend USTA president Gordon Smith told Neil Harman of the Times of London, Weve done our due diligence, weve consulted the players all along the way. Smith said the Open would have suffered a $10 million shortfall if it had chosen to stage the final on Sunday [and eliminate the Super Saturday semifinals], Harman writes. The damage was limited to a $1 million loss with the Monday fixture. We didnt think it right was for us to take a $10 million hit, Smith says, and at the same time be deciding on significant prize money increases. Super Saturday, with six hours of mens tennis, was hugely attractive to CBS. The Opens current contract with the network runs out next year. ***** Muzzs Last Meal The Guardian finds space for one final Andy Murray-does-the-hard-yards article. Or, as the papers headline puts it: TEAM MURRAY HAILS TRANSFORMATION OF THE LIGHTWEIGHT WHO BECAME A WINNER The piece provides a helpful, if slightly disturbing, timeline of Murrays average training day in Miami. Theres beach running at 6:30 in the morning, a protein shake breakfast, a protein bar snack, 90 minutes of hot yoga, an afternoon pasta load-up, 400 meter sprints, and then, for fun, fruit and yogurt topped off with more protein bars and shakes. Sounds awful, doesnt it? I had noticed over the last two weeks that Murray hadnt mentioned one of the few things about his personal life that he has mentioned in the past: His love of Japanese food. In his obsessive quest for greatness, had he robbed himself even of that? No reason to fear. According to the Guardian, Murray finishes each day at 7 P.M. by wolfing down 50 pieces of sushi.",Raw Data
14,"BRISTOL, Conn -- By the time Phoenix coach Corey Gaines left the ESPN studio where he had just found out that his team was awarded the No. 1 pick in the 2013 WNBA Draft and made it back to the Green Room for all the team representatives, he already had over 40 text messages. One of them was from franchise player and former No. 1 overall pick herself Diana Taurasi. All she had to say was, WOW. The Mercury came into the lottery with the second highest chance of earning the top overall pick (27.6 percent) and in a draft full of wow factor, as this class features three game-changing prospects in Baylors Brittney Griner, Delawares Elena Delle Donne and Notre Dames Skylar Diggins, the Mercury emerged as the big winners. Chicago, which had the best record of the four teams in the lottery and only a 10.4 chance of getting the top pick, jumped up to the No. 2 spot. Tulsa received the No. 3 pick while Washington, the team with the most ping pong balls to start the day and a 44.6 percent chance of winning the No. 1 pick, fell to the No. 4 selection. For the first time ever in large part due to the unprecedented hype surrounding the three budding superstars in this class the draft lottery could be seen live. And, since he was seen by millions on SportsCenter, that is one reason so many were quick to text Gaines. The other: that he now has the chance to draft Griner. Griner, who led Baylor to a 40-0 record and a national title last year, is the crowned jewel of this star-studded class. Simply put, ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo says there is no other player like Griner in the world. The 6-foot-8 center will instantly become one of the top defenders in the league she averaged over five blocks a game her junior year and is just 64 rejections away from setting the NCAA record for career blocks and her size makes her hard to stop on the offensive end. Griner averaged 23.2 points her junior year, to go along with 9.5 rebounds, and, confirming that she is like no other womens player walking the planet, can dunk with ease. As a result, despite the fact that she doesnt fit Phoenixs traditional mold for a post player, Griner, if selected No. 1, could have an immense and immediate impact on both the Mercury and the league. I think this year, with the picks that are coming out, you cant go wrong, Gaines said before the draft. I think its a little easier this year. In the past you may have had to draft to what fits your team, but this year I think there are some players out there that are game-changers and league-changers. The most influential of those players is Griner and Lobo agrees that she can succeed in Phoenix, especially when you factor in that her stellar defense could trigger Phoenixs lethal transition game via rebounds and blocks. Even if you look at a team like Phoenix that has traditionally liked really mobile post players that can shoot the three, (Griners) not that, but it doesnt matter because they can just put her in the middle and do whatever they want in terms of what they want to run defensively, Lobo said. So she would still fit in perfectly there even though shes not a prototypical player for their system. The teams in this years lottery especially those that finished in the top three will look at this years draft as the first step to a future championship. Nowhere is that more evident than in Phoenix. Much like how Minnesota winning the lottery in 2011 and landing Maya Moore helped them win a championship last year, the Mercury have by and large parlayed their past two No. 1 selections into trophies. In 2004, Phoenix selected Diana Taurasi and in 2007 the Mercury had the No. 1 overall pick and traded it to Minnesota for Tangela Smith. Both of those players were major contributors to the franchises championships in 2007 and 2009. When you factor in that the team already has what Gaines calls a solid four in Taurasi, Penny Taylor, DeWanna Bonner and Candice Dupree, as well as a promising rookie in Samantha Prahalis, the future is looking blindingly bright in Phoenix. Obviously were really excited, Phoenix President and COO Amber Cox said. It means a lot to our fans, it means a lot to our organization. Were just really excited and kind of speechless at the moment. We came into the Draft Lottery today, Corey and I, with no expectations and, again, like he said, we knew that anyone we would be able to add to the pieces we already have would be good. This is obviously icing on the cake. Phoenix isnt the only team feeling lucky after Wednesdays lottery. The Sky, who were fighting for a playoff spot just a week ago, defied the odds and earned the second overall selection. Forward Swin Cash, Chicagos representative, may have created some of her own good fortune by bringing a good luck charm to the lottery two American flag patches given to her by U.S. soldiers while she was in London for the Olympics. The patches, she says, worked as she helped the U.S. to a gold medal and they seemed to work in the lottery. After I heard Tulsa at three I was just sitting there and I think my eyes got big, I was like Oh man, its gonna happen, its gonna happen. Cash said. But at the end of the day, Im just happy to have the second pick. Theres just so many different ways that our coach can go with this. Chicago already has a strong core with Cash, fellow Olympian Sylvia Fowles and rising star Epiphanny Prince, so another bonafide star would make the Sky a top contender in the East. Another team on the rise is the Tulsa Shock, who won nine games in 2012 after only winning three in 2011. They have a sold group of young players and played the entire season without 6-foot-8 center Liz Cambage, the No.2 pick in the 2011 draft. Tulsa Owner Bill Cameron says he thinks Tulsa is a team on the upswing and this drafts lottery, where they earned the No. 3 pick, is just another step in that direction. We know were going to get a really, really solid player at three and theres still a lot of things to shake out, Tulsa President Steve Swetoha said. We have a few months to go but they say they have three really good players in this draft and we have one of those slots so I dont think we can ask for anything more at this point. Obviously were disappointed that we didnt get the No. 1 pick -- if I said we arent disappointed Id be lying to you -- so it is what it is, and we feel good about where we fell. Unfortunately for Washington, a team that won just five games in 2012 and is looking for a new coach and GM, the outcome of the lottery cannot by what it had hoped for. I hadnt even really thought about this class I dont even know who the fourth pick might be but its safe to say fourth will be a little more disappointed than the others, Lobo said. As a whole, however, there should be no disappointment around the league. The WNBA is likely to have three collegiate icons among others enter the league in this Aprils draft and the excitement is already apparent. Its great for the league because the players that are coming in to the league in this years draft have visibility at the collegiate level, Cash said. Theyve also been very engaging in social media and I think mainstream media is talking about them, so I think its going to be great for the league and great for the teams that get them. The importance of the draft is at an all-time high this year and WNBA President Laurel J. Richie may have summed it up best before the draft. The fact that the draft lottery, for the first time ever, is going to be live on SportsCenter, I mean it doesnt get any better than that. Wow.",Raw Data
15,"Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com. He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. Derek Jeter has been the face of American baseball for nearly two decades. He plays the marquee position for the sport’s flagship franchise. He has five World Series rings and a .308 postseason batting average. You name the category, he’s the active leader — championships, endorsements, tabloid ink spilled in the name of his dating life. And when the call came to play for his country in the World Baseball Classic, he answered. Twice. Jeter batted a combined .347 in the 2006 and 2009 tournaments, which surprised no one. He wins at life, and he does it on merit. But Jeter won’t play for his country at this year’s WBC, now barely more than six weeks away. He’s still recovering from the broken ankle he suffered during last year’s American League Championship Series. Otherwise, he would play — particularly when considering his friend and mentor Joe Torre is managing Team USA. In all likelihood, this was Jeter’s last chance to play in the WBC. He faces enough skepticism about his ability to handle shortstop this year at age 38 — let alone in an international competition four years from now. Sooner rather than later, the unofficial consortium of Major League Baseball, USA Baseball, Madison Avenue and (of course!) the media will settle on the new avatar for our national pastime. We have no shortage of candidates: Buster Posey, Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and David Price are some of the first names that come to mind. How convenient that the WBC will take place this March, so these stars can make an even greater imprint on fans across the country, and … When Team USA’s provisional roster was announced Thursday morning, not one of those six names was on it. Team USA absolutely has enough talent to win anyway. And young, charismatic stars like Adam Jones and Giancarlo Stanton will be on the team. But the collective no-show of their peers is, in a word, disappointing. This is not to question the character or patriotism of the players who have opted out. Some may be feeling pressure from their teams to stay in camp. (Such arm-twisting, by the way, is prohibited under the MLB-sanctioned WBC charter.) Others may be concerned with the injury risk, which is misguided. MLB research shows there were more April disabled list assignments, by percentage, in ’06 and ’09 for players who did not play in the WBC than for those who did. Only about 4 percent of MLB players are college graduates. See who's at the top of the class. Rather, the big-name abstentions point to an underlying flaw with a tournament that can — and should — grow to become baseball’s answer to the soccer World Cup. And the source of that problem is the attitude of some American players, executives, fans and, yes, reporters. Any understanding of this dynamic begins with the acknowledgement that Team USA’s WBC performance has, to date, been quite poor: 7-7 with zero appearances in the title game. (Japan is the two-time defending champion, with wins over Cuba and South Korea.) So, it’s not as if we dominated the rest of the world and fell victim to a bad bounce or two in the medal round. We should want to reassert our supremacy in the sport, particularly when considering our all-time WBC record suggests precisely such a statement is needed. Instead, it seems several American stars see the WBC as a matter of convenience rather than an obligation to country and sport. They don’t want to play entering their walk year. They don’t want to play if they just changed teams, signed a big contract or went to the postseason. They will do it, only if the timing is exactly right. For just about every other participating nation, the opposite is true: Players offer an immediate “yes” unless they are injured. Miguel Cabrera and Pablo Sandoval were on the field in Detroit Oct. 28 for the final game of the 2012 World Series; they were the first players to commit for Team Venezuela. They will be joined by ace Felix Hernandez, who is as close to free agency as Kershaw and Verlander and has averaged close to 240 innings per season over the past four years. See which MLB stars earn the highest annual salaries, who's in the $150 million club and who makes the most at each position. Why do American players buy into the myth of increased injury risk more than players from other countries? Sure, there is inherent risk in the WBC. But no one has come up with hard evidence to suggest the tournament is any more dangerous than a spring-training game. Particularly for position players, one could argue that they are safer in the WBC, facing pitchers who are further along in their preseason throwing progression, as opposed to a live-armed 19-year-old called up from Class A to pitch in a big-league spring training game. And if a long-term injury does occur in WBC play, the player’s MLB club is insured at 100 percent for the salary he earns while on the disabled list. The rationalization du jour is the desire for a “regular spring-training preparation,” as Trout’s agent, Craig Landis, explained to the Los Angeles Times. That is a dubious explanation on two levels: In 2012, Trout had one of the best seasons in any of our lifetimes after health problems prevented him from “regular spring-training preparation.” Furthermore, any visitor to a major-league clubhouse in early- to mid-March — when the World Baseball Classic is held — will hear players grumbling that spring training is too long and they can’t wait to get the hell out of there. Nonetheless, with Trout & Co. on the sidelines, the lame excuse is there in case we need it: Oh, no one cares about the tournament because we don’t send all of our best players. Well, here’s a radical concept: How about we lend greater legitimacy and profile to the event by sending the best of our best, the way the other countries have, and then accept the results as they are? USA Basketball demanded a similar commitment from superstars like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant after the 2004 Olympic debacle. The result has been a 16-0 record and two gold medals. Our experts bring you all latest offseason news. Read MLB Buzz. A similar movement could take place in baseball, if a Jeter (or LeBron) figure emerges as the new Captain America and demands more of his countrymen. But it doesn’t appear that will happen in 2013. So the fans will probably take a cue from their idle heroes, following the WBC but not fully investing their emotions in it, because that’s easier on our egos, anyway. In the event of a defeat, we’d much rather complain about the timing of the event than acknowledge what that 7-7 record says: The world is catching up to us. The US remains the structural center of the baseball universe, producing more than 70 percent of current major-league players and serving as the base for 29 of its 30 teams. The game is richer, greater and more diverse than it’s ever been. Those are manifestly positive developments. Yet, because of how the history of our nation is intertwined with the history of the sport, the US bears a unique responsibility to grow the WBC as the sport’s premier international tournament. A large part of that obligation is showing up. And it would be nice to win once in a while, too.",Raw Data
16,"(CNN) -- Barcelona may be licking their wounds after a 2-0 European Champions League defeat to AC Milan but on Thursday they received a boost that star midfielder Xavi described as ""the best news of the year."" Eric Abidal, who has spent nearly a year out of the game after having a liver transplant, has been declared fit enough to rejoin Barca's first team squad. It is positive news for Barcelona whose manager Tito Vilanova is currently in New York receiving treatment for throat cancer. The French defender last played for Barca on February 26 last year and underwent surgery in April. He also had a tumor removed in March 2011. Abidal spent two months on a specific training program designed by club physio Emili Ricart before training with the rest of the squad from the middle of December. But now he is back in contention for a first team place. A statement on Barca's official website read: ""Following training Eric Abidal received the wonderful news that he is in good enough condition to play for the first team in what remains of the current season."" The club's players were delighted the 33-year-old had completed his recovery. Xavi, who has spent his entire career at the Spanish giants told the website: ""It's the best news of the year. ""It's not a great day coming back after a 2-0 defeat, but seeing Abidal, how he trains and gives it everything and that he's now able to return to playing is a source of motivation. It's the best news we could have had."" Club captain Carles Puyol took to social networking site Twitter to say: ""Today is the best news for Barcelonistas and football. Abidal has already been discharged. With him we are stronger."" Barca suffered just their second defeat in 22 matches when they went down 2-0 to Milan in the first leg at the San Siro. The club are striving for their fifth title in European football's most prestigious competition. The second leg at the Nou Camp is on March 12.",Raw Data
17,"LOS ANGELES — When the curtain and then the house lights came up Sunday night at Staples Center on Dwight Howard’s latest career chapter, the Lakers who were huddled together broke from their routine. Instead of the starters heading out together, they pulled back — letting Howard go it alone. Except nobody had told him. “They got me,” Howard said. The stunt, typically reserved for unsuspecting rookies, brought some levity and giggles to the occasion, with nobody laughing harder than Howard. That seemed to be the biggest takeaway from the debut of the Lakers’ latest in the line of franchise centers. If the Lakers’ grand experiment, pairing Howard and newly acquired Steve Nash with a rejuvenated Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace, results in a championship, Howard’s force of personality may give them a title LeBron James will probably never be able to deliver in Miami — that of the peoples’ champ. On a team defined by the hard edges set by Bryant (and the hard elbows of World Peace), Howard has the game and the personality to soften the imperialist air about the Lakers. If they've been an easy team to either love or hate, Howard can make them more likeable. Less haughty than nice. That much was apparent Sunday when Howard, who played his first game since undergoing back surgery last April, had 19 points, 12 rebounds, four blocks and five turnovers in the Lakers’ 99-92 loss to Sacramento. He looked on occasion stiff and unsteady and on others as dynamic and devastating as advertised, particularly diving to the basket on pick and rolls. But if Howard spent the night searching for his timing at both ends of the court, his comedic timing showed no sign of rust — or scars from that rather, um, awkward meeting with reporters as Stan Van Gundy was leaving. When Lakers coach Mike Brown stopped Howard on Sunday to fist-bump him before the game, whatever Howard said caused his coach to nearly double over with laughter. Howard amused himself — and others — during breaks in play, and seemed to play much of the night with a smile on his face. He found time afterward to poke fun at himself over Sacramento rookie Thomas Robinson — the center who thought he should have been drafted ahead of Anthony Davis — using him as a prop to dunk home a rebound. “Thomas Robinson did a little Nate Robinson impression — he pushed off my shoulder,” Howard said. “It’s going to be on 'SportsCenter' tonight.” Howard was taken aback when he emerged from the trainers’ room wearing a towel and headphones and saw about 25 media members camped at his locker. He said he had to get dressed before interviews started, otherwise “this is going to be on TMZ if I’m naked.” Bantering with some reporters while he was dressing, he quipped that it was OK to wait because ESPN was on all the time. And when a cameraman identified himself as being with Time Warner, which has not yet reached distribution deals with all cable providers to broadcast Lakers games, he joked about booing the network like fans do. He was cleared to play by long-time trainer Gary Vitti, whom Howard has taken to calling The Father. Howard said Vitti, er, Father told him: “Well son, you’ll be great. Father said go out there and play.” As for his back, it felt fine when he was knocked to the floor by Sacramento center DeMarcus Cousins because, he said, he was wearing not just his Iron Man suit but his Superman cape as well. Such bonhomie stands in contrast to the player Howard replaced, Andrew Bynum, the intelligent but increasingly incorrigible center. And if the Heat and the Lakers drive the narrative in the NBA this season, Howard would serve as a foil for James. Though both left small markets after years of trying in vain to carry them to a title, Howard’s personality will allow him to more easily cast aside the villain’s hat (at least outside Orlando) than James ever has a chance of doing. Winning a championship may have earned James a degree of redemption, and validated his standing as the best player in the NBA, but winning over the hearts of the sporting public will be a much taller task. Of course, winning a title is something Howard has not done, though he took Orlando to the Finals in 2009. And with a team that Bryant has already called the most talented he has ever had, Howard walks into circumstances in which he has more help than ever, but fewer excuses for falling short. This is a team that Brown believes can be great defensively, and one in which an offense driven by Nash will be plenty potent. While there were few quibbles with Howard on Sunday — he was late on several blocks — more will be expected of him than being a pick-and-roll force. “We’re going to challenge him to be more than just a screener, a roller, a dunker,” said Bryant, who believes that Howard — unlike another gregarious big man, Shaquille O’Neal — will be serious when it comes to work. “We want him to get the ball in the post, be a great, great passer off the post, to finish in the post — high and low. He has the talent to do that, there’s no reason why he shouldn’t do that. We’re going to challenge him to do that. He has the talent to make those plays. When teams play against us, we want them to say Dwight’s a dominant force offensively and defensively, but he’s one of the best passing big men in the league. That’s what we want him to be.” Those expectations, along with the events of the last year — the surgery and rehabilitation, the acrimonious goodbye from Orlando, and the uncertainty about coming to Los Angeles — all seemed to catch up with Howard as he waited to be introduced as a starter for the first time. “I actually shed a couple of tears tonight,” Howard said. “During the starting lineups, one of my teammates caught me, so I tried to hide it, but you know I was just excited. It is really emotional because I hadn’t been on a court in a while, and I just thank God that I came back as fast as I did. “It was a rough year, but you know what? There’s always a blessing in the storm. You always have moments in your life when you go through trials and tribulations, but what makes you better is how you come out.” Howard continued, speaking about the importance of optimism, of having a positive outlook. He did so with a smile on his face.",Raw Data
18,"Heads bowed, somber past and present Kansas City Chiefs players turned out Wednesday for a memorial service for teammate Jovan Belcher, who killed his girlfriend and then himself over the weekend. Belcher fatally shot 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins on Saturday at the Kansas City home they shared with their 3-month-old daughter, Zoey. He then drove to the Chiefs practice facility at Arrowhead Stadium, where coach Romeo Crennel, general manager Scott Pioli and defensive assistant Gary Gibbs witnessed Belcher commit suicide. The team moved up its practice schedule so that players could attend Wednesday afternoon's service at the nearby Landmark International Deliverance and Worship Center, where Belcher and Perkins worshipped. The media wasn't allowed inside. Afterward, a coffin was wheeled from the building and driven away in a hearse. Retired Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell said Pioli and an uncle of Belcher's spoke during the service. ''It's done and over with and people need to get on with their lives, and the team needed to try to get forward,'' Bell said. ''It's tough on them. When you see somebody and play with them you're buddies, friends.'' Many of the players boarded coach buses after the service, but a few walked to their own vehicles with their wives and girlfriends. ''It was good,'' running back Peyton Hillis said of the service. He wouldn't comment further. Defensive end Ropatisp Pitoitua, kicker Ryan Succop, and linebacker Derrick Johnson said they didn't want to be interviewed. Before the service, veteran offensive lineman Ryan Lilja said he hoped the memorial would provide some closure for the Chiefs, who will try to win their second straight game Sunday at Cleveland. ''You got to try to deal with it however you deal with it, and grieve the best way for the individual,'' he said, ''and I think this is the best way for us as a team to get closure and move on and focus on football.'' Lilja said some players have taken advantage of counseling services that have been provided by the Chiefs and the NFL and that there's been a change in the atmosphere around the team building. ''There definitely is more, `How you doing? How you feeling? How you coping?''' Lilja said. ''There's definitely more of that, and people leaning on each other, and be an ear when they need it. Guys are going to deal with this on an individual basis.'' Pastor Sylvarena Funderburke, who serves at Repairers of the Breach Christian Center in Kansas City, said she was at the service to sing ''I Won't Complain,'' a song the Belcher family requested. ''It is an honor. We don't always understand why things happen,'' she said before the service. ''That's when you have to rely on your faith and just trust God to give you strength to make it through tough times.'' Karen Young, who belongs to the Landmark church and serves as an usher, said Belcher and Perkins went to the church ''practically'' every week until the baby was born but hadn't been seen much since then. Larry Brown, who also attends the Landmark church, said Belcher was ''gentle'' and ''caring'' and Perkins ''a real nice person.'' ''I believed that they were made for each other,'' said Brown, whose brother is the church's leader, Bishop John L. Brown. ''They didn't appear to be the type of people who just put on facades. They were very happy. She was very genuine. Every time I saw them, they were always laughing.'' The barber shop where Belcher was a regular is in the same strip mall where the church is located. Barber Lee Garron walked over to the memorial service to pay his respects. ''He was a good person,'' Garron said. ''He was. He was like anyone else. You don't know what they are thinking or what is going on in their head. It's like you or me. You just never know.'' Belcher's Chiefs locker remained full of his equipment and personal belongings Wednesday as players quickly showered and dressed in suits for the service. Some said they avoided looking at the linebacker's locker, while others were fine with seeing their teammate's things as he left them. ''I don't have a problem seeing Jovan's locker over there,'' defensive back Travis Daniels said. He said it was important for the team to support the families of everyone involved. ''We're definitely thankful we have the opportunity to see them one last time before they go home and everything,'' Daniels said ahead of the service, referring to relatives who traveled from out of town to attend. ''We definitely want to go and pay respects to him and his family.''",Raw Data

20,"But after the win that should give the No. 2 Wolverines their first top ranking since the 1992-93 season, the sophomore guard wanted to talk defense and what a team does when one of its big, defensive rocks goes down. If you're Michigan (19-1, 6-1 Big Ten), you plug in a couple of other big guys. And you win — in this case 74-60 over the Illini, most of it without 6-foot-8, 250-pound Jordan Morgan. The starting forward limped to the locker room less than two minutes into the game with a sprained right ankle and didn't come back. ''Coach (John Beilein) calls him the minister of defense,'' Burke said, crediting the Mitch McGary, John Horford and Max Bielfeldt, the three big men who picked up the slack. ''I say this every game,'' Burke added, ''but it just starts with defense. I think that started in the first half.'' And that No. 1 ranking, which will likely be Michigan's after Duke's lopsided loss to Miami earlier in the week opened the door when the AP poll comes out Monday, doesn't mean much yet, Beilein was quick to remind. ''You compete for a Big Ten championship, then you go on you compete for a national championship,'' he said. ''That's the number one you want down the line.'' Illinois (15-6, 2-5) and first-year coach John Groce, whose team has been doomed by cold shooting since mid-December and shot 37.1 percent Sunday, could do little but marvel at the Wolverines. ''I give Michigan a lot of credit,'' Groce said. ''You make one mistake and they exploit it like that.'' Burke scored 19 to lead Michigan. Nick Stauskas scored 14 points and Glenn Robinson III and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 12 each. Brandon Paul led Illinois with 15 points but had five of the Illini's 15 costly turnovers. Beilein said he didn't yet know the severity of Morgan's sprained right ankle but said he couldn't have returned to the game even if baldy needed. The Wolverines hardly missed him; they seemed to have an answer for everything Illinois offered. The Illini fought back to within seven points with just over nine minutes to play when a D.J. Richardson steal set up Joseph Bertrand for a soft jump shot that floated into the bucket. The wave of noise that rose from the crowd trying to will the Illini back into the game didn't last long. First, with 8:40 to play, Mitch McGary pulled down the rebound off a miss by Burke and dropped the ball into the bucket. Then Burke scooped the ball up off a Paul turnover at the other end and, with a dunk, put the Wolverines back up by 11 at 59-48. With 8:21 to play and shooting just 37.1 percent on the night, Illinois couldn't find a way back. Morgan appeared to roll his right ankle as he came down under the Wolverine basket, but Michigan lost little if anything inside without the 6-foot-8, 250-pound forward. McGary, Bielfeldt — a redshirt freshman with strong ties to Illinois — and Horford picked up most of Morgan's minutes, and his slack. McGary, a 6-10, 250-pound forward, hasn't started a game this season but averages 16 minutes a night anyway. Bielfeldt, though, plays less than six minutes a night, and was all nerves in his first minutes on the court. The 6-7, 245-pound forward badly missed his first free throw, at least a foot right of the basket, and the crowd, well aware that the athletic administration building on the Illinois campus bears his big-donor family's name, let him have it. So did his teammates, Beilein said. ''It was not a great initial debut with the air ball. That's one of the first things we made fun of,'' the coach said. ''All his teammates were on him in the locker room.'' But with another chance at the line minutes later, Bielfeldt sank both shots, finishing with four points in six minutes. Horford had seven points and five boards in 17 minutes while McGary had six points and eight rebounds. ''It gave three guys the opportunity to play that (don't) get as much as they like, Beilein said of Morgan's injury. ''I'm really impressed with the big guys and how they stepped up there.'' Illinois' big-man combination of Nanna Egwu, Sam McLaurin and Tyler Griffey wasn't much of a match for them. The Wolverines scored 42 points in the paint. Groce said his big men weren't bad, just not as good they'd like to be, especially McLaurin, the 6-8 grad-student transfer he called his team's defensive Kevin Garnett ''I really have a high regard for Sam's intelligence and ability to execute our defense, and I think we'll look at the film and he wasn't on his P's and Q's like normal,'' said Groce, who last faced Michigan as the coach at Ohio, leading the Bobcats to a second-round NCAA Tournament upset last spring. Michigan took the lead for good with 15:21 to play in the first half when Burke hit a jump shot to go up 8-7. With a 9-0 run that ended only with a 3-pointer by Paul with 10:52 left in the half, the Wolverines were up 15-10.",Raw Data

Salary is often more directly linked to when a player becomes a free agent than actual career achievement. So, among all relievers in the game today, Soriano’s contract has the highest average annual value at $14 million. He moved ahead of Jonathan Papelbon's $12.5 million; Papelbon has enjoyed the better career but had the misfortune of becoming a free agent one year earlier. (Mariano Rivera’s last contract, at $15 million per year, still holds the reliever record.) See which MLB stars earn the highest annual salaries, who's in the $150 million club and who makes the most at each position. 3.

Of Soriano, Detroit club president/general manager Dave Dombrowski said, “We did not seriously pursue him, and (this news) does not change our bullpen situation.” Dombrowski said the reports on Rondon in the Venezuelan Winter League were “very good,” although his numbers were ordinary (4.41 ERA, 16 hits, six walks and 19 strikeouts in 16-1/3 innings). 8. The New York Yankees, who used to outbid teams for free agents they didn’t really need, have moved wholeheartedly into the draft-pick collection business. By losing Soriano to the Nationals, the Yankees have added a second compensatory pick after the first round. (Nick Swisher’s departure for Cleveland brought the first.) The Yankees are looking for a right-handed-hitting outfielder but remain mindful of the mythical $189 million cap for 2014. Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates. 9. Now that they’ve solidified the back end of their bullpen, the Nationals have a comprehensive 25-man roster. Of course, they could — and probably should — trade Mike Morse before Opening Day unless there’s a spring training injury. With Soriano, they have the flexibility to move Morse for the best package, period, rather than targeting a closer in return. Seattle still needs a bat and has interest. 10. Boras has two major free agents left, starter Kyle Lohse and outfielder Michael Bourn. Care to bet against him finding a good deal for each? The Rangers like Bourn, as long as the term is sufficiently short. Lohse would be an ideal fit for the Brewers, but they don’t seem to want to pay him. That’s OK. Someone will.",Raw Data
23,"LOS ANGELES Funny how quickly things can change. Last month, the world seemed to be closing in on UCLA basketball coach Ben Howland. To simplify things, media and fans wanted his head on a platter. The Bruins, with the second-best recruiting class in the nation, including two of the top three recruits in Shabazz Muhammad and Kyle Anderson, had just lost their third non-conference game. They finally were playing at full strength Muhammad missed UCLAs first three games after the NCAA declared him ineligible for receiving improper benefits during recruiting visits yet still, one of the nations most talented teams blew an 18-point lead and lost to lowly Cal Poly. Two players quit the team in a week. Coming on the heels of last seasons Sports Illustrated story that painted UCLA as a program that had gone off the rails and adding to Howlands reputation as a man with rather sharp edges, it seemed like the coachs decade at UCLA which included three Final Fours in a row was grinding to a halt. Not a peep of that sort is being heard around Westwood these days. All Howland had to do is win. We hear it all. Its hard to deal with, but you cant think of it, said high-scoring guard Jordan Adams, another of UCLAs highly rated recruiting class. The last couple years (UCLA) hasnt been all that great. Us coming in this year and trying to change all that, of course were going to hear it. Tweets. Media. Everything. All that calms down a bit when you win, though. Doesnt it? And as soon as we lose, its back to the same thing again, Adams said. We try to stay away from that kind of stuff. It can bring you down. Just as winning can bring you up. Since the Bruins Dec. 1 loss to San Diego State dropped Howlands team to a disappointing 5-3, the Bruins havent lost a game. UCLA has 10 wins in a row heading into Saturdays contest against 21st-ranked Oregon. After missing the NCAA tournament last season and veering toward a perceived train wreck this season, Howlands young men are back on track. Apparently, all they needed was a little bit of tough love from their grouchy father figure. I cant control that, Howland said of the outside rumblings to have him canned. I just work to do what I can control, which is my effort, my staff and how hard we work at our job and help our kids improve and get better. We have a very young team. We had a shaky start. Really, we had one bad loss. The other two losses we had were to top-25 teams. Sometimes youre dealing with people who are coming after you, trying to stir things up, and I cant control that. Coaching often is described as a form of teaching. But a more apt analogy might be something closer to parenting. A college basketball coachs job is to nurture his players. Sometimes nurturing means building up a players confidence. Sometimes nurturing means lighting a fire under the rear end of a huge talent. A coach must make the lesser talents play better than they ever thought they could, and the greatest talents learn to play as a team instead of as five separate units. What Howland has done so far with this extraordinarily talented group of UCLA players has been something uniquely suited to his rather prickly personality. He used that old parental trick of tough love. With tough love, he got these young men to buy in. Perhaps its no coincidence that six of the stars on this UCLA team Muhammad, Adams, Anderson, Larry Drew II and Travis and David Wear were coached by their fathers in high school. You cant deny the results. Not just the three Final Fours in a row, not just Howlands role in developing NBA stars like Russell Westbrook and Kevin Love, but more crucially this seasons team. After a rough beginning, in the past month UCLA has played a looser brand of basketball; several of the players even brag about attending yoga classes. Muhammad started slowly but dropped 27 points on then-seventh-ranked Missouri in late December and is now averaging more than 18 points. Fellow freshman Adams is shooting the lights out, netting more than 16 points a game. Senior point guard Drew ranks second nationally in assists and, more importantly, first in assist-to-turnover ratio, with an astounding rate of nearly five assists to each turnover. Its just about jelling more as a team, Muhammad said. If you look at it back with Cal Poly and Georgetown, everybody wasnt on the same page. We were just playing pickup. Now we just know each others games and know what were going to do on offense and defense. Our team chemistry is getting to where we want it to be. Where this team wants to be is back in the Final Four. As for Muhammad? Howland has had to kick him out of the gym recently. Muhammad, who has lost some 10 pounds in a recent conditioning drive, has been working too hard, shooting late at night, lifting weights after 2-hour practices. Its that sort of drive, Howland said, that turns a great raw talent into a great player. And thats what Muhammad says he wants to be. He doesnt just want to be the best freshman in college basketball this year. He says he wants to be the best player. And he wants UCLA, the team we all wrote off last month, to be the best in college basketball come March.",Raw Data

Ridden for the first time by Elvis Trujillo, Itsmyluckyday won by two lengths, finishing in 1 minute, 41.81 seconds and paying $11.40 for a $2 win bet in the Grade 3 Kentucky Derby prep race. ''I'm not going to say he's the best 3-year-old; I'm going to say he was the best 3-year-old here today,'' said trainer Eddie Plesa Jr., whose horse started from the seventh post position. ''Words can't describe it. It's something everybody should feel. Anybody in this game deserves to have this feeling. I wish them all to have this feeling sometime . . . just not today.''

He set the pace in the backstretch until being challenged nearing the quarter pole. That's where Itsmyluckyday went to the leader's outside, shook free at the eighth pole and drew clear in the final sixteenth. ''This was a very fast trip with two horses out in front and us right behind,'' Trujillo said. ''This was the trip Mr. Plesa and I hoped for.'' Itsmyluckyday, who also won the Gulfstream Park Derby by six lengths on New Year's Day, figures to be one of the favorites for the Grade 1 Florida Derby on March 30. Plesa was noncommittal about that race until seeing how the horse came out of the Holy Bull. ''He's going to tell me what he wants to do,'' Plesa said. ''It's a 3-year-old -- everybody's excited because of the Kentucky Derby. It's hard not to get wrapped up in that.'' Plesa has trained one Kentucky Derby horse, filly Three Ring in 1999. The victory was Itsmyluckday's fifth in nine career starts. He raced at Monmouth Park, Calder and Delta Downs last year.

25,"TIME TO WORRY: At 1-4 after loss to Kings, Coyotes have reason to worry, must find answers before it's too late. The Phoenix Coyotes' stunning success last season included their first appearance in the Western Conference finals, and that came at the expense of the Nashville Predators. Neither team has played at that level since returning from the lockout, and now the Predators are without Patric Hornqvist. In their first meeting since facing off in the playoffs, the Coyotes and Predators are both looking for just their second win in six games this season Monday night. Phoenix (1-4-0) won a division title for the first time in franchise history last season, ousting Chicago and then Nashville before falling to eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles in the conference finals. The Coyotes eliminated the Predators in five games, winning three times at home. A rematch in this year's postseason seems unlikely at the moment. The Coyotes allowed at least four goals for the fourth time in five games Saturday, losing 4-2 to the visiting Kings. The Predators (1-1-3) are doing a little better, although they lost their third shootout Saturday in a 3-2 defeat at Anaheim. They also may have suffered a major blow when Hornqvist exited in the third period with a lower-body injury. Hornqvist, tied for the team lead with four points after pacing the Predators with 27 goals last season, is out indefinitely. ""He's one of those great guys that brings a lot of energy, and he's about as hard as they come,"" coach Barry Trotz said. ""It's a little frustrating because we haven't won a shootout, but we're getting points in every game, and you have to collect points, especially on the road."" Nashville hasn't had a problem doing that at Phoenix during the regular season with three straight victories, most recently a 5-4 shootout win March 12. But they came up empty in Arizona in the playoffs, with Pekka Rinne yielding 11 goals in the three losses. Rinne, 0-1-3 with a 2.36 goals-against average this season, could get another chance at his first win Monday after making 20 saves and giving up the lone shootout goal against the Ducks. Although he skated Sunday, counterpart Mike Smith seems like he may miss a third straight game with a lower-body injury he suffered early in Wednesday's 5-1 win over Columbus. He was one of Phoenix's stars in the playoffs, posting a 1.73 GAA and a shutout in the series with Nashville. Phoenix has lost both games without Smith, as Jason LaBarbera has given up eight goals on 65 shots. The backup has won three of his last four meetings with the Predators behind a 1.76 GAA. The Coyotes have allowed 20 goals through five games after yielding 2.37 per contest last season. ""When there is a mistake you've got to clean up for each other,"" coach Dave Tippett said. ""Right now, there's not much cleaning up going on."" Shane Doan, who scored his second goal of the season Saturday, will try to build on his recent success against the Predators. Including the playoffs, he has 15 points in his past 17 meetings with Nashville, getting nine in as many games at home. Steve Sullivan leads the Coyotes with four goals, and he's facing the Predators for just the second time since spending five-plus seasons with them. He had an assist for Pittsburgh in a home victory March 22.",Raw Data
26,"Host South Africa twice came from behind to draw with Morocco 2-2 on Sunday and advance to the quarterfinals of the African Cup of Nations after finishing top of Group A. The result meant that Cape Verde also reached the quarterfinals in its first major tournament after beating Angola 2-1 in a game that took place simultaneously in Port Elizabeth. Morocco finished third in the group. Goals from Issam El Adoua and substitute Abdelilah Hafidi appeared to have put Morocco through for the first time since 2004. But on both occasions South Africa fought back, with May Mahlangu and Siyabonga Sangweni ensuring the hosts topped their group on goal difference. Defender Sangweni, who scored in South Africa's 2-0 win over Angola, again made a crucial contribution as his 87th-minute goal kept Bafana Bafana in the tournament. ''If you know there are only a few minutes left I think you throw everything you have forward. He's obviously gone up and taken a chance and it's paid off,'' South Africa captain Bongani Khumalo said. ''It gets tougher now. We're at that sensitive part of the competition and we need to believe in each other and work even harder.'' Morocco attacked from the start with Youssef El Arabi testing South Africa goalkeeper Intumeleng Khune in the fourth. Morocco took the lead just six minutes later when El Adoua beat Khune to a corner to nod home. South Africa continued to struggle in the first half with Khune forced to make vital saves to deny Chahir Belghazouani and Kamel Chafni before the break. The hosts had a couple of unconvincing penalty appeals, and Bernard Parker's shot flashed wide of Morocco's goal. South Africa replaced striker Katlego Mphela with Ajax playmaker Thulani Serero early in the second half and Morocco coach Rachid Taoussi looked to shut up shop as he made two defensive substitutions by the 63rd minute. The decision came back to haunt Taoussi eight minutes later, when Mahlangu found space on the edge of the penalty area to curl his shot into the top-right hand corner. Find out who impressed in the second round of the group stage in the African Cup of Nations, and who fell short. With Angola leading 1-0 at the time, Morocco needed another goal to progress and they found it when the ball dropped to Hafidi 12 yards from South Africa's goal and the substitute fired through several players. However, knowing that defeat would mean an exit in the event of a Cape Verde victory, South Africa pushed forward and equalized again when Sangweni mirrored Mahlangu's goal from the edge of the area. With news of Cape Verde's victory coming through, Morocco threw everything forward in the hope of a late winner, but South Africa held on to leave several Moroccan players in tears as celebrations started in the stands of the Moses Mabhida Stadium. ''It's a great occasion now for the team, for myself and especially for the South African people,'' South Africa coach Gordon Igesund said. ''It was very important for us to qualify (for the second round), hosting this tournament, and I think we've made the country proud. ''I wasn't happy in the first half, because the first goal they scored was a free header, which shouldn't happen at this level. We got a beautiful goal to come back, and then once we were level we went back into defense and they scored their second goal. We had to dig really deep for the result today.''",Raw Data

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. His TKO victory of Michael Bisping in the second round of UFC on FX 7 on Saturday centrally made the Brazilian middleweight relevant again, so much so he wants to move up a weight class and take on Jon Jones at April’s UFC 159 — a fight where Chael Sonnen will challenge for the light heavyweight crown. “I want to get that belt,” said Beflort, a former UFC champ who lost to Jones via a submission in September. “Take that punk, Chael Sonnen, I don’t even know your name, and get out. (UFC president) Dana (White) and (UFC co-owner) Lorenzo (Fertitta), kick him out. I want to fight Jon Jones. Take that clown away. Go home. Let me fight the champ. Champ vs. champ.” Jon Jones. Chael Sonnen. What more could you want? New episodes Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on FX. Belfort looked much more impressive against Bisping, who — unlike Belfort — would have gotten a shot at the middleweight titleholder Anderson Silva with a victory. Belfort first stunned the boisterous Bisping late in the first round with a kick. While time ran out before he could follow it up in the first, he unleashed a left kick to Bisping’s temple early in the second. The shot dropped Bisping and Belfort followed with a series of fists before the referee stopped the fight a minute, 27 seconds into the second round. “You win some. You lose some,” Bisping said. “I am not going away. Trust me.” The KO earned Belfort the $50,000 “Knockout of the Night” bonus and his post-fight comments earned him the ire of Sonnen. “Let me be really, really clear and speak directly to you, Vitor,” said Sonnen, a Fuel TV analyst. “You’re telling the world that you want to meet Jesus and I will gladly arrange that travel. First, I’m going to get rid of Jon Jones. “Let me be clear: I accept. You called me out twice now.” In the opening fight on FX, Khabib Nurmagomedov made UFC fans (and UFC bloggers who didn’t want to have to type his name multiple times) very happy when he made short work of Thiago Tavares. Nurmagomedov caught Tavares with a deft punch, leveling the Brazilian to the canvas. He then pounced with a series of vicious elbows, forcing the fight to be stopped inside of two minutes of the first round. The Brazilian crowd received a boon in the second bout when their countryman Gabriel Gonzaga kept the action rolling, defeating Ben Rothwell in two rounds. Gonzaga showed great versatility for a heavyweight, controlling the striking game and pressuring Rothwell with a series of takedowns. Gonzaga outworked Rothwell, to the delight of the crowd, sinking in a guillotine choke for the finish. And Daniel Sarafian, who had to miss the finale of TUF Brazil due to injury, entered the Octagon and put on a showcase with fellow middleweight C.B. Dollaway that earned ""Fight of the Night"" honors. With the entire country firmly in his corner, Sarafian came out blazing, delivering combinations and a wicked overhand right that rocked Dollaway early and often. It wasn’t until the middle of round two that Dollaway turned the tides, implementing a counter right that opened up his grappling game. With the fight spending more time on the ground, Dollaway dealt damage to Sarafian diminishing his stamina. This led to a gutsy third round where the fighters constantly flopped dominant position, leaving the judges in a quandary. In the end, the judges sided with Dollaway in a split decision that caused some of the loudest booing ever to drown out a post-fight interview.

29,"The mercurial, high-scoring forward with defensive intensity to spare opened 2012 by leading her Istanbul-based European club , Fenerbahce, to the Turkish League title for the second straight season, before bursting onto the Olympic scene in London, where she helped the U.S. Womens National Team win an unprecedented fifth straight team gold medal. Along the way, McCoughtry also managed to lead the WNBA in scoring despite a drama-filled season with the Atlanta Dream. McCoughtry is averaging team highs in both scoring (15.3 ppg) and rebounds (6.3 rpg) for Fenerbahce, which currently sits undefeated atop the Turkish League with a 12-0 record, including a big win over fellow Istanbul-based sporting rival Galatasary, which sports fellow WNBAers Lindsay Whalen, Sylvia Fowles, Sancho Lyttle and Ann Wauters . Additionally, McCoughtry and Fenerbache are 5-2 in Group B of the prestigious EuroLeague. Angel McCoughtry/FIBA/Europe. Now in her third season in Istanbul, McCoughtry credits her familiarity with and fondness for the city as a big factor in her success on the court. I feel really great here in Istanbul. Its a great city. I love the culture. The food is great, the nightlife is terrific and most importantly, Im loving the basketball, said the Baltimore native. Istanbul is so killer. In some ways, its a lot like New York City. The fast-paced vibe, the thriving business, the traffic. But its also very historic and has a great history. The on-the-court atmosphere in the Turkish League sometimes reminds the fiery University of Louisville alum of the collegiate game back home in the U.S. You can tell the people here really love the sport. Every game the intensity in the crowd is like going to a Duke home game, times three, said McCoughtry, who led Louisville the National Championship game in 2009, where they fell to Maya Moore, Geno Auriemma and UConn in the title game. Its definitely different playing here, but who doesnt want to play in front of high-energy, excited fans for every game? To hear fans chanting your name in another language is a special feeling. McCoughtry is partnered by New York Liberty guard Cappie Pondexter with Fenerbahce this season and is loving every minute of it. Istanbul is so killer. In some ways, its a lot like New York City. The fast-paced vibe, the thriving business, the traffic. But its also very historic and has a great history. -- Angel McCoughtry ""I really enjoy playing with Cappie. She has a great knack for knowing the strengths of her teammates, where they like to get the ball, and which plays work with which players,"" said McCoughtry. ""Cappie makes sure that she is aware of her teammates needs and does what she can to make everyone involved, which helps the team as a whole. Id love to have her with me at Atlanta, but I know shes doing her thing in New York City, trying to win a championship there, like I am in Atlanta."" Pondexter, averaging 12.5 points and 3.8 assists per game for Fenerbahce, is happy to be teaming up with McCoughtry in European ball. Angel is a great teammate. Shes a never-say-die competitor and it doesnt hurt that the girl can jump out of the gym, said Pondexter, who is looking forward to teaming up with new Liberty head coach Bill Laimbeer for the 2013 WNBA season. Its a pleasure playing with Angel, a real treat. One of the primary benefits of competing in Europe during the WNBA off-season is the opportunity to compete in more than one competition. Fans of WNBA players competing abroad, however, may find themselves with a case of ""league fatigue"" when faced with the different leagues featuring their favorite WNBA stars. Here's a quick explanation. Most WNBAers are playing for teams that compete in the domestic league of the country they are playing in. So, McCoughtry and Pondexter are in the Turkish League. The European teams, however, are ALSO competing in a larger, and in many respects more competitive and more prestigious league called the EuroLeague, which pits the top domestic teams from individual countries (ie. Fenerbahce in Turkey) in a European wide tournament. College basketball fans can think of it like Brittney Griner and Baylor University compete in the Big 12 where they face conference foes in pursuit of a conference championship. Additionally, Griner and Baylor will appear in the NCAA tournament, where the top teams in each conference are matched up in tournament crowning the best of the best as the National Champion. The domestic European leagues are akin to the conferences, while the EuroLeague is similar to the NCAA Tournament, including a Final Four. While McCoughtry is intent on holding off Whalen and Fowles and Company with Galatasary for the 2013 Turkish League title, she also has an eye on a strong EuroLeague run, where she may bump into Diana Taurasi and Candace Parker with UMMC (Russia) among other top European teams. Our domestic Turkish League is tough and exciting, but the Euro League, youre talking at another level because you have the best teams in Europe, and most of the best players in the world, all competing in that one competition. Its a great test of your talent, said McCoughtry, who helped Fenerbahce reach the Final Eight of the EuroLeague in 2011. It is different, playing a team from Poland or Russia, you may not know how they play, what type of game they play, but Im not really big on stats and scoring averages and that type of thing anyway, so I dont worry about that. Ill focus on whichever team we face that week, get the info from the coaches on how to go after the opponent right in front of me, and then go from there. The thing about the USA team is you have all these great players, but since you are all together and you have that common goal of winning the gold, you are all so hungry for it. To get it done. -- Angel McCoughtry Its no wonder McCoughtry is excited about competing among the worlds elite, after firmly establishing her personal bonafides in the London 2012 Olympics. Despite averaging just 14.9 minutes per game under Auriemma with Team USA, McCoughtry led the womens basketball tournament in steals with 20. And numbers didnt tell the whole story, as McCoughtrys raw energy and enthusiasm off the bench was for many the talk of the tournament. London was just a tremendous, satisfying experience. Everything about it. Winning that gold medal was fantastic, of course. To be a part of that was something I will never, ever forget. I was so happy to get the opportunity to get on that team and play with those players and show my peers and the world what I can do, said McCoughtry, who also led the tournament in field goal percentage (.620). It was great having people come up to me, Wow, Angel, you were off the hook. The thing about the USA team is you have all these great players, but since you are all together and you have that common goal of winning the gold, you are all so hungry for it. To get it done. And I think that helped me get to another level and I was very happy with how I played and to bring home the gold for our country. It was the best experience of my life. An absolute blessing. However, it wasnt all blessings and accolades in 2012 for McCoughtry. Upon her return to the U.S. and the second half of the WNBA season, McCoughtry found herself in a maelstrom of controversy as the Dream parted ways with Head Coach Marynell Meadors, who had combined with McCoughtry to lead Atlanta to two-straight WNBA Finals appearances in 2010 and 2011. ""I just had the best experience of my life and then I get to Atlanta, and it just felt like I got blamed for everything,"" said McCoughtry, who served a two-game suspension before returning to play for then interim and fulltime Head Coach Fred Williams.  ""I had nothing to do with the coaching change. Im not the person who decides who coaches or not. I was painted as the bad guy, and I wont lie, that hurt. I got depressed and felt all this pressure. It went from the ultimate high of London and then the all-time low of being made out to look bad for something I didnt do. It was a learning experience. Trust me and believe. Its coming. Real soon. I will win a WNBA Championship."" -- Angel McCoughtry McCoughtry looked to her counterparts in the NBA for inspiration when things got tough. ""For the first time, I understood a little bit what LeBron and Kobe had to deal with, said McCoughtry, who recently got some positive headlines after donating $15,000 to fund educational and learning supplies for youth via the Louisville Out-of-School Time Coordinating Council. But Kobe persevered and came back even stronger."" McCoughtry paused a moment before completing her thought and stated her clear intentions for the 2013 WNBA season. ""Trust me and believe, Angel is coming back strong too,"" said McCoughtry. ""Trust me and believe. Its coming. Real soon. I will win a WNBA Championship. Mentally, after this experience, Im stronger than ever. And physically, Im 26-years-old, hitting my prime, and I am ready to go. Trust me and believe. Its coming.""",Raw Data
30,"﻿ Now that we’re done with the NBA All-Star Game and Kobe Bryant exerting his every fiber to prove some meaningless point in a meaningless game against LeBron James, we can get back to the regular season’s home stretch and the one glaring fact that will shape every bit of it. The Miami Heat are the one dominant team towering above everyone else. The rest of the would-be contenders are going to have to spend the remaining part of the regular season adapting and preparing for that fact. The Heat don’t have the league’s best record, but in LeBron they have the league’s best player playing the best ball of his career. Chris Bosh has been extraordinary during the Heat’s current seven-game winning streak, as well, and Dwyane Wade has looked every bit a part of the Big Three. This is not a team, right now, that anyone is likely to beat in a seven-game series. In fact, they’re so in sync, their beatdown of the Oklahoma City Thunder before the break marked their sixth straight win against the best team in the West. It also was proof that Kevin Durant, Russell Westbook and Co. need to find another level if they hope to have any chance at a successful Finals reunion against Miami. Life without James Harden is what it is, and they’re going to have to adjust to it. There are more needs nagging the other Western Conference foes if they hope to get to the Finals and, presumably, beat Miami. The San Antonio Spurs need to stay healthy and find a way to match up against younger teams with fresher legs. One of those teams, the Los Angeles Clippers, has just gotten its starting lineup back — Chauncey Billups, in particular, has been a nice catalyst set next to Chris Paul — but they feel slightly inadequate as constituted. Check out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo. Blake Griffin’s mediocre free-throw shooting offers teams a way to stop his explosive play. Add in DeAndre Jordan’s abysmal free-throw shooting and the rest of his fourth-quarter handicaps, and it’s clear why rumors persist that the Clippers might be consider something like a Jordan-and-Eric Bledsoe-for-Kevin Garnett trade. Memphis is good, but it no longer has Rudy Gay, a shot-creator and star who can wade through the heavy pressures of the playoffs and offer up buckets when everyone else is locked down by a first-team defense or the moment. That’s a need that doesn’t always register on the analytics pages, but the fact remains: The playoffs are very often about stars rising to a level that normal players cannot. Golden State, as well, is a very good team not ready for a real run, and the Lakers are just hoping to avoid disgrace by getting into the playoffs. Out East, there’s little reason to worry. The Heat are the giants and few teams can really match them over seven games. For the Knicks, they’d need to get more from Amar’e Stoudemire over an entire, grueling series, and their huge reliance on 3-point shots (a league-high 33 percent of their attempts are from long range) and their so-so defense (15th in the league) highlight too many faults. When you’re talking about taking on LeBron James while he’s playing so well people can’t say his name without mentioning Michael Jordan’s, well, good luck. Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. The Bulls are an intriguing question mark. They’ve become a fine unit that fights together and executes the vision of their tough, defensive-minded head coach. If Derrick Rose somehow returns at full or nearly full health, they could become an immediate contender. But Rose has wisely made it clear he won’t rush it, and the past has shown us that the Heat know how to handle the skills of the youngest MVP in league history. The team with the best chance might be the Indiana Pacers. Paul George has emerged as a star, but just as important he can match up on LeBron defensively. He’s 6-foot-8, he’s young, he’s athletic, and he’s a focal point of a Pacers defense that ranks among the top teams in the league in defensive rating (1st), shooting defense (1st), blocks and steals per game (3rd) and rebounding (4th). Danny Granger will return from injury this month, and if he injects the team with depth and help — rather than disrupts their culture and chemistry — and the Pacers learn from last year’s playoff letdown against Miami, they could be dangerous even to the Heat. But the fact remains: All the Heat have to do to remain the huge favorites is to simply keep doing what they’ve been doing.

31,"Kane scored 1:59 into overtime, tapping in a rebound from Olli Jokinen's long shot, to give Winnipeg a 5-4 victory Sunday after trailing the New York Islanders by two with eight minutes left. ''I knew Olli had (the puck) and there was nobody in my way and I was actually looking for the breakaway, but Olli kept it,'' said Kane, who also had an assist. ''I knew he would shoot it when I saw the big windup. ''He has a really hard shot.'' Goals 65 seconds apart by Dustin Byfuglien and Alexander Burmistrov set up the extra period for Winnipeg. Alexei Ponikarovsky and Bryan Little also scored. Kane thought Jokinen would bury the shot behind Islanders goalie Evgeni Nabokov, but the puck rolled along the goal line and he poked it over. The goal was reviewed, but Kane had no doubt it counted. ''It was just like watching a football game. It just has to break the plane,'' he said. The Jets have won three games in a row. John Tavares had a goal and two assists for the Islanders. David Ullstrom, Matt Moulson and Mark Streit also scored for New York. Frans Nielsen had a pair of assists. Islanders coach Jack Capuano knew the Jets weren't out of it. Winnipeg went down 2-0 in the first period against the Penguins Friday and pulled out a 4-2 win. ''After watching the Pittsburgh game, we knew they were going to come,'' Capuano said. ''They got good speed, they got really good transition with their (defense), and they beat us up the ice in the first period. ''We could have been down a lot more than a goal. '' Byfuglien's goal on the power play at 12:59 of the third period marked the first time this season the Islanders had allowed a power-play goal in 17 shorthanded situations. Burmistrov's tied the game 4-4 in front of a sellout of 15,004 at MTS Centre. ''No, it wasn't a Picasso, that's for sure,'' Jets coach Claude Noel said. ''But, you know, you're going to have those nights and I think what you have to do is you kind of have to try to get a grip on things. ''It wasn't ideally what we would have liked, but I did like that we had some time left in the game and we didn't sit and dwell on the negative and sit and beat ourselves up.'' Jets backup goalie Al Montoya got his first start of the season against his former team and stopped 21 shots. He signed as a free agent with Winnipeg last July. He played two seasons with the Islanders, but got into only 31 games last season because of a concussion suffered after a December hit by Kane. Nabokov stopped 30. A turnover by the Jets led to New York's first goal, a wrist shot Ullstrom put past Montoya at 2:34 of the opening period. Ullstrom is on a four-game points streak with two goals and a pair of assists. Winnipeg tied it up eight minutes later when Kyle Wellwood sent a pass across the front of the net to Ponikarovsky for his first goal with the Jets. Little gave the Jets a 2-1 lead at 5:13 of the second period when he took a pass in front of the net from Nik Antropov and shot the puck under the stick of Nabokov. Tavares went on a breakaway 22 seconds into the third period and tallied his first goal of the season with a high shot past Montoya to make it 2-2. Tavares got his assist when his long shot was redirected by Moulson for a 3-2 lead at 5:09. Streit made it 4-2 with a power-play marker at 9:53.",Raw Data
32,"Eden Hazard is facing an extended ban for kicking out at a ball boy after the Football Association charged him over his sending-off in Chelsea's Capital One Cup exit at Swansea. Belgian playmaker Hazard was already set to serve an automatic three-match suspension for his red card in Wednesday night's semi-final second leg at the Liberty Stadium. But the FA deemed that ""insufficient"" punishment for the offense, prompting an additional charge Friday afternoon. An FA statement read: ""The FA has charged Chelsea's Eden Hazard following his side's League Cup semi-final at Swansea on January 23, 2013. ""It is alleged that Hazard's behaviour in relation to a Swansea ball boy, for which the player was dismissed in the 78th minute, constituted violent conduct whereby the standard punishment that would otherwise apply was clearly insufficient. The player has until 6pm on Tuesday, January 29, 2013 to respond to the charge. The FA will remind all clubs of their responsibilities in ensuring ball boys and other personnel around the pitch act in an appropriate manner at all times and will liaise with competitions accordingly."" Hazard was also the subject of a police probe over the incident, which saw him dismissed by referee Chris Foy in the closing stages of Wednesday night's game. The Belgian lost patience when Swansea ball boy Charlie Morgan refused to hand over the ball after it had gone out for a goal kick. Morgan fell to the ground as Hazard attempted to get the ball from him, with the 22-year-old then kicking it from under him. Morgan reacted as if he had been caught in the ribs and although the 17-year-old insisted he had no intention of pressing charges, South Wales Police have been obliged to continue investigating after receiving three complaints. ""Three calls have been received from members of the public living in Sussex, Kent and west Wales which are being followed up,"" a police spokesman said. Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins hit out at continued police involvement, telling Sky Sports News: ""On a personal note, I find it remarkable that there is any thought of police action. Things are done in the heat of the moment and probably everybody looks back and wishes things had been done differently. We accept how things are and all move forward."" ""That would be my personal feeling, but I can't control what others are going to do. Speaking on behalf of the club, it's something we'd quickly like to forget."" Chelsea boss Rafael Benitez refused to be drawn on any aspect of the ball-boy saga or its implications. The Spaniard deployed the same bizarre evasion tactics used in a press conference earlier this week, saying: ""We have two windows: one for football and one for the other issues."" He said Hazard had trained ""normally"" since the incident and that any disciplinary action taken against him by the club was an internal matter. After repeated probing, Chelsea's head of communications eventually intervened, saying: ""The club, on the evening, recognised the seriousness of the incident. The player recognised that he was wrong to react in that way. The appropriate apologies were made, and the club made every effort to make those happen. Rafa dealt with it accordingly in the press conference, too.""",Raw Data

The Spanish tennis federation said Saturday that Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, ranked 85th, will take Almagro's place in his debut for Spain's national team. Media reports said Almagro, who reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, has a leg injury. Garcia-Lopez joins fellow newcomer Albert Ramos and doubles team Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez for the series in Vancouver on Feb. 1-3. This means the five-time champions will be without their top three players, with Rafael Nadal injured and David Ferrer sitting out the round.

34,"﻿ As Evan Gordon held the ball loosely at the ASU end as the clock ran out, UCLA guard Jordan Adams knocked the ball loose and dribbled the other way for a meaningless basket. Carrick Felix decided that would not stand. Felix chased Adams down and blocked his attempted layup with two seconds remaining. STAT OF THE GAME 83 – minutes Evan Gordon and Carrick Felix have played in the last two games. Gordon went the full 45 in the overtime victory over USC on Thursday. Felix missed one minute against both USC and UCLA TAKEAWAYS • Jon Gilling had 20 points, 23 rebounds and 14 assists against the Los Angeles schools. Whereas he impacted the game primarily as a scorer last year, he does not have to score to be an integral piece this season • Familiarity breeds 16-4 – ASU has started the same five in all 20 games this season • The Sun Devils, 5-2 in conference play, will have a winning record at the mid-way point for the fourth time in 18 years regardless of what happens next weekend on their trip to the Washington schools. • Chris Colvin missed his third straight game while under suspension for an unspecified violation of team rules, but he could return for the Washington trip next weekend Bruce Yeung/Yeung Photography ASU takes down UCLA to earn sweep of L.A. schools. VIEW GALLERY >> Bruce Yeung/Yeung Photography There's been plenty to cheer about on the court this season for the ASU Spirit Squad. VIEW GALLERY >> TEMPE, Ariz. – Arizona State trumped UCLA's statement victory in Tucson on Thursday with a statement weekend of its own. If it wasn't obvious already, there is a new contender in the muscled-up Pac-12, and the Sun Devils supplied more evidence with a convincing 78-60 victory over UCLA at Wells Fargo Arena on Saturday afternoon, its most significant victory since the days of James Harden. Jordan Bachynski dominated the paint against the smaller, less-physical Bruins, Carrick Felix had another double-double and Jahii Carson effectively ran the show as Arizona State (16-4, 5-2) followed its overtime victory against USC on Thursday by handling UCLA (16-5, 6-2) its worst loss of the season, two days after the Bruins outplayed No. 6 Arizona. ASU's 17-point loss to Arizona the previous Saturday, a two-point game until Carson committed his fourth foul midway through the second half, appeared to supply motivation for the USC/UCLA series, which Carson earlier in the week called a ""must sweep."" ""We never gave up. Our heads never dropped. We knew when we lost to the U of A, we had to come out here and get a must-win sweep against these L.A. teams,"" Carson said. ""We knew a sweep would give other teams in our conference an alert and put their antennas up that we are not going away so fast. Our confidence is high now. I think we're ready. I think our antennas are back up. I think our confidence is back up, and I think we are ready to go out there and win some more games."" No. 16 Oregon leads the Pac-12, but Arizona State joined Arizona and UCLA as two-loss teams entering the final series of the first half next weekend. Bachynski had career highs with 22 points and 15 rebounds, eight on the offensive end, throwing his weight around against a Bruins team that seemed leery of contact. ASU had a 53-33 rebounding edge, its greatest margin in coach Herb Sendek's seven seasons here, and had 13 second-chance points. ASU had a 46-26 edge on points in the paint. Sendek took Bachynski out 3 ½ minutes into the game and had a short conversation, and when Bachynski returned five minutes later, he was a new man. He scored eight of the Sun Devils' next 10 points on shots around the rim, and his pick-and-roll layup off a Felix feed gave ASU a 22-19 lead, a lead it never lost. ""We needed more out of me,"" Bachynski said. ""I knew I needed to step up. So I reset mentally and went back out."" Bachynski's short shot in the lane 90 seconds into the second half gave ASU a 43-33 lead, and UCLA never found a comeback, getting as close as nine points only three times thereafter. Bachynski also had six blocked shots and the Sun Devils held UCLA to 34.7 percent shooting from the field. ""You got to learn. Now he (Bachynski) has blocked two or three shots and we kept trying to test him and he kept blocking them. He's second in the country in blocked shots. He's a really good player. I told our guys last night in our scouting report he is going to make a lot of money playing basketball,"" UCLA coach Ben Howland said. Freshmen Jordan Adams (19 points) and Shabazz Muhammad (18) led UCLA in scoring, but the Bruins did not have many other weapons. Forward Travis Wear, averaging 14.4 points a game in conference play, did not dress after suffering a concussion in the first half of an 84-73 victory at Arizona on Thursday. Twin brother David Wear started in his place, and there was a dropoff. Too, ASU assistant coach Eric Musselman, who prepared the scouting report on UCLA, added a defensive wrinkle to help contain Adams and Muhammad, with Carson helping off screens. Adams and Muhammad were 15 for 32; the other Bruins were 10 for 40. The Sun Devils also limited UCLA to six transition points, another area of emphasis. Felix had 20 points (on 8-of-12 shooting) and 11 rebounds for his seventh double-double of the year. Jon Gilling added seven points, 12 rebounds and a career-high eight assists, and Carson had 12 points and eight assists while playing the full 40 minutes. After scoring 28 points against USC, Evan Gordon had 12 points. ""We could go down the list of guys... It was a day when everybody performed his role well. The defensive end of the floor, probably more than anything, was the difference for us. Defensively, we were locked in mentally, good attention to detail, and played with a lot of energy and tremendous heart,"" Sendek said. ASU talked in the preseason about striving to be an elite team. Asked about that following the UCLA game, the Sun Devils were somewhat muted. ""I think we're getting close. I think we still have some stuff we need to clean up. We have to continue to get better. To stay consistent, is the key for us. I definitely think we are on our way. We just have to keep chipping away and keep working,"" Felix said.",Raw Data
35,"MILWAUKEE Brewers first baseman Corey Hart underwent knee surgery Friday, three days after it was originally scheduled. Brewers physician Dr. William Raasch debrided the joint surface in Hart's right knee and repaired a small meniscal tear. The surgery is expected to keep Hart out for four months, with his return expected in late May at the earliest. It was announced Jan. 18 that Hart needed knee surgery and that the procedure would take place Tuesday in Milwaukee. On Tuesday morning, the Brewers said Hart had postponed the surgery and would seek a second opinion from Dr. Richard Steadman in Vail, Colo. Steadman agreed with Raasch's initial diagnosis and the surgery took place Friday. The 30-year-old Hart who missed most of last spring after having surgery to repair cartilage tears in the same knee noticed swelling in his knee while going through offseason workouts. After surgery last spring, Hart recovered quickly and was ready for Opening Day. When first baseman Mat Gamel tore his ACL in early May, Hart shifted from right field to first base. A combination of Hart playing well at first base and the emergence of right fielder Norichika Aoki led to the team's decision to keep Hart at first base for the 2013 season. The two-time All-Star hit .270 with 30 home runs and 83 RBI in 2012. With Hart out for the majority of the first two months of the season, Gamel will get the first crack at becoming the everyday first baseman.",Raw Data
36,"﻿It looks a mis-match on paper: the runaway Bundesliga leaders, winners of the European Cup four times, against an Arsenal side that lost 1-0 to Championship Blackburn in the FA Cup at the weekend. In his press conference, though, Arsene Wenger was adamant that ""you cannot compare the FA Cup to the Champions League"", and across two legs - the first of which comes in London on Tuesday night - Arsenal will hold some hope of springing a surprise in the last-16. Bayern Munich's record is daunting - they have conceded only one goal away from home in the Bundesliga this season - but anything can happen in Europe, can't it? We asked our offices from around the continent to give us their predictions ahead of the big game, and you can read who Europe thinks will advance to the quarter-finals – including the opinions of both the British and German Eurosport offices. Our European cousins also gave us their view on Wenger's current position... The lost final against Chelsea was the most moving experience in the history of the club. Now the players of Bayern Munich are willing to give everything to alleviate the pain. And they will succeed. The team is more compact than ever before, has matured and is definitely merciless. For Arsenal, their chances of reaching the quarter-finals are quite bad. The championship is gone, the FA Cup too. It seems as though Arsene Wenger is putting everything on the Champions League to bring a long-awaited title to the Gunnners. That could be wrong, and in turn could force the club to seek new ideas. Whether they will come from Wenger is doubtful. Over two legs Arsenal have no chance against a Bayern side who are without doubt one of the finest in Europe at the moment – and arguably in the top three. Jupp Heynckes's team haven’t conceded a single goal yet in 2013 and, most worryingly for Arsenal, have only conceded one away goal all season in the Bundesliga. Given Arsenal’s recent struggle for form I can’t see anything other than a sizeable defeat for Arsenal over two legs. It is a defining contest for Wenger in that it will almost certainly confirm another season without silverware, but the real damage has been done in the domestic cups with defeats to lower-league opposition against Bradford and Blackburn. On Saturday the atmosphere was as poisonous as it ever has been under Wenger and fans were openly shouting abuse at him. Another poor performance on Tuesday will probably mean more of the same – and unless something miraculous happens, Arsenal won’t be in the next round. Arsenal have no chance against Bayern Munich. They are too strong, too powerful for Giroud and his lads. I say it again, Arsenal will finish this season without any trophy. For sure. More than the difference in quality between the two sides, I think it is the style of play of Bayern that will hurt the Gunners. Concerning Wenger, it seems if I have read the English press correctly that he still has a future in London, with plenty of money to spend next summer. That is good for him and for Arsenal but, more than the more money, I have big doubts concerning the targets of the manager. Jovetic and others are good players but you don't win the Premier League with them. In the Champions League all options are possible, but the chances of Arsenal getting past Bayern Munich don't seem brilliant. Why? Because this Arsenal side is definitely not one of the best 20 in Europe at present. Nowadays, Bayern is not only a runner-up, they are one of the best teams in the world and runaway leaders of the Bundesliga. There is not much of a chance for Arsenal without a leader on the pitch and the fading passion of Arsene Wenger is not enough. WINNER: Bayern Munich Bayern are playing really well at the moment: five wins in a row and no goals conceded in 2013, so they’re surely favourites to progress to the last eight. But they shouldn't be overconfident: even if the 'clean-sheet-mantra' is working fine at the moment, the Bavarians weren’t that brilliant in their last two away games against Mainz and Wolfsburg and they’ll have to be focused during the whole match in London to avoid any slip-up. Individually, Bayern’s class is on another level, with Ribery, Kroos, Mueller and Mandzukic all enjoying a great season so far. But Arsenal are also good up front, as Walcott, Podolski and Cazorla are fast and skilled enough to cause problems to Van Buyten and Dante. Even if they’re dangerous on the counter, though, the Gunners seem vulnerable at the back and that’s why they’re going to struggle against Bayern, a team capable of playing a 70 per cent possession match with ease. So it seems to be Bayern all the way, but don’t forget the Champions League is Champions League, and remember what happened to Chelsea last season... The comparison between Arsenal and a kindergarten bores me to death but some things never change. Arsenal is still a kindergarten, not in terms of the age of their players but in terms of their behaviour. They always lose to physical teams and they almost always don't win big games. Arsenal are able to create something interesting in one game, mainly due to their courage, but to win after two games they need something more than just courage. They need character, they need power of will and they need strength to overcome a huge opponent. I'm afraid that Arsenal have become the team who can run and gun against Readings only. And that's the reason Arsene Wenger should leave - even good things have an end. I'd say Arsenal will lose to Bayern Munich without any doubt. At this stage of the Champions League anything is possible, but that doesn't change the fact that Bayern are a strong favourite in the battle for a place in the quarter-final. Bayern are at the very top of their form and Arsenal's present level will not be enough. A defeat against German rivals should not influence Arsene Wenger's future at the club though. For him the most important thing is where the club finish in the Premier League. WINNER: Bayern Munich Anything is possible in the last-16 of the Champions League, except an Arsenal win. Bayern Munich are in unbelievable form. They have conceded only seven goals in 22 Bundesliga games. Besides their defensive performance, their offensive performance is extraordinary. And Arsenal lost in the FA Cup which was their only hope. They expect too much from players like Mertesacker, Giroud and Arteta. These players are not at the top level and this is their problem. We can’t expect that Arsenal will beat Bayern Munich. WINNER: Bayern Munich Arsenal still have the ability to produce a great performance but it rarely happens nowadays. They can probably disturb Bayern Munich in the first leg thanks to their attacking strength but over two meetings there is no chance. Arsene Wenger’s future at the club though is not in danger. As long as the club is profitable he will keep his job as long as he wants. Even if I feel his time at the club should be over.

37,"Klay Thompson scored a career-high 32 points and the Warriors, playing without three starters and a key reserve, beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-95 Tuesday night. The Warriors were missing guard Stephen Curry (ankle), center Andrew Bogut (ankle) and forward Harrison Barnes (knee). Also, Carl Landry, one of the first players off Golden State's bench, didn't play because of a shoulder injury. In all, the Warriors were missing an average of 49.1 points and 19.5 rebounds, but that didn't matter. Golden State shot 54 percent, including 11 for 16 on 3-pointers as it hit the first nine from beyond the arc. The Warriors took control in the second quarter and built a 16-point lead in the second half. ''No matter who is out there, we're still going to play Warriors basketball,'' said David Lee, had 20 points and 13 rebounds. ''We could have mailed it in on the last game of a road trip, but everybody stepped up with a bunch of guys out.'' The Warriors played the finale of a four-game road trip and were coming off a victory in Toronto on Monday. ''That's a big-time win,'' Golden State coach Mark Jackson said. ''That's a statement game for us. I'm extremely proud of my guys. It would've been very easy to chalk one up (a loss) because we were short-handed, but I challenged them - and they stepped up.'' Jarrett Jack, starting at point guard, had 26 points and 12 assists. Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving, who missed the morning shootaround because he was sick, scored 14 points on 5-for-17 shooting in 36 minutes. Irving was coming off the best week of his career when he averaged a league-best 35.7 points in three wins, was selected as a reserve to the Eastern Conference All-Star team, and was named the conference's player of the week on Monday. ''I just wasn't there in terms of my mental focus,'' Irving said. ''That's no excuse. I tried to play through it, but my normal energy wasn't there. I'm just feeling like crap.'' ''He didn't look like himself,'' Cleveland coach Byron Scott said. ''I didn't think, obviously, he was 100 percent.'' Scott warned his players before the game that the Warriors would be ready to play. It would appear they didn't listen. ''We've got to treat it like a wounded animal,'' he said. ''It has no choice. It's going to come out fighting.'' ''They just kicked our butts, to be honest with you,'' Irving said. Tristan Thompson had 18 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland, and Dion Waiters also scored 18 points. The Cavaliers fell short in their bid for their first four-game winning streak since late in the 2009-10 season - LeBron James' final year with the team. Klay Thompson was 13 of 24 from the field, including 6 for 8 on 3s. ''It wasn't just me,'' he said. ''My teammates found me, and we just played great tonight. We didn't have four of our premier players, but it just shows the depth of our team.'' Curry, who leads the Warriors with a 21-point average, didn't play after twisting his right ankle Monday. Jackson said he doesn't know how long Curry, who has had surgery on the ankle in each of the past two offseasons, will be out. Bogut, who returned Monday after missing 38 games with an injury to his left ankle, likely won't play in back-to-back games until after the All-Star break. Barnes, a rookie, was out with a sore left knee sustained against Toronto while Landry, a forward off the bench, was sidelined with a bruised left shoulder that also occurred Monday. Golden State raced to a 13-4 lead less than four minutes into the game. The Cavaliers regrouped and led 27-25 in the second quarter, but the Warriors regained control. Klay Thompson hit three 3-pointers, a jump shot and a dunk to help the Warriors build a 13-point lead twice. Golden State led 55-44 and shot 59 percent, including making all six of their 3-point attempts, in the first half. The Warriors' continued to pull away in the third quarter when Thompson hit two 3-pointers and scored 12 points. Golden State led 84-68 going into the fourth quarter. The Cavaliers, who rallied from a 20-point deficit to defeat Milwaukee on Friday, cut the lead to 97-89 with about three minutes to play, but Jack hit a 3-pointer and another basket, pushing the lead to 102-89. Notes: G Kent Bazemore, an undrafted rookie, scored a career-high nine points for Golden State. ... Jack tied a career high with his 12 assists. ... Cavaliers F Alonzo Gee was scoreless in 28 minutes. ... F Luke Walton (left foot and ankle) missed his second straight game. ... G Daniel Gibson (sprained right big toe) was also out. ...

39,"Former WNBA player and Olympic gold medalist Chamique Holdsclaw is being indicted in a November 2012 shooting in Atlanta, prosecutors said Wednesday. A six-count indictment charges Holdsclaw, 35, with aggravated assault, criminal damage and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Fulton County District Attorney's spokeswoman Yvette Jones said Wednesday. Holdsclaw was arrested after an argument with Tulsa Shock player Jennifer Lacy, 29, who told police she was Holdsclaw's ex-girlfriend. The two were also Atlanta Dream teammates in 2009. Holdsclaw broke the windows to Lacy's car and shot at it Nov. 13, 2012, police said. No one was injured. After a late-November court appearance, one of Holdsclaw's attorneys said he talked with Lacy and they were trying to resolve the case. ''They are still friends and we expect the alleged victim to support a proper resolution of this,'' said Edward Garland, an attorney representing Holdsclaw. ''In no way did she use the gun to threaten or assault the alleged victim, or do so with a baseball bat.'' He acknowledged that Holdsclaw caused damage to Lacy's car, but said his client never intended to hurt her. ''Sometimes charges get made that exceed the scope of the actual events,'' Garland said, adding that he and his client plan to resolve the case without it going to trial. Holdsclaw is out on $100,000 bond and a court date has not been scheduled. Holdsclaw led the University of Tennessee to three consecutive national championships from 1996-98 before beginning a pro career that included six WNBA All-Star selections. She also played on the U.S. Olympic team that won the gold medal in the 2000 Games. She had 3,025 career points at Tennessee and remains the Southeastern Conference's career scoring leader. In September, Holdsclaw returned to her alma mater to discuss her fight with clinical depression, which included a suicide attempt during her pro career. Holdsclaw recounted how she attempted suicide in 2006 as a member of the Los Angeles Sparks by overdosing on the medication she was taking for clinical depression.

40,"Sobotka scored from close range at 2:16 of overtime to give the Blues a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Wild on Sunday night. St. Louis is 5-1, its best start since winning seven of its first eight in 1997-98. Coming off a 4-3 victory in Dallas on Saturday night, the Blues also improved to 3-0 at home. Andy McDonald circled around the net and fed Sobotka for the winner ''I just saw it landed right on my stick and it was kind of a weird shot, but it landed up in the net and I was happy,'' he said. Minnesota's Dany Heatley forced the overtime, tying it at 4 when he batted the puck out of the air with 4:08 left in regulation for his fourth goal of the season. The Wild have lost three straight. Chris Stewart, Barret Jackman, Wade Redden and Patrik Berglund also scored for St. Louis, and Brian Elliott, getting his first home start, made 12 saves. Blues coach Ken Hitchcock wasn't certain how his team would respond after playing six games in nine days. ''I've been around a long time, but the third period was impressive,'' Hitchcock said. ''Back to back, it was a very physical game last night, and to come with that type of effort was a real confidence booster. We didn't get down on ourselves. We really took our game to another level.'' After taking a 1-0 lead in the first, the Blues gave up three consecutive goals before rallying. ''We kept battling. We kept battling and (Sobotka) capped with a great overtime goal,'' Jackman said. Zach Parise had two goals and an assist for Minnesota after also scoring twice in the Wild's 5-3 loss in Detroit on Friday night. Mikko Koivu added a goal, and Niklas Backstrom stopped 32 shots. ''It doesn't matter, we lost the game,'' Parise said. ''We have to win games here.'' Stewart and Jackman scored 2:18 apart midway through the third to give the Blues a 4-3 lead. Stewart tied it with his fourth goal, a deflection off Alex Pietrangelo's shot, and Jackman put the Blues in front. Parise scored on Minnesota's first two shots in the second period, both on power plays, to give the Wild a 2-1 lead. Koivu added a goal on a 4 on 4 to make it 3-1 in the second, but Berglund countered 1:01 later to pull the Blues within one. Redden scored for the second consecutive night for the Blues after going nearly three years without an NHL goal. He slapped a shot from near the left boards about midway through the first period to open the scoring. St. Louis entered the game as the best power-play team in the NHL, converting seven of 16 opportunities, but failed on five chances against the Wild, with just three shots. Minnesota took three penalties in the first nine minutes of the third period. Despite not giving up a goal while a man short, the extra work tired the Wild. ''It was a recipe on how to lose a game,'' Wild coach Mike Yeo said. ''The bottom line is we can sit here and talk about our potential, the fact that we have a nice team on paper. (But) the winners do things that it takes to win hockey games.''

41,"Woods owns a two-shot lead after using the North Course’s short par 5s to shoot 65 on Friday. He was 5-under on the four par 5s, including an eagle at No. 18 (his ninth hole) after hitting a long-iron shot within 10 feet. He missed just two fairways and was confident enough with the driver to use it even on the North Course’s shortest par 4s. He made birdie at the uphill 326-yard, par-4 second hole after hitting a driver in the fairway 40 yards short of the green and hitting the flagstick with his approach. “I drove the ball great and took advantage of the par 5s,” Woods said. “I’ve had beautiful practice sessions at home. Even though last week (in Abu Dhabi) I only played two days, I felt like I hit the ball well enough to shoot a better score than I did. ... I had a couple days at home to work on it, and I came out here (and) felt pretty good about it.” Woods, who missed the cut in last week’s Abu Dhabi Championship, is seeking his seventh victory at the Farmers Insurance Open and eighth PGA Tour victory at Torrey Pines. His win at the 2008 US Open here is his last major championship. 2. In the spotlight Get caught up with all the action with our PGA Tour leaderboard. Billy Horschel, who trails Tiger by two strokes, is an excitable guy. He doesn’t like waiting for late tee times, even though they’re an indicator of success. Good thing for him that the final group at the Farmers Insurance Open tees off at 9:40 a.m. Saturday. Horschel will play with Woods and Casey Wittenberg, the 2012 Web.com Tour Player of the Year. “It helps a lot,” Horschel said of the earlier tee time. “Waiting until 1:30, 2:00, I (don’t) know what to do with myself because I don’t sleep in very late. I’ve found a couple things I need to do before I tee off to keep my mind away from wandering.” Horschel shot 69 Friday at Torrey Pines South to move into second place. This was his 14th consecutive cut made, the third-best active streak on Tour. He hopes his experience at the 2007 Walker Cup will help him handle Saturday’s large crowds. This will be his first round with Woods. “There was a guy I competed against three times called Rory McIlroy,” Horschel said. That Walker Cup was held in McIlroy’s home country, Northern Ireland. “There may have been (10,000), 12,000 people following us.” 3. Victory seekers Woods make it look easy, shooting a 7-under 65 to lead at Torrey Pines. Horschel isn’t the only contender seeking his first PGA Tour victory. In fact, Woods’ seven closest pursuers have a combined zero PGA Tour victories. Six players are tied for third at 8-under 136 — Wittenberg, Brad Fritsch, Erik Compton, Steve Marino, Jimmy Walker and Josh Teater. Three of those six — Wittenberg, Fritsch and Compton — earned their cards through last year’s Q-School or Web.com Tour. Horschel also regained his PGA Tour card at last year’s Q-School. 4. Falling down K.J. Choi and Brandt Snedeker, the co-leaders after shooting first-round 65s, both were over par on Friday. Choi shot 73 on the easier North Course, while Snedeker, the defending champion, shot a second-round 75 on the South Course. Snedeker’s 75 was just his second over-par round at Torrey Pines since 2009. He shot a 2-over 74 in last year’s third round. Snedeker has finished in the top 10 at this event for three consecutive years. He was runner-up here in 2010 and tied for ninth in 2011 before winning last year. Choi had never finished better than 15th in this event. 5. Short shots • Mike Weir shot 75 Friday at Torrey Pines’ South Course, but it was enough for him to make his first cut since 2011. Weir had failed to make the cut in his previous 18 PGA Tour starts. He’s tied for 41st at 3-under 141 (66-75). • Jordan Spieth missed the cut in his PGA Tour debut as a professional, shooting 1-over 145 (72-73). His next PGA Tour start is expected to come at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. • US Amateur champion Steven Fox missed the cut after shooting 70-78. • Luke List was 2-under on his first six holes Friday to get into second place at 8-under. He triple-bogeyed his final hole, the par-5 18th at Torrey Pines South, to shoot 75, though. He’s now at 3-under. • Rickie Fowler was in 154th place after a first-round 77 on the South Course. He made the cut, though, after shooting 65 on the North. • For the second consecutive week, the three-time Farmers Insurance Open winner Phil Mickelson flirted with missing the cut. At last week’s Humana Challenge, he birdied two of his last three holes Saturday to make the cut by two. This week, he made the cut on the number at 1-under.",Raw Data
42,"Tiger Woods has had it right all along, and golf’s ruling bodies finally have it right, too. After hinting the Euro Tour might be in his future, Tiger Woods puts an end to such talk. Anchoring a putter against the body contravenes the spirit of the game. And now it will contravene the rules, too. In a move that will cause seismic divisions throughout professional golf — and bring anxiety attacks to Sunday morning hackers with the yips — anchoring of belly and broomstick putters will be outlawed. The United States Golf Association, which sets rules for the United States and Mexico, and Britain’s Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which governs the game throughout the rest of the world, announced the sweeping ban on Wednesday morning. Because of golf’s arcane structures, the change won't take effect until Jan. 1, 2016. Speaking on Tuesday ahead of his World Challenge tournament, Woods welcomed the ban he’s long advocated. “The art of putting is swinging the club and controlling nerves and having it as a fixed point, as I was saying all year, is something that’s not in the traditions of the game,” he said. “We swing all other 13 clubs; I think the putter should be the same.” The final straw for the game’s ruling bodies wasn’t so much that three of the past five major champions — Keegan Bradley, Webb Simpson and Ernie Els — became the first ever to win majors with belly putters, but that young players are not even bothering with conventional putters. Guan Tianglang, a 14-year-old from China, used a belly putter to win the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship this month, earning a spot into the Masters, where he’ll be the youngest competitor in the history of the only major not won by a belly putter. “One of the things that I was concerned about going forward is the kids who get started in the game and start to putt with an anchoring system,” Woods said. “There have been some guys who have had success out here, and, obviously, everyone always copies what we do out here, and that’s something that I think for the greater good of the game needs to be adjusted.” Adam Scott, whose career has benefited since he switched to a broomstick putter in 2010, not surprisingly disagrees with those arguments. “I understand about the kids using belly putters and not short putters, but they also have never used a 1-iron!” he wrote in an email. “That argument has no relevance, in my opinion. There is no proof that putting with an anchored style putter is easier, better or stops nerves. It is a different method that some people find more comfortable and others don't. There are no facts to say that you WILL make more putts putting with an anchored putter. “My opinion is that the governing bodies are in place to protect the integrity of the game not the traditions of the game.” Scott was joined by Bradley and Simpson, who also spoke out against the ban on Tuesday. South African Tim Clark, who uses a long putter, already has threatened legal action. “People have said to me, having a belly putter takes the hands out of it,” said Simpson, who’s already practicing with a conventional putter to prepare for the change. “Well, I was shaking in my boots over the last putt at the US Open. So short putter, belly putter, I was nervous as can be. “To change something that drastic, it has to be based off facts and not what certain people think the tradition of the game looks like. Show me the facts.” He and his anchoring brethren point to the fact that professionals who hold a putter against their bodies aren’t statistically among the best putters. But there are plenty of other pros who think that they’ve got an edge over the competition. “I do think it’s an advantage,” said Steve Stricker, one of the better putters in the game. “Even though it is fair under the rules, I’m just not a huge believer in it.” Brandt Snedeker, another good (conventional) putter, empathizes with “guys whose careers are at stake.” “The USGA’s in a tough spot. They need to decide what’s the best thing for the game going forward, not make decisions just based on the PGA Tour,” he said. “It has more to do with the fact that there’s a whole generation of golfers growing up who’ve never used a short putter. Now, is that keeping with the traditions of the game? Is that where they want the game of golf going in the next 40 or 50 years? I can see why they want to do something like this. “But let’s be clear about this: The reason guys use belly putters is because they work. If they didn’t work, they wouldn’t use them. “I'm against belly putters. I want guys who have a five-footer to win a golf tournament to feel as nervous as I do with that putter in my hands and let them deal with that and figure out a way to manage that. The belly putter takes that out of play a little bit.” Not for much longer.",Raw Data
43,"Taking the positives from yesterday’s play on the ATP Tour isn’t too difficult, despite my main bet being beaten in Marseille. I managed to identify that Janko Tipsarevic and Juan Martin Del Potro would not have the easy games that their respective odds suggested and so it proved: Tipsarevic was beaten and Delpo should also have been packing his bags. But Julien Benneteau was disappointing in his match with Jerzy Janowicz and once he’d played an awful tie break it was curtains for the Frenchman. Quarter-finals day in Memphis kicks off with Tipsarevic’s conqueror Dmitry Tursunov taking on the man who took down Richard Gasquet – the big leftie Gilles Muller. I wouldn’t like to pick a winner in that match and there’s not a great deal of value in the 1.24 about Jo-Wilfried Tsonga over Bernard Tomic in the second match of the day either. I would expect Tomas Berdych to come through against Janowicz, but Del Potro does tend to struggle against the defensive skills of Gilles Simon. I might be tempted to back over 22.5 total games in that one at around 2.0. Over in Memphis there’s an opportunity to back Kei Nishikori at a nice price of around 1.85 against Marin Cilic. Their quarter-final match begins at 8pm UK time this evening. The pair have played on four previous occasions, with the score tied at 2-2, but the Japanese player comes into this much the fresher of the two. Kei has played just two matches since the Australian Open compared with Cilic’s eight. To put it another way the Croatian has played 23 sets to Nishikori’s four since Melbourne and both of Cilic’s matches here have been real struggles. He just scraped past Igor Sijsling 9-7 in a final set breaker yesterday. The injury prone Nishikori seems to be managing his schedule well and when he is fit he’s tough to beat. He’s had no problems defeating two pretty poor opponents in Memphis so far this week, but those matches should have tuned him up nicely for tonight. He should get the better of a fatigued opponent in Cilic. Best bet: Back Nishikori to beat Cilic at 1.85",Raw Data

He said: ""We have a great team but this shows we still have to show more maturity on the mental front and understand what it means to win big games. "" ""Of course we did not expect to lose this game and now it is vital we respond in a strong way tomorrow night."" ""We came out with a flat performance and it shows that, mentally, we are not capable at the moment of preparing in exactly the same way for every game. "" The players took on board how important the FA Cup was but maybe they still thought, OK, were playing at home against ­Blackburn, it will be difficult but we will win the game anyway. But in football it does not work like that. It is vital for us to fight for silverware but unfortunately the FA Cup will not happen for us now. We can only look at ourselves and not complain about anything else. They are really hurt but you have to take it on the chin and come back with a strong response. Arsenals players still believe they can win the Champions League but Wenger was a lot more guarded after this latest crisis.

Arsenal could not find a way back even after he threw on big guns Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott. But Wenger defended his team selection, saying: ""To suggest the team was weak would be the wrong way of thinking about the game."" ""I am the first to stand up and say I am responsible for the team selection but that is not an excuse.

45,"MIAMI The Miami Heat already are working on their game plan for Monday's visit to the White House. This time, they will put air in the ball. On their White House visit in March 2007 for winning the 2006-07 championship, the Heat presented then President George W. Bush with a jersey and an autographed ball. He tried to bounce the ball, but it hit the floor with a thud and didn't come back up. ""It was an autographed ball,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, then a Miami assistant. ""It wasn't a real ball. We'll make sure we have a real ball. There wasn't enough air in it (before). When (Bush) bounced it, it was like bouncing a bag of sand."" Fortunately for the Heat, winning another title last June has given them another chance to practice their skills in Washington. The White House made it official Wednesday that the Heat will meet with President Barack Obama on Monday. Actually, several Heat players are now old hands at visiting the White House. Beginning with the invitation six years ago, at least six have been there. Guard Dwyane Wade and forward Udonis Haslem both remain the from the 2006 title team. Wade also visited Obama at the White House for a Father's Day event in June 2009 and was among a number of NBA players who ran with Obama in pickup games in August 2010. Wade's 2010 visit also featured Heat forwards LeBron James and Shane Battier, the latter then with Houston. Battier also visited with Bush following winning the 2001 national title with Duke. Heat guard Mario Chalmers saw Bush following Kansas' 2008 NCAA title. And guard Ray Allen visited the White House to see Bush after Boston's 2008 NBA title. ""It's special any time you get invited to the White House, especially when you go as champions,"" Wade said. ""It gets no better than that. It will be a great moment for the organization and individually for a lot of us."" Some of Wade's best memories of seeing Obama came from the 2010 pickup games, which were played at a gym inside Washington's Fort McNair and followed by a barbecue at the White House to celebrate the President's 49th birthday. Other NBA players invited included Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Derrick Rose, Grant Hill, Chauncey Billups and David West as well as retired stars Bill Russell and Magic Johnson. ""He's very personable,"" Wade said of Obama. ""He makes everybody feel like you've known him for a while."" Wade and Battier were on Obama's team for the games. Wade said Obama is a point guard who ""can hit the open shots"" and is ""kind of a smooth player."" But he didn't butter him up too much. ""A lot of high school guys I played with probably,"" Wade said when asked to compare Obama to another player. Wade and Battier lost the first two games they played with Obama. But they didn't leave winless. ""We lost the first two and he said, We're not losing three. It's my birthday,""' Battier said. ""He wouldn't let us lose the last game. He actually hit the last shot (to win it)."" Battier is the only Heat player to have visit with two presidents at the White House. He still laughs when recalling meeting Bush. ""W reminded me of a cool uncle. He was cool. He gave me some dap,"" said Battier, referring to a hip handshake. ""He said Shane, it's good to me to meet you.' (Battier thought to himself), All right, the President's got some flavor. He gave me dap.""' But perhaps the best greeting a Heat player has gotten from a president came when Obama spoke at Cleveland State two years ago, when guard Norris Cole was as senior for the Vikings. Obama was impressed by Cole's high-top fade haircut. ""He recognized me because of my hair. He shook my hand and said Kid n Play,""' Cole said about being singled out from his front-row seat and referring to the musical group from the 1990s. Cole is looking forward to seeing Obama again. Chalmers said meeting Obama is the ""main thing"" that excites him about his second White House visit. ""We won't hold it against him that he's a Bulls fan,"" Spoelstra said of Obama, who follows the NBA closely. ""But everybody (on the Heat), including the staff, we'll bring our shoes just in case we play a pickup game."" The Heat also will make sure somebody pumps up the ball they bring.",Raw Data

""That's bad news, for sure, for the fans and for Mayer, especially,"" world number five Nadal said at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. ""I talked with him. It seemed like it's nothing very, very bad. ""Just a typical back problem, beginning when he was warming up his serve. The physio says maybe in four days, five days he will be ready. That's the most important thing, that nothing is serious."" Asked when he had heard that Mayer had pulled out of the tournament, left-hander Nadal replied: ""I was ready (for the match). I was doing my fingers tape. ""I am so sorry for him especially. I talked with him just one minute, two minutes. He was calm and said no. Sad situation."" Mayer's withdrawal came as a mixed blessing for Nadal who could do with more matches under his belt as he continues his comeback after being sidelined for seven months last year by a lingering left knee injury. Seeded fifth at Indian Wells where he won the title in 2007 and 2009, the former world number one beat American Ryan Harrison 7-6 6-2 in his opening match here as he competes in his first tournament on a hardcourt surface in almost a year. Nadal only returned to the ATP circuit last month in South America but his heavily anticipated comeback went surprisingly well as he won twice after reaching the final in three relatively minor claycourt events. ""I gonna go a little bit to the gym, I gonna go practise a little bit more later, but no match,"" Nadal said of his plans for the rest of the day. ""I am not practising a lot."" Nadal won his 11th grand slam singles title at the French Open last June before his season came to an abrupt end two weeks later following a defeat to Czech journeyman Lukas Rosol in the second round at Wimbledon. Mayer's withdrawal was the second shock of the day for Nadal who had earlier been frightened by a flurry of three earthquakes, measured at magnitudes of 4.6 and 4.7, that rattled the Southern California desert. The quakes struck shortly before 10 a.m. local time within moments of each other about 22 miles south of the resort community of Palm Springs. ""I was very scared,"" Nadal smiled.

49,"Pablo Barrera received the latest in a series of humbling reminders about the current state of his affairs during the second half of Cruz Azul's 1-0 win over Puebla on Sunday afternoon. In a match his struggling side needed to win against an overwhelmed opponent reduced to ten men, Barrera offered few signs to suggest he had once earned a £4million move to West Ham United, featured three times as a substitute at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa or tormented Jonathan Bornstein in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final little more than a year ago. Cruz Azul manager Guillermo Vázquez decided he could live without Barrera's minimal contributions to the game as his side chased the winner Mariano Pavone eventually provided seven minutes from time. The choice to hand reserve team midfielder Raúl Vidal a first-team debut in Barrera's place merely underscored Vázquez's displeasure with the situation. Barrera cut short his European excursion after two seasons to avoid this exact type of scenario. He returned to Mexico last month to obtain regular playing time at club level and rediscover the type of form required to retain his place in José Manuel “Chepo” de la Torre's lineup on the international stage. On his best days, Barrera deserves his usual spot on the right flank for both club and country and shows why several European sides expressed interest in signing him from UNAM Pumas in the wake of his World Cup displays two years ago. The 25-year-old offers a technical, two-footed approach to his work in the wide areas. His quickness allows him to use his skill to attack and exploit opposing defenders with the ball at his feet. Once he isolates his marker, he explodes toward goal to combine with others or test the opposing goalkeeper with a drive from distance. His respectable goalscoring record during his days with Pumas and his valued support work with Mexico provide proof of his ability to contribute at the sharp end. Barrera's current issues stem from his inability to produce enough of those displays when he joined West Ham in time for the 2010-11 season. He started just six matches in league play during his one full season with the club as he struggled to settle into a new competitive setting and a vastly different culture. West Ham's poor league form and somewhat robust tactical deportment under Avram Grant offered him fewer opportunities to impress as other players jumped ahead of him in the queue. Former Mexico boss Javier Aguirre brought Barrera to Real Zaragoza on loan last season in a bid to help the winger rediscover his form in a league more suited to his technical qualities. Aguirre included Barrera and fellow Mexico teammate Efrain Juárez (another misfit loan signing from Celtic) in his plans at the start of the season, but Barrera's promising run of matches in the starting XI unceremoniously concluded in early December. The end of Aguirre's tenure shortly before the new year pushed Barrera out of the first-team picture and restricted him to the occasional appearance off the substitutes' bench as his teammates staved off relegation. A return to West Ham this summer never looked particularly likely given his bumpy first season, the club's return to the English top flight and Sam Allardyce's utilitarian set of expectations for his wingers. Instead of trying to fight his way into Allardyce's plans, Barrera decided to pursue a return to Mexico and eventually sealed a move to Cruz Azul for an undisclosed fee last month in an attempt to revive his career. Such a prudent decision makes a great deal of sense for a player seeking to retain his place in the national team set-up, but it also places the burden of expectation on him to succeed under a significant amount of scrutiny. There are no loan moves to make and no places to hide for Barrera in his native country. He has proven that he can thrive in Liga MX, but he must now do so all over again. Early returns indicate Barrera may face more of a struggle than he anticipated as he attempts to establish his place in the team. Vázquez prefers a 4-4-2 formation that doesn't fit Barrera's strengths as neatly as the 4-2-3-1 employed by de la Torre usually does. Barrera will do the necessary work in his defensive half required in this type of set-up, but his effectiveness wanes the further he is from the opponent's penalty area. His modest production of no goals, no assists and three shots in his first four appearances suggests he must find the confidence necessary to fuel his incisive forays and plot alternative ways to make his presence felt in the run of play. If Barrera does not improve his form in rather short order, de la Torre will face increasingly vociferous calls to omit the speedy winger from the national team picture. Barrera's displays at international level this year have fallen well short of the lofty standards established by his Gold Cup and World Cup exploits. He kept his spot for qualifying wins over Grenada and El Salvador in June, but de la Torre's continued insistence on substituting him during the second half betrays the rather tenuous hold he maintains on his starting place. The onus now falls on Barrera to persuade de la Torre and Vázquez to view him as an integral figure for both club and country. Only an uptick in form will prevent the type of scenario Barrera suffered on Sunday afternoon from occurring more frequently. He possesses more than enough ability to come through this difficult stretch, but he must do so in relatively short order to ensure those temporary setbacks do not transform into a status quo he will likely find far more difficult to overcome.

Never has an athlete been more ready to grab the bully pulpit provided by the excessive word orgy that is the lead-up to the Super Bowl than Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis. Because if the Gospel according to Tebow led to unnecessary controversy, which it did, wait until they get a load of The Gospel according to Ray. He has been preaching God as a Ravens fan for a while now, most recently to Sal Palantonio in the aftermath of the Ravens victory in the AFC Championship game, and many view this as hypocrisy. Or heresy. Or worse. We shushed religion talk from Tim Tebow because he was not a good enough player. Now with Lewis, a Hall of Famer, it is because he is not a good enough man. Our problem is not with the messengers at all but the message. We want a separation of church and football. But why? What about Lewis crediting God for Baltimore’s amazing run gets us so crossways? “When you sacrifice something for God, he will give you anything your heart desires if it aligns with his will,” Lewis said in Sunday’s crazy aftermath. “… God just kept telling me ‘No weapon formed against me shall prosper. No weapon formed against my team shall prosper.’ ” I feel compelled to point out this is from Isaiah 54:17, with the Holman Christian Standard Bible translation particularly helpful in the case of Lewis. “No weapon formed against you will succeed, and you will refute any accusation raised against you in court.” Marino's 1984 Dolphins were mighty, but didn't deliver. That makes them one of the top teams that didn't win the Super Bowl. It is impossible to write about Lewis — what he says, how he plays, his legacy, his faith — without bringing up what he may or may not have done in the wee hours of January 31, 2000. He had some level of involvement in a double murder following a Super Bowl party in Atlanta, as evidenced by blood in his car and a murder indictment against him that was dropped in exchange for testimony and undisclosed settlements with the victims’ families. Many remain unconvinced of his innocence. Most recent among them is Anna Burns Welker, wife of Patriots receiver Wes Welker, who wrote this on Facebook after Sunday’s game: “Proud of my husband and the Pats. By the way, if anyone is bored, please go to Ray Lewis’ Wikipedia page. 6 kids 4 wives. Acquitted for murder. Paid a family off. Yay. What a hall of fame player! A true role model!” So the people who do not like athletes talking about religion are annoyed with the Gospel according to Ray and the people who loved this type of preaching from Tebow are not exactly in Lewis’ demographic. My question is why? Why do we love religion from Tebow and not Lewis? Because the reality is Lewis’ story is more symbolic of Christianity than Tebow’s. He epitomizes screwing up and being redeemed, of traveling far down a wrong road before turning around, of turning his life over to a higher power. It is not a stretch to say that whatever happened that night in Atlanta was Lewis’ come-to-Jesus moment. He has changed in the aftermath, which is why he always talks about God and salvation so fervently. I get that not everybody wants to hear him. These are cynical sports times we live in, replete with fake dead girlfriends and Hall of Famers charging a coach with intentionally losing a Super Bowl. It is a hard time to be selling faith, even harder to sell redemption. QBs add intrigue to Super Bowl XLVII matchup between 49ers and Ravens. An inside look And Lewis can be a little theatrical, if not outright preachy, when he talks. “Any time you trust in God, man can’t tell you what you can’t do,” Lewis said. “I respect the game too much and I was hurt when I saw a sign that actually said my retirement would end tonight. Man can’t dictate that. God dictates that.” The criticism is tethered to Lewis’ belief, or at least implication, that God wanted the Ravens to win. This is shaky theological ground, although in no way uncharted. God is rooting for my team was the general idea behind the crusades and just about every idiotic religious war since. I tend to believe God roots for everybody. But beliefs are beliefs and who are we to tell Lewis he is wrong? He actually seems to be sending a pretty good message, about how all things are possible through God and about believing in spite of the odds. He will say all of this loudly and fervently at the Super Bowl, using the bully pulpit provided to preach the Gospel of Ray. He has every right, just like Tebow before him. And if we stop complaining long enough to listen, we may just be inspired.",Raw Data
51,"The Los Angeles Sparks have experienced back-to-back defeats. Boo-hoo. Alana Beard, even more so than the average WNBA veteran, is not going to be fazed by such setbacks. When you've lost two seasons during the prime of your career, rebounding from losing two games doesn't seem like much of a challenge. Beard has been in the WNBA for nine seasons but been healthy enough to play for just seven. She celebrated her 30th birthday in May. Sometimes in recent years, the thought crept in her mind that perhaps she'd need to start her life's fourth decade by submerging completely in a new career: that of the businesswoman she has long planned to be. She is not one of those pro athletes who will wake up one day and say, ""Oh, no! Now what?"" So battling back from a chronically injured left ankle that often seemed to be fighting her every step of the way wasn't a quest borne by panic about what's next. But rather by a certainty that this particular journey isn't over yet. ""Sheer force of will, having a great support system with my family and having a goal,"" Beard said of what motivated her return. ""My mom reminded me a year ago that everything I ever told her I would do I've done. Starting out with telling her I was going to be on the honor roll in fifth grade. I told my parents they'd never have to worry about paying for my college education. And I told them I'd be back in the WNBA."" Feeling like I can't yet do everything exactly as I used to do it -- that was tough. But at some point, your instincts begin to take over and you start to really feel the game again. I'm not anywhere close to where I want to be with that. But I'm appreciative of where I am right now. -- Alana Beard She is, and has started all season for the Sparks, averaging 10.7 points and 3.4 assists in 31.7 minutes of play. Los Angeles signed her as a free agent in February, not long after the franchise had brought in Atlanta assistant Carol Ross to be head coach. Ross knew Beard's game from way back in college, when Ross was coach at Mississippi and Beard a player at Duke. In the WNBA, Ross had strategized on how to stop Beard while she was with Washington. Now they are both enjoying their first season in Los Angeles. It helps that they both are fluent in the same two primary languages. The first is English, of course. The second is defense. ""When I'm talking defense, and it probably sounds to half the team like I'm speaking Russian, Alana's locked in,"" Ross said, chuckling. ""She gets it. So that's natural with her. Nobody could walk on the court in the WNBA after two seasons away from it brimming with confidence. But I think that's where she went to for her confidence: defense first. She could learn to trust her body there."" That is an ongoing process. Beard had shredded her ankle so many times and so many ways over the years. She had to let it heal and not push too hard but also get herself back to doing the things she once did. Her play overseas convinced the Sparks she was ready to be back in the WNBA this summer. For someone who always gained her edge by working to the point of exhaustion, Beard had to adjust to giving herself a break. When she's working, it's still full-go. But now, finally, a day off really means a day off. The Olympic break wasn't really time ""off"" for any of the WNBA players who were not in London. But it did give them some recovery time, plus the opportunity to focus on individual skills. For Beard, it was a chance to work with Sparks assistant Sandy Brondello and her husband, Olaf Lange. Brondello and Lange have been involved with the WNBA for many years and excel at helping even the most veteran players hone essential fundamentals and mechanics. ""I was able to work with Sandy and Olaf on my footwork and gaining the feel for the game again,"" Beard said. ""Sandy is great at being a shooting coach. Olaf helped me understand coming off screens better, using my space with the skills I have now. ""I was not attacking like I used to, so I had to develop other things more, like pulling up for my jump shot and shooting the 3. Footwork has been one of the most important things for me. Gaining confidence that I may step on someone's foot, but that's OK. That's been my biggest struggle, too -- just the mental part."" [+] Enlarge Juan Ocampo/Getty Images Alana Beard is averaging 10.7 points, 3.4 assists and 31.7 minutes per game in her first season in Los Angeles. Indeed, when you suggest to Beard that it would be completely normal for someone on a surgically repaired ankle to have hesitation with doing certain things, she cuts right to the quick. ""It's fear. Fear of doing what I once did. I'll just put it out there,"" Beard said. ""In the beginning, I wasn't going in the lane like I used to because I was afraid of coming down on someone's foot the wrong way. But I've gained confidence in my body and my game. ""Feeling like I can't yet do everything exactly as I used to do it -- that was tough. But at some point, your instincts begin to take over and you start to really feel the game again. I'm not anywhere close to where I want to be with that. But I'm appreciative of where I am right now. So it's continuous work, hope and belief in a positive attitude."" A change of scenery has helped, too. Beard was drafted No. 2 overall in 2004 by Washington and was a four-time All-Star for the Mystics. She averaged 16.2 points during her six seasons of action with D.C. But she was sidelined by the ankle woes in 2010, when Washington finished first in the Eastern Conference. And once again she was forced to watch in 2011, when the Mystics plummeted to last place, where they remain this season. Realistically, Beard had enough on her plate with her own WNBA ""resurrection""; she didn't need the burden of trying to revive the Mystics, too. It made sense to get about as far away as possible, and L.A. offered the opportunity. ""Waking up to sunshine every day -- it's a great feeling,"" said Beard, and while she was speaking literally, you could take it metaphorically, too. ""I don't think I ever took the game for granted. But this is such a no-pressure environment. I'm playing with Candace Parker, Kristi Toliver, DeLisha Milton-Jones, Nneka Ogwumike, Ebony Hoffman, Jantel Lavender -- all of these players could be franchise players on other teams. You come into practice here every day knowing you just have to do your part, and that's it. You don't have to do everything. And Coach Ross is great about really taking the pressure off the players and putting it on herself. It's been fun."" After a nine-game winning streak, the past couple of games have been less fun for the Sparks: losses at Tulsa and Chicago, two hungry teams at or near the bottom of the standings. Tuesday, the Sparks' foe is the top team in the league: defending WNBA champ Minnesota. That will be the Sparks' third of five consecutive road games. Then they'll finish the regular season with four games in a row at home. Los Angeles already has clinched a playoff spot; what's left is where the Sparks -- now in second place at 19-8 -- finish in the West and how that propels them into the postseason. Beard went to the playoffs three times while in Washington, losing in the conference semifinals in each trip. She didn't win an NCAA title at Duke, nor has she had even a sniff of the chance to play in the WNBA Finals. She knows this L.A. team has the potential to do that, but just as with her own comeback, she is cautiously optimistic. ""I think we still have a long ways to go in terms of becoming a championship team,"" Beard said. ""We can become more consistent. ""Every athlete steps into their season saying they want a championship. I would love a championship. But for the first time ever, I feel like it's really in our sights. We all have to go through Minnesota, because they have it. And other teams are playing well. But it's about us -- if we come out on the court and do what we can do to the best of our ability, we have a good shot at it."" And for Beard, after the odyssey of the ankle, just having a shot is all she could ask for. She has certainly earned that much.",Raw Data
52,"FORT WORTH, Texas There was little of interest in the basketball game between TCU and SMU last week, a theory of mine confirmed within minutes of arrival. The national anthem was playing when I walked in; a danger of traveling with a 3-year-old is you are just barely on time for everything, no matter how early you leave. It turned out not to matter. Hardly anybody was there. Half empty is a generous description of the crowd. Quiet was accurate. And then 12 seconds into the game, a kid from TCU went down with what was obviously a season-ending knee injury and the atmosphere became somber, so freaking depressing even my kid noticed and said, ""What happened?"" Afterward, the Horned Frog players were leaving the press conference room and the SMU coach was walking in and he stopped to say, ""I'm sorry about your teammate, guys."" It was just the right thing to say, and nothing about it was forced or insincere. The coach expounded on the thought after sitting down: ""It made me sick to my stomach seeing that, a great player like that, a big part of this program Look at what they lost tonight. It's a killer."" This is why I am here, the thing that makes this game interesting. The 72-year-old basketball coach for SMU is Larry Brown. Yes, that Larry Brown of Kansas national championship, Pacers, Sixers and Pistons fame. There also was that year with the Knicks and the time with the Bobcats. And now he is coaching Southern Methodist, a basketball team in a football state. The Mustangs are 5-0, off to their best start since 1997-98, when they won their first 10 games. I came with 1,000 questions for him about Isiah Thomas, about why Phil Jackson would want to come back and why LA did not want him, about Kansas. But after 40 minutes of typical college basketball, I had only one left. What are you doing here? This question is hardly original. Brown has been asked it in varying forms 1,000 times since taking the SMU job. What brought you back? Why SMU? Why not stay retired? But the real question isn't what brought him back. Because he's not back. This is not the NBA or Calipari's roster of assassins. This is an overhaul in half-empty arenas watching 18-year-olds trade mistakes to determine who is going to lose the game. So why are you here? ""I never worked,"" Brown said. I got the feeling this is his stock answer. It is also B.S. Coaches love to say they stay in coaching because they love it. Yet listen as Bill Parcells calls coaching a ""killer profession"" or as Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer talks about how he enjoyed his time away or as Saint Louis University announces that coach Rick Majerus will not be returning because of health reasons. Coaches cannot stay away, though; the game keeps pulling them back in even if the returns are diminishing. ""Games are tough, but not being around kids, not being at games is tougher. I really mean that,"" Brown acknowledged. ""I tried not to do it. I can't see myself not doing it. Why pretend?"" He looked not much different than his days at Kansas, working refs and stalking the sidelines. The only changes were born of how much time he had been away, 24 years since he last patrolled the sidelines of a college court. In his first game back, against Loyola Marymount, it became a joke. The refs kept having to remind him to stay in the box. It was so comical they were laughing. ""They have a coaching box in the NBA, but that is for guys like me, not Phil Jackson. I'm constantly going over,"" Brown said. ""I'm figuring out how much I forgot. I don't know about these timeouts. They have more timeouts than the NBA. There's a lot of things I am learning, but I have a great staff."" The Mustangs staff is the most NBA thing about the game. They had 17 guys in suits, which the Texas Christian staff informed me is a Daniel-Meyer Coliseum record. One of them is the ""coach-in-waiting,"" Brown's hand-picked successor, former Illinois State coach Tim Jankovich. There are some who say that is why Brown is back. Others say it is for the money, like this is a bad thing or somehow unique among athletes or coaches. We are all doing things for money. They are just doing it for more money. And I do not think that is the only thing for which Brown is doing it. He has a lot of money, and it is almost impossible to fake his energy as he talked to me. He really was crazy excited about these three kids they had signed a day earlier, going through their names and what they were going to bring to the team. That is the danger, of course, when you bring back the guy who just cannot stay away. Will the guy put in the work? Or is he just cashing a check as Mavericks owner Mark Cuban famously (and rightly) accused Don Nelson of so long ago? Is he back because he burns for the job? Or does he not know what else to do? Time will tell. It always does. One cannot fake coaching the demands are too much, especially for a project as big as SMU. What I know for sure is anybody can come back to a plush Lakers job or a sweet college gig. You have to really love things to be here, coaching in front of empty seats and trying to do something that may not be possible. ""I've had disappointments in my career of coaching but very few,"" Brown said. ""Being around players, coaches makes up for anything."" That is why he is here. Even if we cannot understand it.",Raw Data
53,"LOS ANGELES Inevitably, if you are fortunate enough to have a father you revere live long enough, there comes a time where you have to begin searching for reminders of the man you once knew. They gradually become obscured by uncertainty, frailty and other diminishing curses of age, which no amount of determination can seem to beat back. Now, imagine that you are not only this mans son, but his boss, too. That is the circumstance USC coach Lane Kiffin is in right now, where the wrath for the preseason No. 1 Trojans collapse has found an inviting, and perhaps accurate, target: his 72-year-old defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin. After Oregon ran roughshod over the Trojans on national television Saturday for 62 points and 730 yards, school records for futility that came on the heels of a late defensive collapse in a defeat at Arizona, the younger Kiffin is being besieged by calls to fire his father. Its one thing for people to suggest you take away the keys to your dads car. Its another to demand that you take away the ones to his office. The younger Kiffin says he will evaluate his father just as he does any other coach, an assertion that no matter how real will always be met with skepticism. Asked if he was pleased with his dads work this season, Kiffin said: Of course not. You cant give up historic numbers, record-breaking numbers and be satisfied. But, he added, as the head coach, it falls on me too. Im not going to sit here and say, 'Well, Im in charge of the offense and were scoring [51 points].' Well wait to see the whole thing. Weve played 5 1/2 terrible quarters of defense. Wed played good defense most of the year. As frustrating as the end of the game was, and the game before, lets see what happens this Saturday [against Arizona State]. This is not what was expected four years ago, when Lane Kiffin, fresh off being fired by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis, landed the University of Tennessee job. One of the reasons he was hired was the promise that he could bring his father, one of the NFLs most respected assistant coaches, with him a move endorsed by Peyton Manning. Father-son working relationships are hardly uncommon in football Phillips (Bum, Wade), Ryan (Buddy, Rex, Rob), Shanahan (Mike, Kyle), Bowden (Bobby, Terry, Jeff) Paterno (Joe, Jay) and Schottenheimer (Marty, Brian) are among the fathers and sons who have worked together. But almost exclusively it is the father employing the son, able to shelter him while he gains experience even if it means having to answer the uncomfortable, but reasonable, questions of nepotism. That dynamic has been flipped with the Kiffins. It seemed as if there would be a benefit in Kiffin working for his father, that he would have a mentor and someone who would be quick to recognize his mistakes. Monte Kiffin is, in many respects, everything that his son is not. If Lane can be brash, immature and sometimes incapable of getting out of his own way (the tiff with Urban Meyer to banning a reporter from practice for reporting a players surgery), Monte goes about life with his head down, oblivious to the outside world a quality that in a previous generation of football circles was admired. Hes all football and hes been all football forever, Lane Kiffin said Wednesday. He might not be able to tell you there was a presidential election yesterday. Really, he might not. Near the end of practice Wednesday, Monte Kiffin, wearing shorts, layered in T-shirts and with a baseball cap pulled down on leathered brow, meandered around the field. While other coaches sprinted or jogged with their players, Monte walked with a tilted gait, his shoulders rocking from side to side, breaking into a trot only to leave the field for a few minutes in the direction of the bathrooms. But is the sort of symbolism that paints Kiffin as worn and over the hill fair? As haggard as Monte Kiffin looked Saturday night, it was his schemes and players who throttled Oregon for three quarters in Eugene last season, a loss that knocked the Ducks out of the national championship chase and prompted Oregon coach Chip Kelly to seek out the elder Kiffin in the USC locker room afterward to congratulate him. On Saturday, the Ducks adjusted. They ran three plays the Trojans had not seen on film and their line was the best USC coaches could remember. Lane Kiffin said the defensive coaches did not adjust well. Asked if his father has slipped, Lane Kiffin said: No. Thats part of what happens. Theyre not asking about Bill Snyders age, the unbeaten Kansas State coach is 73 because theyre not turning the ball over and theyre playing really good. They ask about your age when you lose. Kiffin says that, as a son, the blame being directed at his father does not bother him. He suggests that his dad probably feels worse, since it is a fathers instinct no matter at what stage in life to want to protect his child, something Monte has done this week by eagerly owning the blame for the defense. For his part, Monte Kiffin said he ignores all the noise, which for USC at the moment is not unlike every week for every losing team in the NFL. But even for someone who has spent four decades in the NFL, who has been fired and hired many times, this has to feel like something different. After Arizona State on Saturday, there are still games against UCLA and Notre Dame, and perhaps another date with Oregon, opportunities for resurgence, or further embarrassment. Its one thing to be asked to turn in your keys, its another to be asked by your son. And thats something that one way or another, its hard to imagine the father will let happen.",Raw Data

55,"FOX race analyst Larry McReynolds has more than 30 years of NASCAR experience as a mechanic, Daytona 500-winning crew chief and broadcaster. He earned 23 Cup wins as a crew chief, including two victories in the prestigious Daytona 500, as well as a pair of non-points victories in the annual all-star race. Honestly, as much as people wanted to build up the storyline that Jeff Gordon and Clint Bowyer were not done with each other after their altercation at Phoenix, with NASCAR coming down on them a little bit this week it seemed clear it would not continue at Homestead. At Phoenix, the two had contact on the track then Gordon retaliated and sparked a wreck that took out himself, Bowyer and Joey Logano. Bowyer’s crew then continued the confrontation with Gordon in the garage and Bowyer himself headed to Gordon’s transporter on foot before being turned away by officials. Both then were invited for a chat with NASCAR officials. Last week, NASCAR not only came down on Jeff Gordon with a fine, but probably had some serious conversations with Jeff, with team owner Rick Hendrick, with Clint, with team owner Michael Waltrip, ensuring that all of that would stay in Phoenix because these guys still had a strong task at hand. Obviously, Jeff Gordon was trying to get a second win in 2012 and Clint Bowyer was trying to maybe finish second in the points - and both goals were accomplished Sunday. Gordon got his second Cup win of the year which, honestly, when you look at the season that he had this year, to win two races – I’m not sure that wipes out all the weird things that happened to him. But there are a lot of drivers that would love to have had two wins this year, for example the guy that led the most laps Sunday, Kyle Busch. For Clint Bowyer to have a season where, with a brand-new race team, his first year at Michael Waltrip Racing, he won three races and finished second in the points. Honestly, I’ve got to believe, the furthest thing from the minds of those two drivers on Sunday was getting back at each other. Now Gordon heads into the offseason as the final winner of the year. He and his Hendrick Motorsports team have run well this year. They’ve had some great runs. They were in position to win a lot more races than just the two they did win. But Jeff Gordon continues to prove that he can still win races, can still contend for championships and if they can just put some of the bad luck that happened to them this year behind them, I wouldn’t be a bit surprised to see Jeff Gordon basically contending for a championship next year.",Raw Data
56,"Greg Couch has been a national columnist at AOL Fanhouse and The Sporting News and an award-winning columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was featured twice in “Best American Sports Writing” and was recognized this year by the US Tennis Writers Association for best column writing and match coverage. He covers tennis on his personal blog. The problem with people who talk and write for a living is that they always have to say something. Have to. It has to be loud, too, if they want to get hits online or ratings on TV. The formula? Inflame an issue quickly, then boil it down to sound bites that can be defined in clear, black-and-white, up-or-down points against the person sitting at the other side of the table. Caroline Wozniacki wore towels under her clothes to perform an impression of Serena Williams during a match in Brazil. Andre Penner They are always looking for something, anything, as jumping-off points to start a five-alarm fire. That’s how Caroline Wozniacki was set up Tuesday. She was the patsy in a bogus modern-media frenzy. She innocently, jokingly impersonated her friend, Serena Williams, at a tennis exhibition in Brazil. She used a towel to pad her chest to cartoon levels, and another one to pad her rear end. It was possibly racially insensitive, or possibly just funny. Did I mention race? That was the jumping-off point for Twitter, bloggers and even “The View.’’ Wozniacki was labeled a racist, and it went viral. International. And it was unfair. Her little act was not racist. Insensitive, maybe, but not racist. “You can make as much fun as you want to,’’ Whoopi Goldberg said on “The View.’’ “She’s still going to beat your ass.’’ Yes, anger sells. But in this case, it was created. Williams and Wozniacki actually have quite a different relationship than it might seem based on Goldberg’s comments. At the U.S. Open last year, someone asked Williams about boyfriend-advice she had given Wozniacki: “Well, I told her never look through the guy’s phone,’’ Williams said. “That is the worst thing you can do. I told her most relationships end. It wasn’t very good advice.’’ When Williams was sick with blood clots in her lungs and home scared for her life, Wozniacki dropped by her home in Los Angeles to comfort her. If you look at it out of context, without one tiny bit of research or reporting, this impersonation can be turned into a bitter moment. It was not one. In fact, Wozniacki did a similar impersonation last year that didn’t seem to bother anyone, including Williams. And when Wozniacki did her impression at the exhibition in Brazil, Williams reportedly was in the audience. Part of the problem is that you have Williams fans who are not tennis fans. For people who don’t know, this probably comes across as someone taking a cold shot at Williams. Maybe they don’t realize that tennis players mimic other players all the time. Every tennis fan has seen video of Novak Djokovic’s on-court impersonations of Maria Sharapova and other players. He did an entire commercial for Head tennis racquets in a blonde wig, ending by saying, “My name is Maria Sharapova and my game is instinct.’’ You can’t expect everyone to understand. But it would be nice if talkers and analysts did, or at least studied up. There was nothing mean-spirited about Wozniacki’s impression. She was not suggesting that Williams is overweight, or that there is anything wrong with Williams’ body-type. Williams has called herself “bootylicious’’ and talked about her extra “assets.’’ Wozniacki was not insulting the look, but playing it up, like “vavavoom.’’ She was just messing around with her friend, and with Sharapova, who she was playing at the time. Wozniacki tries to turn moments light-hearted all the time. In Australia, she showed up at a news conference with a plastic kangaroo after joking that a kangaroo had attacked her. She once tried to sneak up behind Sharapova in an interview and pop a balloon to scare her on camera. True, there may be a difference here in that those were harmless jokes and this is a sensitive issue that goes to the heart of body image and African-American women. But this was not a statement about black women or their body types. If anything, Wozniacki was making fun of Sharapova, as in “Don’t make me go all Serena on you.’’ Williams and Sharapova are the best rivalry in women’s tennis, and Williams has been crushing Sharapova all year. Goldberg threw out the topic on “The View,’’ saying that some people are calling Wozniacki a racist. Then, she and Sherri Shepherd expressed anger over the impersonation, and they never shot down the word racist. They were clearly agreeing with it. “What’s interesting to me,’’ Goldberg said, “is that that visual is generally seen with a bone in their nose, and a short little skirt like she’s got on. And that’s why people see it as being somewhat racist, because it’s an image that we have seen before. “And I don’t ever remember them making fun of any of the white tennis players. ... I’m just sort of curious. Why Serena? What is it about her? ""Is it her color? Is it the fact she’s not 4 inches wide and weighs 6 ounces, and can beat all of their asses with her eyes closed?’’ Look, Goldberg is bringing up a serious issue, but she’s picking the wrong moment, inflaming because they needed something to talk about. Not only that, but Goldberg referred to Wozniacki as “Carol.’’ If she doesn’t know the name of a recent, long-time No. 1 player, then why would it matter if she doesn’t remember people making fun of white players? I’ve written about the racial divide between Sharapova and Williams. It is partly about the love shown to Sharapova, who is tall, blonde, white magazine-cover/tennis “ideal.’’ She gets more endorsement money than Williams, who is a better player but not fitting the “ideal.’’ Want to know who supports the best players in the game? Check out these wives and girlfriends. I put that in quotes because the ideal is actually a dangerous size 0. Williams has worked miracles over the years to shoot down that ideal, showing young girls that a different body type can be sexy, beautiful and fit. And win Wimbledon and Olympic gold. So I’m on board with Goldberg in the argument, but it doesn’t fit this moment. Wozniacki was not denigrating Williams or her dress size. Was it insensitive? Well, she is a blonde woman fitting the “ideal'' too, and doing something that evoked a way in which black female bodies have traditionally been mocked and caricatured. Maybe that’s just too much imagery. That was Shepherd’s point on “The View”: “I know they’re friends, but it’s still, inside it does something to me because we’ve been made fun of for so long for different parts of our body. And to see Serena Williams reduced to this, I don’t like it. I know they’re friends, I know.’’ For Wozniacki, this just might be one of those things you can’t do. She might have crossed a line. She should probably ask her friend about it. But from a line of insensitivity to worldwide racist? That’s just too much talk.",Raw Data
57,"Eurosport - Great Britain's Steven Burke, Edward Clancy, Samuel Harrison and Andrew Tennant compete during the men's team pursuit at the 2013 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Minsk (Reuters) The Australian quartet of Glenn O'Shea, Alexander Edmondson, Michael Hepburn and Alexander Morgan completed the 4,000 metres at the wooden velodrome in the Belarus capital in three minutes 56.751 seconds to clinch the gold medal. However, the result was well short of the world record of 3:51.659, set by the British at the London Games last August. Britain only had two riders, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy, returning from London, with newcomers Samuel Harrison and Andrew Tennant replacing Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh. The new quartet could only manage the time of 4:00.967 in the final. Denmark beat Spain in the consolation final to win the bronze in 3:59.821. Earlier, American Sarah Hammer won her fifth world title in the women's individual pursuit over 3,000 metres while France's Francois Pervis clinched his first in another non-Olympic event - the men's one kilometre time trial. Hammer crushed Australia's Amy Cure in the final by more than eight seconds, coming home in three minutes 32.050 seconds, with another Australian Annette Edmondson taking the bronze. Hammer, who also won in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2011, did not compete at last year's championships in Melbourne. The 29-year-old, who lost the Olympic gold medal in the omnium in London by a single point, said she did not plan a big celebration. ""I'm just going to call my parents at home, that's about it. I'll have a day's rest tomorrow, then get ready for more races on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,"" she said."" Pervis won the time trial, which was dropped from the Olympic programme after the 2004 Games in Athens, in one minute 00.221 seconds, with Simon Van Velthooven of New Zealand finishing second, 0.648 seconds behind, and German Joachim Eilers taking the bronze. British team newcomer Kian Emadi just missed out on a medal in an event that six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy once dominated; Emadi's time of 1.01.756 was just over three tenths of a second slower than Eilers. ""I was stressed out, staying at the hotel and waiting for the championships to start. But finally, I'm a world champion,"" said 28-year-old Pervis, who was not selected for the French Olympic team in London."" ""I hope to win another medal in keirin on Friday. I was second in 2009 but I'll try to go for the gold this time."" Germany won the last gold medal on offer on the opening night of the five-day championships, taking the women's team sprint title by edging out China in the final by just three hundredths of a second. Britain finished third ahead of Australia as Becky James produced a brilliant ride as she partnered teenager Vicky Williamson to bronze."" James, a double European junior champion when she last competed in Minsk four years ago, is due a busy weekend in the absence of the injured Jess Varnish and retired Victoria Pendleton. And the 21-year old sprinter is clearly in top form, as Germany retained the title they won in Melbourne, edging out China in a repeat of last year's Olympic final ""I'm in the best form but this medal is still so unexpected, I'm shocked really, totally gobsmacked,"" said James, who saw her Olympic dreams ruined by an untimely bout of appendicitis."" ""We came in with no expectations because we're a new line-up but I knew my form was coming through and to get on that podium is so encouraging."" ""I've got plenty of events to come and after all the things that went wrong last year, it's just great that things are going right now."" ""My training has been so consistent and that's the simple reason for my form. I've not raced this well since the Commonwealth Games in Delhi.""",Raw Data
58,"A late goal by Aydin Yilmaz gave Galatasaray a 2-1 win over Braga and sent the Turkish club into the Champions League knockout stage for the first time in 11 years on Wednesday. Galatasaray was level on points with Cluj going into the last Group H games and needed a win in Portugal to beat the Romanian club to second place and advance behind group winner Manchester United. Galatasaray and Cluj each have 10 points but the Turkish club has head-to-head advantage, sending the Romanian team into the Europa League. Braga finished bottom of the group with three points and is out of European football. Galatasaray was fortunate to claim its third group win after a blunder-filled performance in northern Portugal that made Braga look the likely winner, even though Burak Yilmaz also hit the goal-frame in an improved late spell for the visitor. Aydin Yilmaz scored the winner in the 78th, 20 minutes after Burak Yilmaz equalized with his sixth Champions League goal. Marcio Mossoro broke the deadlock in the 32nd with a low shot from the edge of the area. Mossoro, Eder and Paulo Vinicius were poised to capitalize on the visitor's defensive mistakes but squandered opportunities from close range in the opening 15 minutes. Galatasaray made some promising moves down the left flank but seldom made significant progress and was repeatedly backpedalling after losing the ball.",Raw Data

60,"On the more exacting Torrey Pines South course — which played two shots harder than the shorter North — a round of 4-under par represented a very good start for Woods. He has won seven times here but none since the scandal. Even though Woods could have shot much lower — he had six birdies and an eagle — only four players on the South bettered him, which left Woods satisfied despite a sloppy finish. “A 68 on the South,” he declared, “Is a good number.” But there was more to Thursday’s round than just a number. For stretches, Woods looked, dare it be said, like the Old Tiger. And it wasn’t just his play that said so, but his demeanor. When he was at his best, he carried an aura of imperiousness. He was never in any doubt as to whether he would play well; the only question was how well. Since the scandal, that self-assuredness hasn’t been as obvious. “I knew he was going to play well today,” said Woods’ caddie, Joe LaCava. “I don’t know if it’s because he’s very comfortable here, but I could see it on the range this morning when we were warming up. His tempo looked good, and he was moving the ball both ways. “I always know he’s going to play well when he shapes it easily both ways on the range.” LaCava’s instincts were validated immediately. Woods found a fairway bunker on the first hole — a relatively benign par 4 he managed to butcher during his 2008 US Open victory here — but drained a 20 footer for birdie. And that’s important, too, because Woods back in the day was deadly from that range. “I think he could’ve played quite a bit better,” said Rickie Fowler, who plays socially with Woods in Florida and was paired with him on Thursday. “But when he was on the greens, he definitely took advantage.” Woods, who is three shots off the lead shared by K.J. Choi and Brandt Snedeker, missed left off the tee early, but it didn’t get him into trouble until the brutal fourth, nestled along the Pacific. From an awkward, side-hill stance in the rough, Woods hit a poor approach, chipped on, then three-putted for double bogey. But Woods rebounded immediately with a birdie on the next, then recalled that 2008 US Open when he holed his greenside bunker shot for eagle on the par-5 sixth. “It was more important to get that birdie right out of the way (on the fifth) and get back to even par with the par 5 to play,” Woods said. “I knew I had two par 5s on the front side to go, so I could get it under par and then maybe get two or three on the back. I thought that would be a good score. “And, lo and behold, I got it rolling.” That he did, with birdies on eight, nine, 12 and 13. “Got it to 6 (under par) and had a chance to get to 7,” he said. But the putt on the 14th slid agonizingly by the hole. It seemed, at the time, just a minor inconvenience. He was playing so well it seemed inevitable that he would tie for the lead. But then came a reminder that resurrection for Tiger Woods won’t be easy. An errant tee shot to the right of 15 left him behind a tree and resulted in a bogey after a bad chip. Another poor chip on 17 led to another bogey. Woods layed up on the closing par 5, but from 95 yards sailed a lob wedge over the green and into a bunker. He needed to hole an 8-footer for par just to stay at 4 under. “I hit a beautiful putt to get it to 7 (under), and I get up and down on 18 to get to 4,” he shrugged, “I made a few mistakes out there, but I made some nice plays, as well.” Woods and LaCava explained the turnaround given last week’s missed cut in Abu Dhabi. “I think last week really was just a lack of playing,” LaCava said. “You can practice all you want, but you need the competition.” Woods agreed, to a point. “It does help to play after having six weeks off,” he said. “Unfortunately, it was only a couple of rounds, but it was still nice to get a feel for it. “It wasn’t really a lot different than how I hit it last week. Last week’s conditions were a lot more difficult, and the fairways were narrow and the wind was howling. I felt like I was doing a lot of good things last week. And I came out here today and basically did the same thing.”",Raw Data

Spencer has lent her expertise to both television and radio and is a regular contributor to SiriusXM Radio and the Performance Racing Network. Chip Ganassi continued to make magic — and history — at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday. Juan Pablo Montoya held off Max Angelelli to deliver Ganassi a record-breaking fifth Rolex 24 at Daytona victory. The Chip Ganassi Racing team’s accomplishment also enabled Scott Pruett to secure his fifth overall Rolex win to tie the record held by Hurley Haywood. The victory is also Pruett’s fifth in the Daytona Prototype (DP) Class, his fourth with Ganassi and his 10th career victory among all classes. See the best photos from the Rolex 24 at Daytona. “It’s unbelievable,” Pruett said. “When you look at what we’ve been able to achieve, it’s been nothing short of incredible. . . . To win with these guys, to win with Chip, with Telmex, with BMW, and then at the end of it, having gotten to know Hurley real well over the years by racing with him and just as a friend, and to have him there at the end was pretty special, very special thing.” Ganassi was humbled by last year’s Rolex 24, when neither of his teams made podium appearances as Ford swept the top three spots in the DP class. That forced the organization to go to work. Ganassi acknowledged “it was a big effort” for the company. “There are lots of things on these cars,” Ganassi said. “These are not spec cars. These are cars you can make changes with, whether on the wing, the toes, the brakes, the shocks, lots of things you can work with on these cars that really helps you develop mechanical grip. And I think that’s what we worked most on. “We wanted to give those guys every opportunity to win, as well, and we thought the 02 car was obviously very strong . . . so we thought we had two good shots at it here, and we did until earlier today.” With the performance of the BMWs, it was clear from a power standpoint that Ganassi had the field covered. Although the No. 01 developed brake issues just before noon, when Ganassi’s No. 02 car developed mechanical issues and stopped on the course, the caution enabled the No. 01 team to fix the problem. Montoya relieved Pruett at 1:43 p.m. ET for the final stint and took the lead from Marcos Ambrose three minutes later, when the defending championship car pitted and changed drivers with AJ Allmendinger taking the wheel. On a caution for debris with just more than an hour remaining, Allmendinger took the lead out of the pits with Montoya, Joao Barbosa, Max Angelelli and Ricky Taylor rounding out the top five at 2:20 p.m. Six minutes and four laps later, Montoya took back the lead. He held the point for six additional minutes before a caution flag for debris only delayed the inevitable if Montoya’s car stayed intact. When action resumed at 2:41 p.m., Angelelli led Montoya to the restart, and Barbosa forced Allmendinger off the course and received a penalty for avoidable contact. Allmendinger took the opportunity to top off his Michael Shank Racing Ford and cycled out to fourth behind Angelelli, Barbosa and Montoya. Barbosa finally pitted at 2:48 p.m. and served his one-minute penalty, allowing Allmendinger to advance to third.",Raw Data
62,"League One Brentford twice took the lead as they threatened a major shock, but cup holders Chelsea responded to keep themselves in the competition. Marcello Trotta, who is on loan from Fulham, gave Brentford a deserved half-time lead only for Oscar to draw Chelsea level with a fine solo effort early in the second half. Harry Forrester restored Brentford's lead from the penalty spot on 73 minutes after Ross Turnbull brought down Tom Adeyemi. However, Torres had the final word as his superb curling effort from the edge of the box seven minutes from time spared Chelsea's blushes. Fit-again John Terry started his first game under Rafa Benitez but it was almost a nightmare return when Turnbull was penalised for clutching his captain's backpass. Turnbull's refusal to release the ball for a quick indirect free-kick could hardly have been more ironic in the wake of the Eden Hazard saga, Forrester eventually blazing over the crossbar. Brentford made the breakthrough three minutes before half-time when Adam Forshaw's sliding tackle robbed Frank Lampard and Forrester unleashed a shot Turnbull needlessly parried straight to Trotta, who fired in the rebound. There was plenty of time for Chelsea to get their act together and it took them only 10 minutes into the second half to do so, Oscar pouncing on a loose clearance and bamboozling the Brentford defence before drilling into the top corner. But Brentford refused to panic, drawing Chelsea's sting before withdrawing Trotta for Adeyemi with 20 minutes remaining. It was inspired, the substitute winning a penalty almost immediately after being upended by Turnbull after racing on to Clayton Donaldson's brilliant through ball. Turnbull might have seen red but escaped with a booking before Forrester buried the spot-kick right in the bottom-left corner. Substitute Demba Ba made the difference, challenging for an 83rd-minute ball that fell to Torres, who instinctively curled it into the top corner from 18 yards. Lampard went close to a winner and Mata appealed furiously for handball in the box against Harlee Dean but that would have been a travesty of justice.",Raw Data

""I think to beat Agnieszka here it means something more because she's defending champion, so she's playing well here,"" said Kvitova, who has a 4-1 record against the Pole. ""So that's a good sign for me."" Kvitova had 38 unforced errors against Radwanska and said she would have to play better against Wozniacki. ""I am a player who is going for the winners, so I have to accept the unforced errors, too,"" she said. ""I shoot bullets on the court next time."" Wozniacki was almost untouchable in the second set, and the third went back-and-fourth. Bartoli jumped ahead 2-0 and then Wozniacki ran off five straight games. Bartoli won two straight to make it 5-4 but Wozniacki was able to hang on and serve out the Advertisement match. Afterward, Diego Maradona, an ambassador for the Dubai Sports Council, came onto the court to give her one of his signed Argentina jerseys emblazoned with his No. 10. The Dane gave the soccer great a signed tennis racket. ""It was disappointing to lose that first set after I had been up,"" Wozniacki said. ""But then I felt like she couldn't really do much in that second set because I was all over it."" Vinci put away Stosur, who lost in the quarterfinals in Doha last week following a second-round exit at her home Australian Open. Stosur made 28 unforced errors and was broken twice in each set. ""Way too many errors,"" Stosur said. ""She did well to not be bothered by anything I was trying to do. She used her slice very well which kept all the points neutral."" Despite the latest setback, Stosur felt she was improving over her dismal start to the year. ""January didn't really go as well as I wanted it to. I wasn't playing up to the standard and level that I think I'm capable of,"" she said. ""The last couple of weeks, it's gotten better. I've played many more good matches than bad."" Vinci also ousted sixth-ranked Angelique Kerber. Her coach told her to attack Stosur's backhand. ""She has an unbelievable forehand, so I tried to play against her backhand because she has a lot of problem with backhand, and try some slice and also some top when I have time,"" Vinci said. Vinci said her success in doubles — the Italian has 19 doubles titles to only seven singles — has contributed to her resurgence in singles, where she was ranked 17th. ""In doubles, you can try something that you can play in singles,"" she said. ""I probably play more relaxed and then I play better in the singles.""",Raw Data

66,"Ernest Hemingway used to call the people who loved bullfighting “aficionados.” I think the people who loved the NBA back when I started doing games in the ’70s were aficionados. They were great, knowledgeable fans – there just weren’t a lot of them. The NBA was not a household game. Everybody knew basketball and, of course, they knew who the marquee teams were and paid attention to the Finals. But regular-season NBA games, for the most part, drew only aficionados. Now the whole world understands the NBA, the whole world watches the NBA, the whole world follows the NBA and that’s why we’re here – in London – to play this game tonight between the Pistons and the Knicks. It’s amazing that we’re playing a game in London, but what’s more amazing is that as far as the NBA is concerned today, this is business as usual. It happens every season that games are played internationally, whether it’s regular season or preseason, and since this is a regular-season game, it counts as much as any other, no matter where it’s played. I had never been to London before and I knew it was going to be a somewhat grueling trip over here, so I did what you’re supposed to do – stay up all day after you get here and don’t go to sleep until that evening. I feel pretty good, so I hope our players do, too. What a great city London truly is. It reminds me of New York. I always thought nothing could be on par with New York as far as my favorite city, but London is right there. It’s an amazing place and it’s a privilege to be here. It’s been an educational trip for me. I had a chance to go to Westminster Abbey and to Buckingham Palace and also to Churchill’s underground war museum, where he and all the military leaders during World War II were bunkered as Hitler bombed London. The history there is mind-boggling. And we have people like Winston Churchill and, over in the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt to thank for getting us through World War II. It doesn’t ever hurt to be reminded of that. There’s a certain feel here in London that’s so multicultural and everybody is just blasé about it. It’s really a melting pot beyond all melting pots, maybe anywhere else in the world. That’s basically what the USA is all about, but it’s interesting to see where outside of our shores people from all over the world congregate and London is certainly that place. It gives you a realization that maybe it’s not so far-fetched that someday there will be a team here or a team that plays some of its games here. You’d have to rearrange the schedule a little bit. We know the Pistons’ early-season schedule was tortuous because they had to give us breathing room around this trip to London. That’s why the Pistons played more games than anybody else early in the season. But you could see how it would be possible to have more than just a game per season played here in London. When you’re playing the New York Knicks on an international stage, it makes it for all intents and purposes more than just a game. You certainly want to play well and getting a victory would be terrific with most of the world watching. The Pistons are a team that has won seven of their last 10 games. They’re pretty much back to where probably I thought they’d be when the season started – a team that has a legitimate chance to make a run at the playoffs. I would have been surprised if the Pistons had been hopelessly out of it – and they’re not. I think this will be a recurring theme from now until the playoffs begin. Will the Pistons make it and, if so, in what spot? I don’t think you’ll look at this Detroit team and say we can cross them off the list. This team has too much talent, too many good players. They might not have the superstars yet that some others have, but there’s an awful lot of ability up and down this roster, which has been proven by the play off the bench. If you look at the franchises in the league that have won multiple championships, you of course focus on the Lakers and the Celtics and then the Bulls. And these days, you’ve got to think of San Antonio with the run Gregg Popovich has had. After that, one of the elite franchises is the Pistons. The Knicks also have multiple titles if you look at the two they won in the ’70s and the Pistons, of course, have three – the two the Bad Boys won and the Goin’ to Work gang’s 2004 title. So it’s appropriate the Pistons and the Knicks are playing this game in London. Both franchises deserve to be here. I hope we can give London a great game. Related Articles: George Blaha",Raw Data

We made some tweaks at halftime and then late in the game in the last six minutes like we do versus most special players, we blitzed his pin downs, his pick-and-rolls, his dribble hand-offs. Charlie read a great one. It just knocked off of his hand. Redick was great but I thought big baby was really good. In that run we just individually had a very, very hard time trying to guard him. E’Twaun Moore comes off the bench and gives them a huge lift. Defensively, it wasn’t one of our better efforts but I’m proud of our guys, the grit they showed, and I’m happy we came out with the ‘W’.” Pistons Forward Tayshaun Prince “Every game is a must win game for us from this point on if we want to have a shot at trying to make the playoffs. We have to continue to take one game at a time. We did feel that we really wanted to come out and get this one because they beat us pretty well the first two times that they played us. We really wanted to come out and be aggressive and we got off to a great start. JJ got rolling early and they kind of fed off of that. Nobody else really had a rhythm for them in the first half, which allowed us to have a 10 point lead at halftime. The other guys picked it up in the second half, but Wil Bynum did a great job of setting up Brandon. Brandon was making some tough shots for us and even when he missed some shots, he was able to take the next one with the confidence he was playing with.” “Baby struggled in the first half. He struggled against us in Detroit the last time we played. He got off to a great start in the fourth and made some plays getting into the paint. For the most part, Brandon was our savior tonight and Wil was our savior at the start of the fourth. Kim was unbelievable for us in a situation where a guy that doesn’t get any minutes, to depend on him to guard a guy (Redick) who is already hot. It is a tough situation to be in.” Pistons Center Greg Monroe “They (Magic) always play hard. JJ Redick was on fire obviously. Big Baby picked up in the second half. When you have two guys like those guys going, and Jameer who is always solid at the point guard position, they are a good underrated team. They play hard, so whenever you play hard you always put yourself in position to win games.” “Many games are won in the fourth quarter. You have to be able to get stops going down the stretch and make the most of your possessions. It is something that we did tonight.” (on whether Pistons can catch Celtics for #8 seed due to news about Rondo season ending injury) “Our goal is to win as many games as possible to try and get into the playoffs. It is unfortunate for him (Rondo). I never wish an injury on any player. That is something with or without him we have to do our job anyway.” “You have to commend him (Kim English) for being ready. He definitely was ready and played good defense. He made some tough buckets. He has always prepared himself and I wasn’t surprised with anything he did tonight.” Pistons Guard Brandon Knight “Throughout the entire game you are going to have plays that are going to go in your favor or not go in your favor. Tonight we had a lot of plays in which we got the 50/50 balls and we were able to close out the game. The ball bounces funny sometimes and you have to get some of those bounces and make some of those effort plays. I have to commend my teammates for making those effort plays towards the end of the game.” “You always want to go home on a win although we know we let a couple games (during road trip) slip away before that.” (on career high w/ 31 points) “I have to commend my teammates who did a great job of looking for me and seeing I was making shots. A lot of it came from them trying to create for me.” “Will does a great job on pick-and-rolls, getting into the paint and drawing the defense. He does a great job of making reads and making the right plays. He did that throughout the fourth quarter.” Magic Head Coach Jacque Vaughn (On end of game, another close, tough loss): “We tried. We tried. The coaches and I were talking about if we were going to leave Glen in because we were going to press after that and still foul and send them to the free throw line. We decided to leave him in, just in case Jameer missed it. He comes away with the rebound, big fella, I think Nik had an opportunity, Jameer. Great effort, you got to give them credit, though, for their approach tonight, but I thought we did some good things. Great effort at the end.” (On Arron not playing at end, E’Twaun being in the game): “Arron experienced a slight left calf strain, so that went into the equation. So, we’ll see how he feels tomorrow. But that was the major reason why I decided to go with ‘E’ (E’Twaun) down the stretch.” I think there was one possession, I think Knight ends up hitting a three, and those are the possessions that, for us to win we have to win those possessions. I mean at the end of the day we have to come away with that rebound with that ball, that loose ball, that 50/50 ball. Somehow, someway and that’s important to us for us to win.” Was that your decision for Jameer to miss the third free throw at end?: “It was not. We had almost seven seconds left. We had a play that could get us a shot in seven seconds so I think we were in good shape. No it wasn’t. We got a chance to get a rebound we wanted to make that.” (On JJ in starting lineup recently): “It makes it tough for us to, size-wise, that they’re both at times guarding different guys, but tonight E’Twaun’s guarding Tayshaun Prince so everyone’s a part of the equation. I think it’s produced some numbers across the board. I think last game we had six guys in double figures. This game we have five guys in double figures so I think that the floor’s spread, the ball is moving and I think it’s been ok. I think numbers-wise it’s been ok, productive-wise.” (On JJ’s minutes): “I rolled with him a few times multiple minutes. I think at least ten or twelve, that’s a long stretch for the way he runs and has to defend. I would prefer not to play him ten minutes straight or 12 minutes straight. That’s just tough on the body. That’s tough for him to defend on the other end and then run around on the offensive end. I kept him in after he missed his last shot then I put E’Twaun in, I think at the two minute mark, so 2:12, that probably put him in ten minute stretch, that’s a long stretch.” On E’Twaun and a closing role: “I just think he’s aggressive by nature, and when he does that he’s able to do different things. He’s able to spot up. He can create off the dribble so he made some shots for us tonight, which is good to see.” (On keeping the team up): “I keep believing that it’s going to turn in our favor, to be honest with you. I’m genuine. I’m upfront with them. I tell them as fair as I can, that you continue to work hard, you don’t skip steps. You control your thoughts. Easy right now to let misfortune and misgiving get into your mind. This is life’s lessons also basketball-wise. This is an opportunity for you to fight thru something. Stay together as a team, easy, easy to give in. But our coaching staff, we will continue to fight. We will continue to be resilient, continue to push these guys but continue to hug them at the same time. That’s what we do.”",Raw Data

You'll have to watch it for yourself, but just so you're emotionally prepared, this video includes Manziel throwing a football from the very top of Kyle Field into a basketball hoop in the end zone. It shows him hitting clay pigeons, mid-air, with a football. He pops balloons with a football. The extent to which this is amazing is slightly tempered by the fact that a couple of other guys in the video -- part of some kind of College Station-based trick shot troupe of some sort -- are able to perform many of the same feats, and none of them have won the Heisman Trophy.

Uncapped Ulster centre Luke Marshall is available to replace the injured Gordon D'Arcy after recovering from the dead leg incurred on provincial duty on Friday night, but the prognosis over Donnacha Ryan is less clear cut after the Munster lock, who is nursing a back spasm, took only a limited part in training on Tuesday. ""Brian and Sean trained this morning and are expected to be fully involved for the rest of the week,"" said team manager Mick Kearney. ""Donnacha continues to recover from a back spasm. He took part in some of the session today and we're continuing to monitor his rehab. ""Luke Marshall has recovered really well from his dead leg and trained fully this morning. There are no concerns about him."" D'Arcy and Simon Zebo have been ruled out for the rest of the Six Nations, Mike McCarthy appears to have endured a similar fate because of knee problem, while Jonathan Sexton will be absent against Scotland and possibly France a fortnight later. Paul O'Connell, Stephen Ferris and Tommy Bowe have been missing all championship, while Cian Healy has been suspended for three weeks for stamping on England's Dan Cole. The Leinster prop is not due to return until the final match against Italy on March 16, but Ireland are mulling over an appeal given that he is effectively serving a four-week ban. ""My own view is that there was a certain degree of ambiguity in the hearing's decision,"" Kearney said. ""While Cian was suspended for three weeks, he was ruled out of rugby for four weeks. That's an area we'd like clarity on. But unless we feel we have very good grounds for appeal, we won't appeal it.""",Raw Data
71,"United had a real fright at Old Trafford before seeing off a gritty Reading side 2-1 to land a home FA Cup quarter-final against holders Chelsea or Middlesbrough. They are chasing a repeat of their 1999 treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup with Ferguson demanding a tougher approach from his players. Goals from substitute Nani and striker Javier Hernandez edged out the relegation-threatened Royals who put the wind up United when Jobi McAnuff pulled one back in the 81st minute. And Fergie admitted: ""If you don't score the goals you should do, and then concede one, then the last ten minutes can be scary. ""Some of the football was fantastic and we could have scored a lot of goals. ""But I have to say we really should have punished them more."" But Ferguson is relishing another home tie in the last eight adding: ""We have a home tie and it can't get any better than that. ""You can't wish for anything more than that. No matter who we play, a home tie at Old Trafford means we have a great chance. ""This was a cup tie we got out of the road and now we have a big league game on Saturday at QPR and hopefully we can keep the momentum going."" United's win was marred by an ankle injury to England international Phil Jones who limped off after 42 minutes following a challenge from Reading skipper McAnuff. He will now miss Saturday's QPR clash and is also a doubt for next week's Champions League return with Real Madrid at Old Trafford. Ferguson said: ""We will have to assess it in the morning. It is an ankle injury so I would imagine he would not be ready for Saturday."" Substitute Nani, who was involved in a collision with an unmarked police car in Gatley, Cheshire, on Friday, was the star of the show, scoring the first in the 79th minute and setting up the second for Hernandez three minutes later. Nani said: ""It wasn't a big crash and I am happy I have nothing to worry about.""",Raw Data
72,"The Bees of Brentford did not just sting the pride of the Blues yesterday, they also put another huge dent in their fragile confidence. It took an 83rd-minute strike from Fernando Torres  his only attempt on goal  to rescue him, the team and manager Rafa Benitez from an embarrassment that would have dwarfed the defeat by bottom club QPR and humbling by Swansea in the Capital One Cup. Play-off hopefuls Brentford sent out a team including just three players who cost a fee, six free signings and two who are on loan. Benitez picked a surprisingly strong 11 for Chelseas 40th game of the season, leaving Demba Ba and Juan Mata on the bench  and he had to bring both on, Ba in the 82nd minute, Mata at half-time. Uwe Roslers Brentford were twice in the lead, through goals from Marcello Trotta in the 43rd minute and a penalty from Harry Forrester in the 73rd. Oscar and Torres  two players who cost £75m between them  kept holders Chelsea in the competition and secured a replay at Stamford Bridge in two weekends time on fifth-round day. It was a blustery day at Griffin Park, a cramped stadium still ­surrounded by houses with pubs on all four corners of the ground. The pitch was hardly an award-winning one either, with large patches covered with sand. In short, it was not the sort of place the multi-millionaires of Chelsea are used to. The Bees were up for it, but some of the delicate flowers from the Premier League clearly were not and boy did it show  ­particularly in the first half. Chelseas Marko Marin, in particular, looked like a boy amongst men and it was no surprise the German international was hooked at half-time. But even stalwarts Frank Lampard and John Terry did not seem like they wanted to be out there for this high noon encounter. The early exchanges saw Brentford create half-chances and there was an ­embarrassing mix-up in the 12th minute between Terry and keeper Ross Turnbull. Under pressure from the excellent ­Clayton Donaldson, skipper Terry passed back to his keeper, who picked up the ball. Forrester, though, having been teed up from the free-kick just inside the box, could only blaze over. Champions of Europe, youre having a laugh, went out the cry, after Gary Cahill sent an attempted pass straight into touch. Brentford got the goal they deserved ­following a fine tackle by Adam Forshaw on Lampard 30 yards out. Forresters right-foot shot was well struck and Turnbull could only parry weakly to Trotta. The Italian striker on loan from Fulham followed up to drive the rebound into the ground and in with his right boot. Chelsea stepped it up after the break and equalised through Oscar. The Brazilian showed class to evade two challenges and poked home high into the net from just ­inside the box. Just a minute after coming on for goal hero Trotta, Tom Adeyemi was brought down by Turnbull, who dashed off his line following a terrific through ball from ­Donaldson. Forrester calmly stroked the penalty low past the keeper. Benitez surprised many by taking off Branislav Ivanovic straight after he almost scored with an overhead kick and replacing him, like for like, with Cesar Azpilicueta. Rafa Benitez, youre not wanted here, was the response from the travelling ­support. Ba did come on in the 82nd minute, for Ryan Bertrand not Torres, and it was just as well. The Spaniard delivered a minute later, lashing home from the edge of the box after Ba hooked it to his fellow striker. In stoppage time a Mata cross struck Harlee Dean on the arm inside the penalty area. Chelsea went barmy at the lack of a penalty award, but to see the Bees beaten at the death would have been too cruel.",Raw Data

While Hamlin, his girlfriend Jordan Fish and little daughter are doing fine, they are also adjusting to a new life — something that has briefly consumed Hamlin’s attention and perhaps put a championship run a little deeper in his thoughts for a few days. Hamlin, who says that James is his first name and a family name, said that so far being a father has been easier than expected. In fact, the toughest part seems to have been sweating out the four days extra she waited to join the family. Hamlin skipped the testing of the Generation 6 car at Charlotte Motor Speedway last week as he waited for his daughter’s birth. “That was the biggest thing was being four days late,"" Hamlin said. ""It’s like, ‘OK, it’s coming in a minute. Any minute, any minute.'” As to deciding to miss the test, that was an easy call — he wanted to stay by Fish’s side. “I felt like it was more important not to leave her at any point,” he said. He said his and Fish’s parents have been on hand to help out and that he’s not losing that much sleep yet since Taylor James is sleeping quite a bit.",Raw Data

His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. I come from a long line of stone-cold hustlers. My grandfather loan-sharked and ran numbers on the south side of Indianapolis for his entire adult life. My father’s barbershop doubled as a craps house after hours, and I learned to hustle “tip books” at his neighborhood bars. My uncle ran a pea-shake house out of a dry cleaners. My grandfather, father and uncle all held down full-time jobs at Chrysler while hustling to make ends meet. I mention this to add weight to my assertion that Andy Reid pulled off the greatest hustle I’ve ever witnessed. The stench of Reid’s last two years in Philly is still smothering football fans in the City of Brotherly Love and meanwhile he was the hottest coaching prospect in the NFL, the first coach awarded a seat during professional football’s annual game of musical chairs. The Kansas City Chiefs and owner Clark Hunt outraced Arizona and San Diego to Reid’s Philadelphia coaching carcass. I can’t positively say I’m against this hiring. What I can say is that I’m absolutely amazed by its urgency and swiftness. The Chiefs, Chargers and Cardinals chased after Reid like he was one of the Kardashians with a clean bill of health from Planned Parenthood and a fresh tummy tuck from a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Hey, I’ve lived in Los Angeles for more than two years. I’ve heard all the Kardashian stories. Yes, they can put that thang on ya. But the truth is, there are more fish in the sea. Did Clark Hunt know this? There are fish with fewer miles on their odometer, fish without indisputable video evidence of their sideline freakiness and questionable decision-making. Because we’re in the “information age,” few people in the national media are focusing on Reid’s bizarre and troubling final two years in Philadelphia. Everyone wants to be first to provide the information about where Reid is going and who he is bringing with him and who is leaving because of his arrival. You can’t get that information from Reid, his handlers and his associates if you are publicly reminding Clark Hunt and Chiefs fans just how awful Reid was in Philadelphia in 2011 and 2012. Let me repeat: I’m not anti-Andy Reid or retread coaches. There was a time when I thought Reid was as good as any coach in football. I loved the way he handled Donovan McNabb. And Bill Belichick, Dick Vermeil, Mike Shanahan, Tony Dungy and a bunch of other retread coaches have been highly successful. But Reid is a unique retread. A high percentage of Eagles fans believes Reid hasn’t been right since his defensive coordinator Jim Johnson died of cancer in 2009. Reid hasn’t won a playoff game since Johnson passed. My issue is the last two years. The Eagles were the “dream team” in 2011 and Super Bowl favorite. They went 8-8. They had to win their final four games to reach 8-8. To the utter shock and surprise of no one not named Andy Reid, the decision to promote longtime offensive-line coach Juan Castillo to DEFENSIVE coordinator blew up in Reid’s face. In their eight losses, the Eagles surrendered an average of 29.8 points. The Eagles spent millions of dollars building a dream team, and Reid turned his defense over to an offensive-line coach on a whim. This is like getting a date with Beyonce and consulting with Ike Turner on how to romance her. Reid allegedly had a nine-hour interview with Clark Hunt and his entourage on Wednesday. I hope someone asked Reid to write a short essay about Juan Castillo. Did anyone have the nerve to ask Reid about his son overdosing and dying at Philly’s training camp this summer? The kid had steroids on him, too. There are so many questions you have to ask Andy Reid. Tell us what role you played in giving Michael Vick a new lucrative contract and then overseeing an offensive strategy that repeatedly put your undersized quarterback in harm’s way because of your love of the pass and hatred of the run. The Eagles went 4-12 this season. Reid fired Castillo early. The defense got significantly worse. The players quit. Vick complained his teammates weren’t committed. Reid left a mess in Philly. If ever a coach needed a year off work to focus on his family, recharge and self-exam, it’s Andy Reid. Instead, he’s juggling coaching offers. Yep, maybe he’s John Fox and all he needs is a fresh start. Or maybe he’s been chasing his tail for too long and he’s gone crazy. Maybe the fact he could have his pick of jobs after being a disaster the last two years will stop him from doing the kind of self-inventory necessary to snap out of this tailspin. Hunt is handing Reid all sorts of power. Reid will pick his own front office. General manager Scott Pioli has been relieved of his duties, which is a good thing. But I don’t see Reid as some sort of personnel guru. A lack of depth has hurt the Eagles the past few years. This is simply a remarkable job of failing forward by Andy Reid. He found the perfect NFL owner and fan base desperate to get over the pain of a 2-14 season and an overmatched general manager. According to season-long gossip and reports, Hunt has sought the advice of Marty Schottenheimer, the former Chiefs coach. Reid reminds me of Schottenheimer, only Reid loves to pass the ball and Marty loved to run it. Marty had a successful run in Cleveland and needed a fresh start in Kansas City. It worked out well. A few years ago, Pioli reminded me of Carl Peterson, the general manager who hired Schottenheimer in KC and worked with Schottenheimer during the 1990s. For a time, Marty and Carl balanced each other. Who is going to balance Andy Reid? I realize no one wants to talk about it now, while we’re all pretending Reid is Don Shula coming off the '72 season, but there’s plenty of proof Reid went crazy in Philly.",Raw Data

77,"I was looking forward to my rematch with Juan Manuel Márquez. Our first fight had been exciting and even though it took a few years for Márquez to finally accept a rematch with me the fans seemed happy to see it, too. The arena was electric. It inspired me. After I scored the knockdown, early in the fight, I went back to my corner thinking I would finish him in the next round. Freddie Roach told me, ‘We have him right where we want him. Finish it.” Well, I couldn’t finish him in the next round and as the fight continued I thought ‘Here we go again.’ Márquez’s superb boxing skills and excellent stamina got him back into the fight. After the eighth round Freddie told me the fight was becoming too close and we needed to win the last four rounds to avoid the close decision we had in our first fight. “Take it to him Manny. Pick up the pace — double the pace. You’ve got the better speed and power. It's time to use all your weapons.” I stopped counterpunching in those last four and attacked him constantly. Staying away from his right hand helped me to score more, too. Freddie’s advice was right and I thought it was a clear victory for me that night because I won those last four rounds. I was so happy to be a world champion again. It’s a night I’ll never forget. In my opinion the second fight was the closest of our trilogy. It was a very hard-fought fight and much more exciting than the first one. This time Pacquiao surprised me a bit as he was not as aggressive as he had been in the first fight. He seemed to have become a more complete and certainly a much better all-around fighter. He was no longer a one-handed fighter like he was the first time we fought. The left-hand-happy Pacquiao had become a two-fisted fighter, using his right effectively. I was able to control the first half of the fight by dictating the pace and I was able to build a lead. I felt that I was hurting him, which made me more confident. So I became a little more aggressive and it cost me as I caught with a left hand and went down in the third round. I was angry at myself, but I was not hurt. The last six rounds were very competitive and I felt he was trying very hard and I was able to counter him very effectively. I was landing a lot of right hands and knew I had the fight won. But once again the judges took my victory away by giving Pacquiao the nod by split decision. I still get very angry when I think about hearing those scores being read. After two fights, I felt I had won at least 19 of the 24 rounds. Pacquiao's four knockdowns made the scores closer than they really were. Look, after 24 rounds, I have two scores in my favor and one even and Pacquiao's got three his way but one of them was by only one point. Just like the first fight, I knew I beat him. And just like the first fight, the judges did not see it my way. There is not much I can do about that. I did my best. Too bad the judges did not do the same.

78,"Throwback Guard Knight calls to mind versatile guards of NBAs yesteryear by George Blaha Brandon Knight reminds George Blaha of other versatile guards in Pistons history. Ned Dishman (NBAE/Getty) The great thing about Brandon Knight is hes such a high-character guy and he has tremendous talent. Sooner or later, youre going to find the perfect spot to play him. He works tirelessly on his game, he loves to play and he has, in some cases, almost freakish athletic ability. He has a great touch on his shot and great lift, as we see when he attacks the basket. He has terrific anticipation defensively. Players, especially the ones who spend just one year in college, take some time to get adjusted to the league and then teammates and coaches have to adjust to them. Everybody doesnt fit into a certain category right away. Were seeing a guy who very probably is going to be hard to guard as an off guard, whether hes 6-foot-3 or not. Hes very, very comfortable playing off the ball and, of course, he has a great handle. When hes playing off the ball, hes able to do a lot of things many shooting guards cant. Hes a handful for opponents and he obviously gives the Pistons a big boost, as was in plain evidence when he scored a career-high 32 points in Wednesdays great win at Washington. This is still a league that relies on talent. If you dont have a certain amount of ability, you wont be here for long and the guys who lead teams to good seasons and maybe down the road great seasons have to have tremendous talent. It was funny, after the game in Washington, when Lawrence Frank said maybe we should only play Brandon once a week because he had such great energy. In reality, thats what he brings more often than not. Its not just physical energy, its the mental toughness and his love for the game. When hes out there, you can tell he really wants to be out there. Im sure basketball is very high on his list of favorite things in this world, right up there with his family and his friends. This is a guy who is very positive and wants to help his team and has the ability to do that. Thats the most important thing this guy has tremendous talent. The way Brandon plays reminds me of some of the guards who were in the league when I first started. Ive been in the league now for 37 full seasons this is my 38th and right before I started, they didnt call guys point guards and shooting guards. Its all kind of evolved in the last 40 years. I realize thats a long time, but there were some great players right before I started. Dave Bing had his best years before I started as the voice of the Pistons, and they didnt call him a point guard. He won the scoring title in 1968, but he could handle the ball and set up his teammates. He was a tremendous guard. There were many teams that had Dave Bing-type players who were all-time great guards who you wouldnt necessarily call a point guard. Oscar Robertson averaged a triple-double, so I suppose he was a point guard, but we just always referred to Oscar as a guard. Oscar could play this game and play it like nobody else could. I dont know if you have to have a pure point guard and a pure shooting guard, but somebody has to think like a point guard on important possessions. Right now, the Pistons have the best of all worlds. They do have a pure point guard in Jose Calderon, who is also an excellent shooter, and an off guard in Brandon Knight who is an excellent shooter and has a great handle and also makes plays for his teammates. Both of those guys are very dangerous when theyre on the court together. As good as both of them are individually, together they are greater than the sum of their parts. Theyre really difficult to deal with when theyre on the court at the same time. When you see Jose Calderon have 18 assists and Brandon Knight score 32 and I think Brandon could have scored 40, he was rolling to that extent, and Jose clearly could have had 20-plus assists you realize that they are great at their specialties. As good a shooter as Jose is, hes an even better passer. And as much as you like Brandons ballhandling and passing ability, when he gets rolling he is an impossible-to-stop shooter and scorer. They have stick-out strengths that make them players everybody would like to have. Theyre a treat to watch when theyre playing together.",Raw Data
79,"With Arsne Wenger reduced to puddle status in the wake of yesterday's well publicised ""MELTDOWN"", now is probably a good time for the Fiver to tiptoe around the high viz durable plastic ""Caution: Wet Floor"" warning sign (complete with a helpful illustration of a Gareth Bale silhouette flinging itself through the air) erected in front of the now dissolved Arsenal manager and see how things are going in the Bayern Munich camp. The Germans performed their obligatory media duties yesterday afternoon too, but with so many folk including the Fiver getting in a right old tizzy over Wenger's ""MELTDOWN"", their thoughts about tonight's Big Cup knockout round first leg have been comparatively ignored. As anyone who has ever read a Guardian Sport comments section or listened to a radio phone-in show will know, football is a sport followed by the kind of people whose opinions are always carefully considered and well thought-out and never half-baked or laughably knee-jerk. With that in mind, it's no surprise that in the wake of Arsenal's recent reverse against Blackeye Rovers, many people have decided that a side boasting such talents as Santi Cazorla, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere stand zero chance against German opponents so ruthlessly invincible they've conceded, on average, a goal a game in this season's Big Cup and have already been spanked by a team from Belarus. While they go into tonight's match as fairly hot favourites, the Fiver would like to think Jupp Heynckes and his players weren't merely being kind when they rubbished the notion that the outcome is a foregone conclusion. ""Both teams have a lot of quality,"" said Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, before his manager weighed in with a slightly over the top ""if you take away the game against [Blackeye Rovers], it is a positive [season for Arsenal]"". While Arsenal's lack of consistency has been their most consistent trait this season, Bayern Munich have been razing all before them this season like a [insert potentially ill-advised historical military simile here], conceding so few Bundesliga goals that their keeper Manuel Neuer has had to pimp his right-hand glove in order to stop him picking his nose from boredom. ""I don't have a result I wish for as such, but I think that we can win if we play at our very top level,"" said Heynckes, ushering his players into a lift and getting Neuer to press the top button with his massive padded finger.

80,"Hindsight is a wonderful thing. This time last year Andre Villas-Boas was unemployed, and his former employers Chelsea were on a run that took them to Champions League glory, admittedly at the expense of domestic form. Tottenham, meanwhile, were in the midst of an alarming slump that started just about the time Harry Redknapp, with the support of the tabloid media, decided he was England manager elect using that as a weighty bargaining chip in contract negotiations with his club, if you believe everything you read, which ED does not. Fast forward 12 months and Tottenham under the total control holistic managers like AVB require have again thumped Inter Milan in Europe. Gareth Bales improvement since the last time he destroyed the Nerazzurri was reflected in the scoreline and, despite shortcomings in the striking department, Spurs look very much the real deal. Chelsea, meanwhile, have lost to Steaua Bucharest after their fans added cardboard boxes and terrible puns to their repertoire of A4 printouts and plastic flags. Spurs were on a similar tangent to this a couple of seasons ago, but a failure to completely solve their striking conundrum coupled with managerial instability saw them stall and regress. Sound familiar Blues fans? Daniel Levy and his advisers would do well to learn from past mistakes, which Roman Abramovichs ego seems incapable of accommodating. Had the Russian not yielded to his footballer playmates and stood by AVB - who was employed with a long-term restructuring project in mind - Chelsea could well be in the midst of a title challenge now. Levy is a different beast to Abramovich, a shrewd operator and a company man, less driven by ego and self-gratification than his Chelsea counterpart. He will see this as a great opportunity to establish Spurs in the top three while their London rivals eat their own hands. And in Manchester, Citys dressing room is not about to get any cooler while United for all their efficiency are beatable and catchable; Barcelona they are not. There is no need for widespread change at White Hart Lane. An international striker is essential and a left-back would be useful, while AVB would not turn down a world-class playmaker. Apparently Luka Modric has itchy feet in Madrid. It seems a bit too obvious to say it, but Spurs main priority is to keep Bale at the club. Not just because he is responsible for most of their goals such players can, with the right funds, be replaced but because the hype surrounding Bale makes his retention a PR goal 40 million cannot buy. Keep Bale, the rest will follow. It shows Spurs are serious, will not be swayed by tempting offers, have a long-term project and the bucks to back it up. Bale is the ultimate professional he wont weep to Marca if a bid from Real Madrid is rejected. Hardball all the way, no compromise. With Modric, Spurs hand was forced; the player had a shorter contract than Bale and a lighter kinship to the club and English football. Culturally, Spain and Italy are closer fits for a Croatian than England. Welshman Bale enjoys London, is ideally suited to the Premier League, and as a youth rejected Manchester United because he felt he would get a first-team place at Spurs. His head is screwed on, and it is steered entirely by football. And if Los Merengues offer Ronaldo-esque money for Bale, not even the most cold-hearted South American striker will see acceptance as a sign of weakness. Because the bidding war will start the moment Bale returns from holiday this summer. QUOTE OF THE DAY: ""I think (the penalty) was very soft. To give a penalty in this situation, and especially when you have so many referees in their positions, it is soft. You cannot change the situation but it is very soft.

81,"At 41, the end of Tottenham Hotspur’s ironman might at last be nigh. On the field, the former U.S. goalkeeper saw his record streak of 310 consecutive Premier League starts snapped on Oct. 7 when Hugo Lloris got the assignment and he has played sporadically since mid-November. But off the field, Friedel has been busy planning for a next step that he knows must eventually come. Friedel is projected to get his UEFA A-level coaching license in May 2014, coincidentally when his new contract extension with Spurs runs out. He’ll turn 43 then, time perhaps for the next phase in the best European career any American has ever had. “I don’t know if it’s definitely coaching or management that I’ll be going into,” Friedel says. “Whether it’s that or whether it’s doing other things with the football club, whether it’s doing television, I don’t know which road I’ll go down right now but I will be involved in the game, there’s no doubt about that.” He was keen on getting the schooling for his second career while active in England. “The coaching levels over in Europe are a lot more stringent and strict than they are in the U.S., so it’s wise to be taking them here because there’s a lot to be learned,” says Friedel. “A lot of us players think when you’ve played a long time you know it all but it’s a different world when you’re coaching.” And Spurs, in his view, was the best place to do it. “While I am at such a great club it’s a great advantage to go through your coaching levels,” Friedel says. “The people that they have employed from the youth all the way through to the senior level is of the highest ilk. To be able to learn the ropes from these people is a big, big advantage.” AMERICAN PRIDE From Dempsey to Reyna, find out the best US footballers of all-time. That played a crucial role in re-upping with the club in late December in spite of losing his starting job. That and the peace he has found with his lot. “When I signed my contract here I was 40 years of age and Tottenham were on the lookout for a long-term number one goalkeeper,” says Friedel. “That’s not someone who’s 40 years of age.” But by virtue of Tottenham’s financial prudence and patience with finding the right long-term solution, Friedel got the job for a year, he says. So when the right deal presented itself and Spurs signed the then-25-year-old Lloris, France’s starting goalkeeper, from Olympique Lyon for a mere $13 million, Friedel knew he’d eventually have to make way. “In no way was this as big of an ordeal as the press made it out to seem,” says Friedel. “Of course I still want to play but I also know what my role is. It’s not a place that any player aspires to be in, sitting and watching games. However, there are other aspects of what goes on at a football club and there’s a lot more things you can do.” Friedel has matured and can look at things from a remove. “I don’t go in and bang down doors anymore and say, You have to play me,” he says. “At my age that’s not how it works. The older you get, your ego goes down a little bit. You can see the big picture a lot more clearly.” “This is a tremendous opportunity and stepping stone for me to stay involved in the game as a player, get all my coaching badges, decide what I want to do next while keeping involved with a club that has aspirations,” added Friedel. That’s why when Spurs offered an extension, he turned down the chance to start for Blackburn Rovers, the club he played at for eight years and started his streak. And that’s why he didn’t entertain the idea of going anywhere else, even though “a few places” showed interest. “It’s a bit strange,” Friedel says with a chuckle. “I turn 41 and the offers keep coming in.” HOT STREAK Which Americans are putting in top performances abroad? Check them out. That’s been a trend. When he was 37, he opted for Aston Villa over Manchester City and staying at Rovers. At 40, he could have stuck with Villa, gone to West Bromwich Albion or Liverpool, but picked Spurs. Every time around, he opted for the bigger challenge. And if that endangered his streak, he was hardly aware of it. “I never knew what the number was,” says Friedel. “When I was at Aston Villa somebody came up to me and said, ‘You know, if you play three more games you break the record.’” He had no idea. Nor did he start counting. Friedel’s streak is over now, but not his career. There is another season and a half to be played yet. Who knows how much more he’ll tack on. He’s borrowed time before. He has a revolving credit line of it, in fact. And if he quits, there’s the newest bigger challenge to look forward to.",Raw Data
82,"If you follow NBA history and care about the league, as I do, you know how inevitable the cycle of success and failure historically has been. Even the greatest franchises aren’t immune. Teams on top eventually find themselves in the lower echelon, at least for a few seasons. There’s really no getting around it. The great Celtics dynasty of the ’60s with Bill Russell ended and they fell on hard times until Larry Bird arrived, and then it was more than 20 years between titles again for Boston. Turn the page even to the Lakers. After the Showtime era, they really struggled until they found Kobe. The Bulls won six titles with Michael Jordan and then went almost a decade with some of the worst teams in the league. It’s pretty obvious that you have to go through lean times occasionally in this league. That’s why we have a draft and the teams with the worst records get the highest picks and you end up with a LeBron James if you’re Cleveland and a Derrick Rose if you’re the Chicago Bulls and a Patrick Ewing, back in the day, if you’re the Knicks. Those were lucky drafts for those teams. Cleveland, unfortunately, wasn’t able to keep LeBron, but he did wonders for the franchise when he was there. When the Bad Boys finally ran their course, the Pistons certainly struggled. They had a brief renaissance under Doug Collins, who frankly is a genius as he’s proving again with Philadelphia. Then it took some masterful dealings and signings by Joe Dumars to almost immediately resurrect the team early in the last decade. I’ve always said Joe does not get enough credit for what he did to bring the Pistons all the way back to being the Pistons again. When Joe took the job, remember, it was at one of the lowest points for the franchise. Grant Hill was leaving in free agency and so many hopes had been pinned on Grant that it felt like the Pistons were headed for some long, dark days. But three years after Joe was named president of basketball operations by Mr. Davidson, the Pistons were in the Eastern Conference finals – and just one year later, they were NBA champions again. So good things can happen. And sometimes in a hurry. But there’s no getting around it. No matter who you are or where you play, especially in this day of the salary cap and all of that, teams that are at or near the top, when it’s finally over, you’re going to suffer a big and deep drop. The Pistons have been fighting to get out of that spot the past few years. And, frankly, despite what we’re seeing so far this season, I think they’re pointed in the right direction. I’ve long felt – and I got this from one of my most respected analysts on Pistons telecasts some years back, Dick Motta – that the hardest positions to fill in the NBA are center and point guard. Dick said when he came into the league in the ’60s, there were about five good centers and five good point guards. And when he was doing games with me in the ’80s, he said, “George, there’s still about five good centers and five good point guards.” They’re scarce. You always need to put a premium on guys who play those positions and here the Pistons have found two in the lottery in the last two years. I’d like to think they’ve found themselves a center for the future and he’s already playing like a standout, close to a star even now, in Greg Monroe. And they have a young point guard who has all the tools and all the intelligence that it takes to run an offense in this league. Brandon Knight, to me, was a steal in the draft. It’s going to be hard for Brandon, when you have a team that is searching for an identity and trying to learn a new system, to be the savoir in the first 10 or 20 games of his career. But, believe me, he’s going to be a very good point guard in this league. And I don’t think it’s going to take two or three seasons, either. I think before this season is over, we’ll see a lot more. We’ve already seen it in stretches. It’s going to be fun to watch those two young guys, especially, to see how quickly they become the players I think they will become – and to see how fast they are able to get the Pistons back to being the Pistons again.",Raw Data

84,"LOS ANGELES — As the final seconds were winding down, and the implications of Notre Dame's impending 22-13 victory over USC were beginning to sink in, linebacker Manti Te'o bounded around the Fighting Irish bench with a message for anyone and everyone. ""It don't matter,"" Te'o shouted. ""Just like I said."" Te'o was still feeding off the high of a goal-line stand that had begun to empty the sold-out LA Coliseum moments earlier, but his pet phrase — used to buck up the rest of the defense when it is in the shadow of its own goal post — serves as a fitting mantra for top-ranked Notre Dame's unlikely, unbeaten run to the national championship game. It doesn't matter how the Fighting Irish got here to 12-0 — with the help of overtime and good fortune against Stanford and Pittsburgh, plus the aid of late-season losses by Alabama, Oregon and Kansas State. It doesn't matter how they have looked at times, squeaking past BYU and Purdue at home with an offense that seems to generate just enough to get by. It doesn't even matter that they got to play USC without its star quarterback Matt Barkley, who was out Saturday with a separated shoulder. It doesn't matter that nobody else expected anything more than seven or eight wins from a schedule that looked devastatingly difficult at the start of the season. Here they are – the Notre Dame Fighting Irish against somebody on Jan. 7 in South Florida: Alabama, Georgia or (perhaps by slight chance) Oregon. ""I can't believe we're going to the national championship,"" Te'o said outside the locker room, nearly an hour after the win. ""It's something you always dream of, (but) throughout this whole season, we focused from week to week to week. We didn't look at the big picture. ""So when we stepped into this game, we understood that this was Game 12 and we had to take care of Game 12 to get to Game 13. After it was over, we looked at the scoreboard and said, 'What's next?' The national championship."" Their arrival was stamped, fittingly enough, by a pair of fourth-quarter, goal-line stands, the type which have stamped their season. The Irish had stopped Pittsburgh, forcing a field goal instead of a touchdown that made a comeback possible. And they had beaten Stanford, when they stoned the Cardinal at the goal line in overtime (with the help of a replay official). But with USC, hanging with Notre Dame despite freshman quarterback Max Wittek replacing Barkley, with a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line after consecutive pass interference penalties, the Irish could not be budged. Two sneaks by Wittek were stuffed, as was tailback Curtis McNeal's dive. On fourth down, fullback Soma Vainuku was open in the flat but he could not hang on to Wittek's low throw while tumbling in the end zone. ""If you followed us at all this year, that's how we play,"" said Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly, in his third season. ""We come up big defensively at some point in the game. We did that again. Unbelievable goal-line stand."" The idea that Notre Dame, with its bungled coaching hires, stringent academic requirements and glaring lack of speed, could compete for a national championship seemed quaint just a few months ago. But along with the glittering metallic golden domes and the sheen of the Notre Dame brand, the mystique of the Irish has been restored. When Raul Ibanez belted pinch-hit homers for the Yankees in the MLB playoffs? Well, of course he would. And when the Lakers or Celtics find good fortune on their way to a playoff victory? It always seems to figure. So, earlier in the fourth quarter, when USC coach Lane Kiffin sprinted down the sideline to call timeout — wiping out a touchdown pass from Wittek to Marqise Lee — it figured that the Trojans would have to settle for a field goal. But don't call it luck of the Irish. ""I wouldn't call it luck, but I would call it consistency,"" said Notre Dame defensive end Kapron Lewis-Moore. ""Everybody calls it luck or whatever, but I think we play sound defense and feel like we're a very good team."" The Notre Dame defense was not the only unit that played to form. The offense, behind the determined running of Theo Riddick, had to settle for five field goals from Kyle Brindza. But there were no turnovers and enough key plays along the way — Riddick keeping a foot inbounds to convert a third-down reception and tight end Tyle Eifert's juggling catch for another. Brindza also brought down the electric Lee near midfield, preventing him from returning a kickoff for a touchdown. ""You can see those guys understand the game and they really play well together,"" Kiffin said of Notre Dame. ""They're very physical, they're pretty old school. That's why they've got a lot of their games with close scores. They're not very exotic. But they don't screw up. ""You've got to play really well to beat them. They're not going to hand you things — just like tonight: They go 69 plays without a turnover. You're going to win a lot of games when you do that."" So maybe it is not an accident, or good fortune, that is helping Notre Dame win these games. Maybe it is part of a plan, the same determination that seems to show up most on the goal line. ""It doesn't matter what they do, it doesn't matter where the ball is,"" Te'o said. ""It's just a mentality. It doesn't matter where you put the ball down. It doesn't matter where it ends up as long as it doesn't cross the goal line. It really doesn't matter."" For those who believe Notre Dame will be exposed in the title game, that Alabama or anyone else will reveal how fortunate the Irish have been this season, and how the gap is substantial between the Irish and the SEC's best ... well, perhaps they are right. But for a team that is used to being discounted, does it really matter?",Raw Data
85,"''You know, I was fired up for this game,'' Zellous said. ''That Game 2 left a bad taste in our mouth. You know, we could have done a better job in a lot of different things, and I think today, we made a conscious effort to do things better.'' Tamika Catchings added 17 points and Erlana Larkins had 10 points and 15 rebounds for the Fever, who took a 2-1 lead in the series and can win their first title at home Sunday night against the defending champs. It had been a tense series. Reeve was fined after her actions in Game 2, which Fever coach Lin Dunn called ''disrespectful.'' Indiana's play did the talking on Friday. The Fever's lead of 70-33 with 1:58 left in the third quarter was the largest lead by any team in WNBA Finals history. The extent of the blowout left Reeve seated with her hand on her chin for much of the second half. Rebekkah Brunson, who scored 12 points, was the only Minnesota player to reach double figures. ''I think Indiana played the way Indiana always plays,'' Reeve said. ''They defend. You defend, you have a chance to win a championship. That's it.'' When asked what the Lynx need to do differently in Game 4, Reeve simply said, ''Score more points than them.'' Minnesota's previous playoff scoring low this season was 70 points against the Fever in Game 1 of the Finals. Maya Moore was held to eight points in Game 3 and Seimone Augustus, who scored 27 points in Game 2, had six on 3-for-9 shooting on Friday night. Minnesota finished with just six assists. Indiana did it all without No. 2 scorer Katie Douglas. She is still sidelined with a severely sprained left ankle. Reserve guard Jeanette Pohlen is out with a left knee injury. The game was intense again, but in control. The only incident was a rare technical called against Catchings with the game well in hand for the Fever. Indiana led 21-16 at the end of the first quarter, and the Fever extended their lead to 28-18 in the second quarter, forcing the Lynx to call a timeout. A no-look pass by Catchings directly led to a 3-pointer by Zellous that gave the Fever a 33-20 advantage. On Indiana's next possession, Catchings drove through traffic for a layup to push the lead to 15. The Fever held Minnesota scoreless for 3:40 during a 12-0 run to take a 40-20 edge. Indiana led 45-27 at halftime. Minnesota shot 5-for-19 from the field in the second quarter. Those tough, contested shots the Lynx made in the first quarter didn't fall in the second. Indiana outrebounded Minnesota 20-15 in the first half, forced nine turnovers and committed just three. ''We started the offense by going at them on the defensive end,'' Zellous said. ''We were able to get an attack. We were pushing up on them. We didn't let them do what they did to us on Game 2, and it made our job so much easier on offense.'' The Fever didn't rest. Catchings' baseline jumper pushed Indiana's lead back to 20 early in the third quarter. Erin Phillips was fouled on a 3-pointer by Monica Wright, and she fell to the ground in front of Reeve. Phillips made all three free throws to make it 54-29. Indiana continued to pour it on and led 70-38 at the end of the third quarter. The Fever went on cruise control in the fourth quarter as Minnesota tried to make the score more respectable. Zellous finally made Indiana's first field goal of the fourth quarter with 2:21 remaining, and the Fever still had a 20-point lead at that point. Indiana knows the series isn't over. The Fever led Phoenix 2-1 in 2009 and could have clinched in Game 4 at home. Indiana lost that game, then lost Game 5 and the series in Phoenix. ''We sat in the huddle and I told everybody, `Don't get excited about this. Do not get excited,''' Catchings said. ''We'll come back in here tomorrow, we'll look at some video and get better tomorrow and we'll come back out Sunday. I don't want anybody celebrating. None of that.'' The Fever also know Minnesota won't quit. ''We expect the defending champs to come out and play like their backs are against the wall,'' Fever guard Briann January said. ''We know they're going to give everything, and we have to respond and we have to bring everything we have. It's going to be another war.''",Raw Data
86,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Spewing such smack this season has helped establish Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman among the NFL’s most notorious trash-talkers entering Sunday’s second-round game at Atlanta (1 p.m. ET on FOX). Yet no matter what Sherman says inside the Georgia Dome, it will likely fall upon deaf ears. That’s because Atlanta’s offense already hears during every practice from a motor-mouthed cornerback who possesses just as much “swag” and an even more impressive NFL resume. Asante Samuel isn’t shy bragging about it, either, when asked to compare Sherman’s style to his. “He’s pretty darn confident,” Samuel told FOXSports.com on Thursday at Falcons headquarters. “He plays pretty good ball. Samuel then punctuated the point by proudly using of one of his favorite self-identifying catchphrases: “Deuce here, Deuce here.” The Falcons wouldn’t want him anyplace else. It isn’t lip service when his teammates talk about Samuel’s impact since he arrived here last April in the league’s biggest offseason steal. Samuel, 32, continued to play at a high level in his 10th NFL season. He had five interceptions and 19 passes defensed — Samuel’s highest total since playing with Philadelphia in 2008 — on a unit that ranked fourth in fewest points allowed (18.7 a game) during the regular season. According to STATS LLC, quarterbacks completed only 52.7 percent of the 74 passes thrown Samuel’s way. Numbers, though, only tell part of what he has meant. When he arrived in a trade with Philadelphia for a mere seventh-round draft choice, the Falcons had a solid secondary but a mild-mannered one. There was little of the verbal bluster that can become infectious and spur inspired performances. Samuel immediately began providing that during offseason practices. When he hadn’t had a pass thrown in his direction during the team’s initial OTA sessions, Samuel began challenging Matt Ryan to come his way — loudly. Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff, who orchestrated the deal with Philadelphia and knew Samuel from when both were with the New England Patriots from 2003 to 2007, even got called out on the sideline. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. “I’m like, ‘Matt! You’ve got to throw the ball over here! I’ve got to show these people what I can do! Thomas — tell Matt to throw the ball over here!’” Samuel said with a smile. When the Falcons quarterback finally acquiesced, Samuel intercepted Ryan the same way he had in three of four previous career meetings. Samuel celebrated by wildly running around the practice fields hollering and giving Dimitroff some good-natured grief. Those antics admittedly stunned Atlanta’s other defensive backs and laid the groundwork for them to come out of their shells. “We saw, ‘We … can … actually … get … away … with … (saying) that?’” said Falcons free safety Thomas DeCoud, pausing between words to emphasize how startled he and his teammates were by how Samuel carries himself. “It’s definitely helped us a lot this season. We’ve turned it up. That swagger has turned into turnovers, pass breakups and confidence that he has amplified for us to become better players.” DeCoud and strong safety William Moore both enjoyed their best NFL seasons. Fellow starting cornerback Dunta Robinson began justifying the six-year, $57 million free-agent contract he signed to leave Houston during the 2011 offseason. And the Falcons were able to weather the loss of nickel cornerback Brent Grimes, the team’s 2012 franchise player who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in the season-opener. “We feed into it,” Moore said of Samuel’s personality. “When you see guys doing stuff like that, one thing you learn is to be confident in yourself and what you can do. We just follow him.” That’s a form of leadership often lost amid Samuel’s bravado. “I’m a talk s*** guy,” Samuel said. “I talk s*** to everybody — the offense, the quarterback, the offensive coordinator. They had my back and came along with me. They started chirping. “It just raises the energy in practice. Everybody is competing and getting better. That’s what the coaches and players love.” The NFL franchise from the City of Brotherly Love could have used Samuel in 2012. However, Philadelphia began setting the stage for Samuel’s departure in the 2011 offseason by signing prized cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha in free agency and acquiring Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie as part of a trade with Arizona involving quarterback Kevin Kolb. The Eagles tried trading Samuel during the 2011 season but his $5.9 million base salary scared potential suitors away. With his 2012 base salary slated at $9.5 million, the deal with Atlanta was completed before the NFL draft only because Samuel agreed to a restructured three-year, $14.5 million contract. Samuel’s presence was sorely missed in Philadelphia with Asomugha and Rodgers-Cromartie both tanking en route to a 4-12 season that got head coach Andy Reid fired. As the Falcons put the finishing touches on a lopsided 30-17 road win over the Eagles in late October, Samuel and his fellow defensive backs celebrated by dancing on the sideline. Reid was angry enough that he snubbed Samuel after the game. Samuel told FOXSports.com that he still has “love for Philly” and “it kind of hurt a little bit” to see how badly the defense played in 2012. Samuel, though, has no sympathy for those in Eagles management who did “bad business” by getting rid of him. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last July that Reid believed Samuel’s skills were in “deep decline.” Reid emphatically denied saying such, but the words stuck with Samuel. When news broke in October that Reid had fired defensive coordinator Juan Castillo, Samuel posted on Twitter that “sometimes you have to blame yourself. You can't try and always point the figure at someone else. I'm just saying ... Ain’t no decline over here.” Asked whether he played as well last season in Philadelphia as in 2012 with the Falcons, the 32-year-old Samuel said, “I think there wasn’t too much of a difference. I had three interceptions instead of five. I had less passes defensedm but I got much less action. They were throwing the ball to the other side to other people. “The whole team was kind of in shambles. I’m trying to hold everybody together, still trying to be the leader and get the secondary right. As you can see, the leadership left from the secondary when I was gone.” Samuel’s next goal is to bring his own penchant for playoff success to a Falcons team that lost its opening game in three of the past four seasons. Stemming largely from his time in New England, Samuel is the NFL’s all-time postseason leader in interceptions returned for touchdowns (four) and passes defensed (25). With one more interception, Samuel will tie Baltimore safety Ed Reed’s postseason interception record of eight. Just like with Sherman, the only way Atlanta will silence its critics is by ending its playoff drought. Moore said Samuel already is getting the team mentally prepared to roar. “He carried us all through the season with some of his positive energy,” Moore said. “In practice, he’s still doing it now. He’s saying, ‘We ain’t going home early! We’re going to roll!’",Raw Data
87,"Before the Baltimore Ravens stormed into Mile High and stole a game they weren’t supposed to win, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League, stood at the front of a packed fourth-floor lounge at the stadium and answered questions from a sea of Denver Broncos’ season-ticket holders. For more than 40 minutes, and then for another 10 minutes with a group of reporters, Goodell spoke about all the ills that currently plague the league. Is the league considering more rule changes to help player safety? Will Kevlar helmets soon be mandated in order to prevent players’ brains from turning to mush? Has the NFL’s crisis changed from a health and safety problem for players into an existential problem for the league? It was a flurry of bad news on top of bad news. Yet the strange part was, these weren’t outraged fans demanding change from the league. They were as concerned about players as they were worried about losing the essence of the one sport America is most deeply attached to, perhaps addicted to. There was no way for Goodell to know that, seven hours later, his league would have just experienced the exact type of game it needs. Fans and players were in for an epic double-overtime victory by the underdogs, a game of almost Biblical proportions that will go down as one of the greatest games in playoff history, a 4-hour-11-minute affair that reminded us – despite all of the very scary and very real problems that the league currently faces – what we love about this game, and what it teaches us about life. Just listen to what Ravens head coach John Harbaugh told reporters after rookie Justin Tucker kicked the game-winning 47-yard field goal a few minutes into the second overtime for a 38-35 Ravens upset: “Thanks for bearing witness to one of the greatest football games you’re ever going to see.” Or Ray Lewis, the 37-year-old soon-to-be-retired linebacker who tore a triceps muscle in October then made 17 tackles on Saturday: “I’ve never been a part of a game so crazy in my life.” Exaggerations? Hardly. This game was billed as Legend vs. Legend, Peyton Manning’s high-powered Denver offense facing off with Ray Lewis’ stout Baltimore defense. As it turned out, it was so much more than that. Nobody gave the Ravens, a nine-point underdog, much of a chance. They were an old team, and it looked like a revitalized Manning would make this the final game of Lewis’ career. He’d just completed the second-most productive passing season of his Hall of Fame career; the Broncos’ home-field advantage in the altitude and the sub-freezing temperatures of Denver was too great; and the Ravens' own quarterback, the good-but-not-great Joe Flacco, could in no way overcome the Broncos’ second-ranked defense. One season after the Broncos gave up on Tim Tebow, Peyton Manning's INT in OT led to a devastating Denver loss — something Tebow's brother was very pleased about on Twitter. It sure seemed that way at first. Flacco’s offense got 18 yards on its first five plays and then had to punt. Trindon Holliday, the Broncos’ return man and the shortest (and arguably the speediest) player in the league, caught the punt over his shoulder, paused a half-second, sprinted right and then busted into the open field. Ninety yards later the Broncos were up a touchdown, Holliday had the record for longest punt return in playoff history, and the predicted blowout seemed under way. Until one minute and 43 seconds later, when Ravens wideout Torrey Smith beat Champ Bailey, and Flacco lofted a perfect 59-yard pass to Smith for a touchdown. It was 7-7, and Manning hadn’t touched the ball. When he did touch the ball, it wasn’t pretty. His second pass of the game was tipped and fell into the hands of Ravens cornerback Corey Graham, who returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. What was going on here, exactly? Suddenly we all remembered: The great Peyton Manning wasn’t always so great. This was the 23rd time he had an interception returned for a touchdown in his career, and he has a losing playoff record. Ah, but he was still Peyton Manning. An 11-play, 74-yard, copyrighted Peyton Manning drive tied the game on a stop-and-go route by Knowshon Moreno. An 8-play, 86-yard typically Manning drive put the Broncos ahead. Flacco was going deep and missing again and again, to Smith and to Anquan Boldin, until he finally connected on a terrific 32-yard pass to Smith, who adjusted and jumped over a defender, tying the game just before half. Momentum again ping-ponged back to the Ravens. At halftime, Lewis gathered his team together in the locker room. He had them recite the beginning of a Bible verse, Isaiah 54:17, that they’d recited all week: “No weapon forged against us shall prevail.” Left unsaid was the second part of that Bible verse: “And you will refute every tongue that accuses you.” Plenty of media tongues, this one included, didn’t give the Ravens a chance. Those words had struck an everybody-doubts-us chord, and here the Ravens were, all tied up. But setting the dramatic tone for the second half, the Broncos’ David once again struck. The shortest man in the NFL took the opening kickoff and returned it 104 yards for a touchdown, becoming the only player in NFL playoff history to return a kickoff and a punt for a touchdown in a playoff game. Impressive? Even more so when you consider Holliday had been cut by the 5-0 Houston Texans in October – then came to Denver, where his team went on an 11-0 run. But a fumble by Manning gave the Ravens excellent field position, and five straight runs by Ray Rice ended in a touchdown and knotted it up going into the fourth quarter. Then, of course, Manning went back to being Manning: a 10-play, 77-yard drive, heavy on audibles and balanced between run and pass, that put the Broncos up, 35-28, with a bit over 7 minutes left. A Ravens drive stalled. A Broncos drive did, too. But there wasn’t much time left. When the Ravens got the ball back with 69 seconds left, down seven with no timeouts and 77 yards to go, an upset at Mile High seemed all but impossible. “That was what we spoke about: ‘What if we do the impossible?’ ” Lewis said afterward. “Man says it is not possible. God says, ‘I do the impossible.’ ” And with 30 seconds left in the game and 70 yards still to go, Flacco, the quarterback everyone loves to doubt, did the impossible. Jacoby Jones saw the Broncos defense was in a Cover 2. He noticed the safety, Rahim Moore, was cheating up. Jones took off hard down the sideline, looked up, and there was the ball. “I said, ‘Damn it, Joe threw it,’ ” Jones said about the touchdown pass. “I couldn’t even dance, I had to thank God, and I’m a dancing fool.” With less than a minute left in regulation and no timeouts, the Ravens stunned the Broncos on a game-tying bomb before winning in double-OT. See the shocking play. Jones' touchdown marked the sixth time this game was tied. Overtime began. The Ravens couldn’t move the ball past midfield. Then the Broncos couldn’t move the ball past midfield. Then Flacco, backed into his own end zone on a third-and-13, completed yet another against-all-odds pass, a 24-yard first down to his tight end, Dennis Pitta. After the Ravens punted, Manning got the ball, and he started driving, and you had a feeling that this was going to be a storybook ending for a Manning game. Until he was pressured out of the pocket, he rolled to the right, he threw across his body to Brandon Stokley, and Graham jumped the pass for his second interception. Manning slapped the side of his own helmet as he trudged to the sideline. “Yeah – bad throw,” Manning said afterward. “Probably the decision (wasn’t) great either. I thought I had an opening, and I didn’t get enough on it.” Three plays later the rookie kicker went through his pre-kick routine. He walked onto the field. The ball sailed through the uprights. The Denver crowd got stone-cold silent in the sub-zero windchill, and the Ravens celebrated. Boldin sprinted toward the locker room, did the Mile High Salute at Broncos fans, and yelled, “Go home!” Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo shouted into a camera, over and over, “Nobody gave us a chance!” Lewis strutted into the tunnel and let out a primal, incoherent scream. The doors to the locker room opened, and Ray Rice, the short, speedy running back who’d run for 131 yards and a touchdown, stood out front to receive the media horde. “We welcome you all who doubted us!” he shouted. “All of you are welcome. I promise you’re welcome in here.” “We are Invictus: unconquerable souls,” smiled Jacoby Jones. Tucker, the kicker, stood by a sign that read, “PLAY LIKE A RAVEN,” and soaked in the adulation from his pressure-packed moment. “I don’t know if this was the best moment of my life – there’s a lot more to live for than kicking a ball through some uprights – but it was definitely up there,” he said. It was easy to forget, in the afterglow of the fourth-longest playoff game in NFL history, that only a few hours before the commissioner of this league was speaking about trying to combat the very serious medical problems that will someday affect the men who’d just played one of the most drama-packed games of the year. We should never just give lip service to these medical issues. It’s hypocritical at best for us to attack the NFL in the morning, then praise it at night. But Saturday’s magical, unexpected game reminded us of what we do love about this game. Games like this remind us — despite all the violence, and all the darkness, and all the worries about how football is killing us yet we can’t seem to quit it — how much good there can be and often is in this game. Afterward, Ray Lewis, one of the NFL’s most complicated characters, stood at the podium in a three-piece charcoal suit and a paisley tie. The only way he could top this game? Win the next week. Beat the next set of doubters. Show his fans that they too could overcome, that they too can set their mind to something and achieve it. “That’s the beautiful part about sports,” Lewis said. “That’s the thing that, if I probably will miss anything about my career, it will be to listen to people say what you can’t do – and then go do it.

88,"Detroit Pistons coach Lawrence Frank wasn't pleased with how his team faltered down the stretch in its last game, but the result was yet another win. Continued production from the Pistons' bench could continue that run, especially with the lowly Charlotte Bobcats in town. The Pistons go for their first five-game winning streak in three seasons - and their sixth consecutive victory over the Bobcats - on Sunday night. Up by as many as 19 points in the third quarter, Detroit was outscored 22-11 in the final period of Friday's 85-84 victory over Atlanta. Rookie Andre Drummond's blocked shot as time expired helped the Pistons improve to 4-0 on a homestand that ends Sunday. Detroit has won six of seven since a six-game slide and is now trying to win five straight for the first time since Dec. 4-12, 2009. The Pistons also have a chance for their first 6-0 surge at home since a seven-game stretch from March 14-April 4, 2008. Detroit won five in a row at home from Nov. 18-Dec. 3, but it followed that with a five-game skid at Auburn Hills. ""Obviously, we're going to have to be sharper and better down the stretch,"" said Frank said. ""We did a good job in the paint and a good job on the boards, but there is a lot to clean up after this one."" While closing out teams is an obvious concern for a team that's been playing catch-up ever since its franchise-worst 0-8 start, Frank has to be thrilled with his bench production. Led by Will Bynum (97 points), Charlie Villanueva (78), Austin Daye (68) and Drummond (62), the Pistons' reserves are averaging 52.4 points over the last seven games. ""We're playing really well as a unit right now,"" said Daye, who scored a season-best 20 on Friday. ""I think the starters are feeding off of us, and we're feeding off of them."" It didn't work that way for the Bobcats (8-24) in a 106-104 loss to Cleveland on Friday when their starters had two fewer points than former Piston Ben Gordon (27 points) and Ramon Sessions (20), who became the third set of teammates in franchise history to score 20 or more off the bench in a game. Gordon (13.4 points per game) and Sessions (14.4) give rookie coach Mike Dunlap one of the highest-scoring bench tandems in the league, but that doesn't address a defense giving up 103.8 points per contest. Charlotte is yielding a league-worst 53.6 first-half points per game after falling behind 62-48 at the break on Friday. ""The lesson learned here is we can't come out flat as a tack and give up those kind of points early,"" said Dunlap, whose team failed to win consecutive games for the first time since Nov. 19-21 and has dropped 19 of 20. Detroit is hitting 46.2 percent from beyond the arc and outscoring its opponents by an average of 10.6 points in the first half its last seven contests. The Pistons led by at least 12 at the break in three of the four games against the Bobcats last season. The exception was a 110-107 overtime victory on March 31, when Detroit rallied from eight points down with three minutes left in regulation to improve to 11-3 at home in this series.",Raw Data

First Take's Rob Parker apologized for his controversial RG3 comments, and now ESPN has suspended the personality for 30 days. Put on your thinking caps and open your minds as I try to explain to you how the corruptive forces of America’s illicit drug war and mass incarceration can be seen in ESPN’s morning debate festival First Take. The show has been in the news the past week because its part-time clown, Rob Parker, gleefully swallowed Skip Bayless’ bait and discussed Robert Griffin III’s “blackness” in the most racist way possible. Among other things, Parker insinuated RG3 was a “cornball” brother not “down for the cause” because he’s engaged to a white woman and there are rumors Griffin is a Republican. To the delight and entertainment of his puppeteer (Bayless), Parker did this on national TV. ESPN was originally so pleased with the segment that it re-ran it during its daily 30-minute best-of show. The Worldwide Leader did not recognize the inappropriateness and unfairness of Parker’s commentary until the blogosphere and social media exploded with an angry backlash. Within 24 hours, Parker was suspended indefinitely. Six days later, Parker apologized for his stupidity and racism. And on the seventh day, ESPN announced Parker’s indefinite suspension would last 30 days and First Take would receive additional editorial oversight. What took so long? And why the wrist slaps for something this grossly unfair? Previously, I’ve explained that First Take is a black barbershop conversation. “Black enough” conversations are a frequent topic in black barbershops. President Obama’s “blackness” is dissected on a daily basis, as is President Clinton’s (I’m not joking). Unless you’re covered in tatts, have more than three baby mamas or are currently working regular shifts selling bean pies and Final Calls for the Fruit of Islam, your blackness can and likely will be questioned at some point inside a black barbershop. For decades — even centuries — intelligent human life forms were able to distinguish the difference between conversations appropriate for the barbershop and not appropriate for mass broadcast distribution. There’s a lot of sex talk inside the barbershops I frequent. Brothers lose it when Josina Anderson appears on ESPN. Should this be a segment on First Take? Our public conversations are being dumbed down. Why? Because there’s a growing mass of American humanity demanding a dumbed-down conversation they can access. In the week since Parker unleashed his stupidity, I’ve heard from countless black men via Twitter and email who believe Parker did nothing wrong and was only bringing up an issue that the black community is discussing. Gregory Lee, the president of National Association of Black Journalists, told the blog TheBigLead.com that he understood what Parker was trying to say but Parker’s “execution was poor.” Yeah. There’s a right way to publicly question the blackness of a 22-year-old kid quarterback? OK. This kid excelled academically and athletically in college. He carries himself in a spectacularly classy manner. But these aren’t “black enough” qualities? OK. Griffin has the characteristics that would’ve made him beloved by black folks in the 1960s and 1970s, but now he’s a target of Black McCarthyism. Why? Bob Costas joins FOXSports.com's Jason Whitlock to talk about the Jovan Belcher controversy. The mass incarceration created by our immoral war on drugs. Mass incarceration corrupts the values of a free society. We wrongly think our world-leading incarceration rate makes our society more civil and safe. It is rotting our core, polluting our values, unleashing corruptive forces that powered the Wall Street mortgage crisis, the urban warfare we read about every day and all the other forms of greed-induced fraudulence plaguing America. It’s not just the prisoner who is corrupted by the degradation of incarceration. It’s the jailer, too. It’s the community that houses the prison. It’s the loved ones of the prisoner and the prison employees. It’s society as a whole. Our love of guns and paranoid preparation for a race war are fueled by the paranoia and race tension found within prison walls. The unfairness of the drug war and mass incarceration breed a bitterness and cynicism throughout society that undermines our ability to see the characteristics that bind us, to see the good and necessity of working together. Despite the myths spawned by Grover Norquist and other Ronald Reagan groupies, the Soviet Union collapsed from the internal wounds of mass incarceration not because of Reagan’s military might and foreign policy. The Soviet Union couldn’t withstand the pervasive corruption. We can’t either. 'Griffining' is great, but what about these other famous NFL poses? Let me take this back to First Take, the show that features barbershop conversation. A common trade learned in prison is barber. I’d estimate that a good 10 to 15 percent of black barbers have been incarcerated. Who sits around at a barbershop talking all day? Who frequents barbershops selling colognes and hot clothes? Ex-cons. The unemployed. Who is at home with the free time to watch First Take at 10 a.m. every weekday? Nightshift workers and the unemployed. The unemployment rate for black men is around 13 to 14 percent. I’d think that number is significantly higher for black male ex-cons. First Take is catering to a growing demographic. Rob Parker at one time owned a barbershop in Detroit — “Sporty Cutz,” I believe, was the name. He knows the demographic well. He knows what they talk about and what they want to see talked about on TV. He and ESPN are not trying to elevate the conversation and uplift the victims of America’s mass incarceration crime. Parker and ESPN simply want to make a buck, no different from the corporations building prisons all across America.",Raw Data

91,"With second place in Group H already tied up boss Andrea Stramaccioni made seven changes as he gave a run-out to a host of his youth team players. Livaja seemingly set the stage for a comfortable night when he fired a ninth-minute opener and while Inter dominated Neftchi equalised through Rashad Sadygov on 52 minutes. Livaja took two minutes to respond, firing his fourth goal of a European campaign that has marked the 19-year-old Croatian as a future star, but again Neftchi equalised through Canales' late header. Livaja was the most notable young player in the much-changed Inter line-up and he immediately made his mark after poor defending allowed Alvaro Perreira's cross to get through to him at the back post. Inter should have added to their lead before half-time but failed to make their dominance count. Philippe Coutinho saw a shot deflected off Igor Mitreski and Jonathan's run and shot was only kept out by Neftchi goalkeeper Sasa Stamenkovic's outstretched foot. Walter Samuel shaved the post after getting his head to a Coutinho free-kick while 18-year-old Luca Garritano's ambitious volley sailed wide. Inter's profligacy was temporarily punished seven minutes after half-time when Sadygov smacked a 25-yarder into the top-right corner. Yuto Nagatomo, who came on for Garritano immediately after the equaliser, made a difference with his first touch as he crossed for Livaja to head in from the centre of the area. Livaja was denied a hat-trick by Emin Mehdiyev's timely block inside the six-yard box before Nagamoto thumped a shot against the crossbar late on.

The greatest threat to any throne is the one the ruler doesn’t see. Many lovers of my favorite TV show ""The Wire"" were disappointed by Omar’s demise at the tiny trigger finger of a child. It was brilliant. Robert Baratheon, the king in season one of ""Game of Thrones,"" fell victim to his queen’s conniving. He underestimated her ambition. Tupac warred with the East while his problems festered in his beloved West. As this NBA season turns for the homestretch, I wonder what King James sees. There is a threat to his throne that no one sees, an enemy so infantile and raw that I’m reluctant to mention his name out of fear of being ridiculed, an adversary without a national following and a lukewarm local one. Does King James see Paul George coming? No one else does. On Sunday, the Pacers' 22-year-old, 6-foot-8 swingman made his All-Star Game debut. He was spectacular, scoring 17 points —which included dropping two 3-pointers in the final two minutes as the East frantically closed a double-digit deficit to within reasonable striking distance. No one took notice of 2013’s most unlikely All-Star. There was more discussion of Kyrie Irving’s premiere and Kobe’s two fourth-quarter blocks of LeBron shots. We missed the story. Paul George is Lil Kenard, the baby Omar assassin who no one saw coming despite the clever hints David Simon, creator of ""The Wire,"" placed throughout seasons four and five. Sunday’s All-Star Game stands as a hint that George has an assassin’s heart. Feel free to dismiss the NBA All-Star Game as a glorified pickup game. It is. But that does not make the game irrelevant for picking up clues about the psyche of its combatants. NBA All-Star Weekend is unlike all the other meaningless all-star affairs. Winning the home-run derby tells you nothing about what Prince Fielder is going to do in the clutch. Larry Bird’s dominance of the 3-point shooting contest and Michael Jordan’s victory over Dominique Wilkins in the dunk contest explained Larry Legend’s and Air Jordan’s souls. OK, the stars no longer compete in the NBA skills competitions. All we have left is the game. The game is still significant. It’s perhaps the greatest televised clash of ginormous egos outside of our nation’s capital. Winning may be irrelevant. Shining is not. Guys want to shine. Normally they must wait. Jordan scored seven points in his All-Star debut. OK, Isiah Thomas allegedly organized a freeze out. Jordan scored 11 points in his second All-Star Game. Bird tallied seven points in his debut. So did Charles Barkley. Magic put up 12. LeBron scored 13. Since 1980, the arrival of the new NBA era, 19 men have won the league’s regular-season MVP award. Of those winners, only four — Kobe, Dr. J, Allen Iverson and Karl Malone — have scored more points in their All-Star Game debut than Paul George. Dr. J was a grown-ass man, an ABA legend and a superstar when he dropped 30 points in the 1977 NBA All-Star Game. Malone (22 points) feasted on Magic’s 19 assists in the ’88 game. Iverson and Kobe scored 26 and 20, respectively. What George accomplished is rare. The list of great names who did less in their All-Star debuts is impressive and endless. It takes a massive ego, a great deal of talent and uncontrolled ambition to take shots away from LeBron, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in an All-Star Game. It takes big paws on a puppy. These 10 NBA players are the ones to watch after the All-Star break. Paul George has that. He’s been displaying them this season. But it’s the NBA, and no one pays attention to the regular season, especially the portion of the season that takes place before the All-Star Game, before the NFL relinquishes its stranglehold on our attention. Before I go further, let me admit that I’m a lifelong Pacers fan. The Pacers can and do make me cry tears of joy and sorrow. I grew up going to Pacers ABA games at The Fairgrounds with my dad and brother. I had my mother run a hot comb through my hair so I could mimic Darnell Hillman's afro. I had “B.Knight” emblazoned on the back of my favorite T-shirt to honor Billy Knight, not Bobby. I loved Alex English before he was a star in Denver. I hated George Irvine for trying to make Wayman Tisdale a put-it-on-the-floor, face-the-basket small forward. I cussed at Donnie Walsh for not drafting Adrian Branch in the second round. I cried like a baby when Reggie beat down the Knicks and Spike Lee. I’m a Pacers homer. But I never saw Paul George coming. I began this season convinced the Pacers were fatally flawed pretenders. Last year’s entertaining and competitive second-round playoff series with LeBron and the Heat was fool’s gold, in my mind. King James erupted for 40 in Game 4 and the Pacers folded. Larry Bird, then the team’s president, basically called the Pacers cowards. I saw a team that was poorly constructed, a team built for Bird’s 1980s. No one could put it on the floor, attack the rim and get to the free-throw line. Danny Granger, the team’s best player, was a spot-up shooter — a poor man’s Reggie Miller. Roy Hibbert was a decent option on the low block, but he was a turnover waiting to happen at crunch time. The bench offered few solutions. George didn’t know how to complete a simple entry pass into the low post, and his shaky ball-handling skills prevented him from getting into the lane. When they were bounced from the playoffs, I went on Indianapolis radio and called for the roster to be overhauled. You can’t win in the modern NBA without at least one player who can consistently get to the rim and create his own shot or a shot for others. When the Pacers started 10-11 this season, I went back on Indianapolis radio and again called for the roster to be blown up. I didn’t see Paul George coming. Who knew? Who knew Granger’s sore knee, an injury that has kept him sidelined the first 53 games of the season, would be the greatest gift in Pacers history? With no Granger and a 10-11 season start, Pacers coach Frank Vogel overhauled his offense (adding more free-wheeling motion) and turned the team over to a third-year kid from Fresno State. Who knew? Who knew these changes would lead George to unveil a Kevin Durant impersonation? If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: I’m not calling George the next Durant. He doesn’t have Durant’s flawless, lightning release. No one does. But I’m not sure Durant gets to the rim as well as George does now or will in the future when he gets more respect from the refs and when Granger’s floor-spacing jump shot returns to the lineup. Durant certainly doesn’t defend as well as George. Vogel is Khaleesi, the mother of dragons, and George is his baby dragon. This three-star recruit who chose Fresno State over Pepperdine has all the necessary ingredients to be the greatest Pacer. Reggie Miller is in the Hall of Fame and led the Pacers to the NBA Finals with 75 percent of George's raw talent. Yeah, maybe I'm dreaming, but I truly believe anything is possible with Paul George, including a playoff upset of the Heat this season. The Pacers have gone 22-10 since their awful start. They inexplicably gave away two home games right before the All-Star break. My point is they are five or six wins better than their 32-21 record. If they were 37-16 and nipping at the Heat, someone might suspect Indiana was a real threat to the crown. If they were 37-16 and poised to get the services of a 29-year-old former All-Star capable of scoring 20 points a night (Granger), someone might send a raven to King James warning that an army is headed for King’s Landing. The Pacers are one of the best defensive teams in the league. Hibbert, for all of his offensive shortcomings and mental collapse since receiving a max contract, protects the rim. Vogel is a really good coach. David West is a terrific offensive option in the final four minutes. Lance Stephenson is the right kind of idiot. He’s fearless, athletic and super competitive. He’s the perfect guy to defend Dwyane Wade. Granger is going to dramatically improve Indiana’s depth and inconsistent offense. Obviously the Baby Dragon is the key. George has to continue to evolve. Granger’s addition should improve George’s offensive numbers — scoring and shooting percentage — not inhibit them. Most important, George should leave All-Star weekend feeling like a legitimate superstar. What Kobe Bryant did late in the All-Star Game — taking the fight to King James — is what the Baby Dragon should emulate moving forward. George has the youth, energy, tools and athleticism to challenge King James for four quarters. George can bother James in ways Durant simply cannot. The Pacers are the threat no one sees. They play defense better than the Heat. They rebound better than the Heat. They have a better coach than the Heat. They have far more size than the Heat. Their ""trade-deadline"" acquisition (adding a healthy Granger) is exactly what they need (a scorer), as long as he's willing to accept playing second fiddle to George. OK, there’s no substitute for King James. None. What he’s doing this year is unprecedented. But I’m telling you we’re looking in all the wrong places for his greatest threat. It’s not the Thunder. LeBron has OKC figured out. It’s not the Celtics. They’re too beat up. It’s not the Bulls. LeBron swallowed a perfectly healthy Derrick Rose. It’s not the Knicks. Carmelo doesn’t really want the throne. It’s not the Spurs. They made the mistake of standing pat. This is a completely different Pacers team from a year ago. Last season, Granger pretended to be a trash-talking tough guy, and the Pacers jumped to a 2-1 advantage over the Heat. Paul George is not a pretender. He’s a real baby dragon. He’s the problem LeBron doesn’t see.",Raw Data
93,"NASCAR star Denny Hamlin makes a television appearance with Stephanie Ready on Bobcats LIVE. Josh D. Weiss-US PRESSWIRE Check out all the cheerleaders of Fox Sports South. VIEW GALLERY » CHARLOTTE – Denny Hamlin looked out across the Time Warner Cable Arena an hour before Wednesday’s Hawks-Bobcats game as the players and the Lady Cats cheerleaders went through their pregame routines, Guns N’ Roses’ Welcome to The Jungle blaring through the speakers. The NASCAR star settled in front of a camera, the logo for the Daytona 500 filling the jumbotron behind him as he filmed a series of promos and a Hawks LIVE interview with Andre Aldridge. He was there to discuss his driving in the Great American Race, which airs Feb. 24 on FOX, along with a connection to the Bobcats, which is evident in both his personal and professional life. “[I’ve] definitely got a lot of ties [to the Bobcats],” he said. Hamlin attended his first game in 2007 at the invitation of someone with courtside seats and was immediately hooked. “I had watched basketball only a little bit on TV, never been to a game in person,” he said. “But ever since then I was like ‘Wow, this is a whole different experience when (you) get down here how physical the game is' and fueled my passion for basketball I haven’t had since really I was a teenager.” He became a season-ticket holder the following year and would go on to meet a pair of Jordans: his girlfriend, former Lady Cat Jordan Fish and Hall of Famer and Bobcats owner Michael Jordan. Hamlin and Fish welcomed their first child -- daughter Taylor James Hamlin – on Jan. 20 and Michael Jordan, who divulged to Hamlin that he watches every Sprint Cup race, has his iconic Jumpman logo on Hamlin’s firesuit. “I asked him, ‘Hey, what do you think about a Jordan Brand firesuit,’” Hamlin said. “He loved the idea and he called up his people to get it done and obviously that’s where it all started.” Before taking his seat for the game Hamlin made an appearance on the Bobcats LIVE set opposite Stephanie Ready, the concourse behind them bustling with fans as tip-off neared. Hamlin was given a gift in a blue bag with orange tissue paper inside – Bobcats colors – and as he walked from the set I asked him what was inside. “A Bobcats onesie,” he said, smiling as he produced the navy blue shirt with the team logo. * * * Already, Hamlin is seeing the possibilities the newest evolution of the Sprint Cup car presents. Increased downforce. More grip. After two tests in the Gen-6 car -- which replaces the Car of Tomorrow – at Daytona International Speedway and Charlotte Motor Speedway, Hamlin expects to see lap times drop dramatically. “We’re going to be running record speeds at every track we run at this year,” he said. “It’s exciting from that standpoint, but it’s going to be interesting to see what happens when you get 43 cars out there. How are they going to react to each other?” It’s a car that many expect to bring an end to the tandem racing that, to the chagrin of many fans and drivers, defined the restrictor-plate races of late, and bring a return to the pack racing of old. When Hamlin climbs into his No. 11 Toyota at Daytona, he’ll also be doing it with a new teammate at Joe Gibbs Racing in Matt Kenseth. The 2003 series champion and winner of 24 races, Kenseth left Roush Fenway Racing after 13 years to move to JGR, where he takes over the No. 20 from Joey Logano (who is now at Penske Racing). “He’s got so much experience, he’s won the Daytona 500 more than once, he’s got his championship, so to me he’s going to be a reliable source,” Hamlin said. “The thing is that our three-car team, we never had all of our cars running up front at the same time, where we could use information from both Kyle (Busch) and Joey. “Now we have a guy we know is going to make the Chase, who we know is going to be up front, so I think he’s going to make our race team better.” For Hamlin, the goal is clear, and so is the path. He’s made the Chase every year since moving to Cup full time in ’06 and has finished second (’10) and third (’06) in the points, but a title has eluded him. Hamlin believes if he can win at least six races and post 18-19 top-five finishes and 23-24 top 10s, he should be in the running for a title when the series hits Homestead-Miami Speedway on Nov. 17. “For us, every year is championship or nothing,” he said. “So I know exactly in my head what we need to be a championship contender. We’re taking it seriously and we need to capitalize on these championship runs that we’re making.” * * * Hamlin took his seat minutes before the Hawks and Bobcats introductions. It’s a courtside vantage point directly next to the visitor’s bench that has allowed him earlier this season to take a picture with the Knicks’ J.R. Smith, but he won’t be riling up the Bobcats’ competition. “No,” he said. “The other team’s coach is sitting right by me.” With 5:16 remaining in the first quarter Hamlin joined the Bobcats announcing team of Steve Martin and Dell Curry before sitting in with the Hawks duo of Bob Rathbun and Dominique Wilkins. Along with discussing Daytona, Hamlin said he offered up his own in-game analysis. “I just said Atlanta was playing big, so we should be able to run on them,” Hamlin said. The Bobcats took his advice, cutting the Hawks’ lead to seven points with 5:40 left in the game but after a Johan Petro 3-pointer and a Josh Smith jumper, Atlanta was back in charge and en route to a 104-92 victory. Hamlin disclosed that this was the longest he had been away since the birth of his daughter and when asked if he was excited to get back to them, he quickly responded “Yeah, definitely.” The new father went home bearing a gift, one that came wrapped in a color scheme that looms large in his new family.",Raw Data
94,"Suarez was virtually unplayable as Liverpool bounced back from a week to forget by hoisting themselves into seventh place in the Premier League. The Uruguayans name appears on the score sheet just once but his performance was much more valuable than that contribution alone. He was involved in four of Liverpools goals, including his own, and caused mayhem in the Swansea rearguard throughout. No wonder he received a standing ovation from an appreciative Anﬁ eld crowd when he was hauled off after 78 minutes. He looked dejected at the decision to remove him from the action but manager Brendan Rodgers said that was a typical response from the striker. Rodgers said: ""He has played nearly every minute of every game. He has been brilliant for us and I wanted him to get a round of applause. But he wanted to continue and thats the nature of the guy. He just wanted to carry on playing for every minute of the game."" After a week in which Liverpool had suffered Premier League defeat by West Brom and a Europa League setback in St Petersburg, a win was essential. And they delivered the goods against Rodgerss old club as they quelled mounting frustration among their fans  at least for the time being. But they were certainly helped along by a much-changed Swansea team that was on the ropes for long periods. With one eye clearly on next Sundays Capital One Cup Final at Wembley, Swansea boss Michael Laudrup made seven changes from his last team selection. It was the kind of move that Liverpool had to take full advantage of  and thats precisely what they did. The biggest surprise was that the margin of victory wasnt greater against a team that showed little resistance. Rodgers said: ""It was an important three points. We have had a bumpy road this week and had to show some commitment in this game. It was an outstanding performance and we showed plenty of character and overall I am very pleased. But Swansea boss Laudrup said frankly: It was a nightmare. We got slaughtered and it was awful. We just have to say sorry to the fans who travelled. I am responsible as I pick the team. We made changes but that is no excuse. There have been changes in the last couple of months and we have still got results. I thought we were capable of getting a result, but I am wrong. We did not compete at all and it could have been 10-0."" Liverpool took the lead after Suarez had been upended in the penalty area by Kemy Agustien following a 33rd-minute Steven Gerrard corner. Gerrard, who had a penalty saved against West Brom last Monday, made no mistake this time round with a low shot to the right of keeper Michel Vorm. The goal capped an opening spell of almost complete Liverpool dominance in which Swansea had their backs right against the wall. Any hopes that the Swans may have harboured about a ﬁghtback were then dashed with three goals in the opening 12 minutes of the second half. Philippe Coutinho, making his full debut after his £8.5m January move from Inter Milan, rounded off a ﬁne move within 16 seconds of the restart. He received a great pass from Suarez before slotting the ball past Vorm. Jose Enrique then popped up with only his second goal for Liverpool after combining well in an excellent one-two with Daniel Sturridge after 50 minutes. To compound Swanseas misery, Suarez virtually strolled through their defence before riﬂing in a 57th-minute right-foot shot. Sturridge then joined in on the goalscoring act by hammering home a 71st minute penalty after Suarez had been barged in the box by sub Wayne Routledge. It really did turn out to be a day on which Liverpool had a shoot-on-sight policy with Suarez and Sturridge leading the way. The only downside for Liverpool was a suspected dislocated shoulder to sub Fabio Borini, who could be out for the rest of the season.",Raw Data
95,"A.J. Perez previously worked at USA Today, AOL and CBSSports.com covering beats ranging from performance-enhancing drugs to the NHL. AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. Robert Griffin III suffered a Grade 1 lateral collateral ligament (LCL) sprain in his right knee and Washington Redskins coach Mike Shanahan told reporters Monday that his franchise rookie quarterback is ""definitely not ruled out"" of Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns. ""You just never know,"" Shanahan said. ""When I looked at it on film, I thought it was going to be worse than it was."" The injury occurred in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter in Sunday's 31-28 overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens. Griffin scrambled for a 13-yard gain and was hit by Ravens lineman Haloti Ngata, a collision that caused Griffin's right leg to whip violently. Griffin underwent an MRI after the game. Shanahan said Monday that Griffin is day to day and he will be evaluated during the week. He also doesn't know if Griffin would practice on Wednesday. The LCL runs down the outside of the knee and is one of the four major ligaments that stabilizes the joint. Tears and sprains are graded on a scale from 1 to 3 with Grade 1 being the least serious. Griffin's injury is in the same knee that was surgically repaired while he was at Baylor in 2009, a procedure performed by Houston-based orthopedic surgeon and FOXSports.com NFL injuries columnist Mark Adickes. Adickes said that those who have reconstructive knee surgery are more susceptible to future injury, although the relative minor injury that resulted from Sunday's scary collision is a testament to Griffin's work ethic in years since surgery. ""I could definitely see him back out there on Sunday,"" said Adickes, a former offensive lineman with the Redskins. ""I don't think they will send him out there unless the knee has heeled to the degree that he's mobile enough to perform. It's largely about pain. The body will shut down as a means to protecting itself (if the pain is too intense)."" Adickes said that a Grade 1 LCL sprain can sometimes be more more painful than more severe injuries to the ligament. Shanahan said coaches tutor Griffin each week on how he can better protect himself, although he didn't fault Griffin for this latest injury. ""What Robert was trying to do was score a touchdown,"" Shanahan said. ""It's what competitors do. He's trying to make a play. It was like a playoff game for us because we knew we had to win. ""Most quarterbacks, at least the quarterbacks we would want, would put themselves in that situation."" Shanahan, knowing full well that it makes the other team work extra to prepare for two quarterbacks, will no doubt wait as long as possible to publicly commit one way or the other to Griffin, the NFL's top-rated quarterback, or fellow rookie Kirk Cousins. ''Both of them will have a game plan,'' Shanahan said Monday. A Grade 1 sprain typically means the ligament is stretched or has some minor tears and usually doesn't require surgery. Griffin will get multiple treatments daily and will probably have to wear a brace for several weeks. The next major benchmark is whether Griffin will able to take part when practice resumes on Wednesday. ''You're hoping with rehab it gets better very quickly,'' Shanahan said. ''But we don't know for sure. ... He's definitely not ruled out for the Cleveland game.'' Griffin's father, Robert Griffin Jr., said in a text message that his son was ''feeling good'' and that ''we will know by Thursday'' whether Griffin III will be able to suit up against the Browns. The most severe knee injury usually associated with sports is a season-ending torn ACL, the anterior cruciate ligament. Griffin tore the ACL in his right knee while playing for Baylor in 2009, but Shanahan said Griffin's reconstructed ACL ''looks great'' and that there's ''no problem there.'' ''He's doing good. He's in high spirits,'' left tackle Trent Williams said after speaking with Griffin on Monday. ''It was a pretty nasty, awkward hit, and for him not to be seriously injured is a blessing.'' No. 2 overall pick Griffin has become a phenomenon in his debut NFL season, leading the Redskins, a team that went 5-11 last year, to four straight victories to put their record at 7-6, one game behind the first-place New York Giants in the NFC East. His performance Sunday put him atop the league with a 104.2 passer rating, better than Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and everyone else. Fourth-rounder Cousins might not be much of a drop-off, especially after his super-sub performance against the Ravens. When Griffin left for one play, Cousins converted a third-and-6 with a pass to Pierre Garcon that drew a pass interference penalty on Chris Johnson. When Griffin left for good later in the drive, Cousins completed two passes in two plays, and his nice pump fake allowed Garcon to get open for an 11-yard touchdown with 29 seconds left in regulation. Cousins then did his best RG3 impersonation, running the quarterback draw on the 2-point conversion to tie the game. ''You're running the scout team the majority of the time, and you're expected to go in there and perform,'' Shanahan said. ''So there's a lot of pressure on people. Some people can handle it; other people can't. But when you prepare yourself like he has, it didn't surprise me that he was flawless in what he did.'' Shanahan defended the decision to have Griffin return to the game for four plays after the injury, saying he left the decision in the hands of Dr. James Andrews, the renowned sports physician who is on the sidelines for most Redskins games. ''He's the one that gives me that information,'' Shanahan said. ''It's way over my head.'' The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Raw Data

The tie will also pit Jose Mourinho against Sir Alex Ferguson in the most mouthwatering tie of the first knock-out round of Europe's top club competition. Ferguson said he would have to ""order some good wine'' - a reference to the two managers' old tradition of sharing a glass of red after their teams' encounters. Ferguson told the club's official website: ""Well, it's the tie of the round. It's a great opportunity for our fans to see Cristiano again and also for me to meet up with Jose again - I'll need to order some good wine!''

United's club secretary John Alexander hoped there was a lucky omen in the draw. He told Sky Sports News: ""Out of several standout ties, I think this is the one. ""It's the tie that everyone wanted to see - but that nobody wanted to see, they wanted to save it for later in the competition. When you think about the traditions of these two clubs they have both been incredibly successful, but of course the past is history. One thing going in our favor is that our one victory over Real Madrid in this competition was in the year we won the final at Wembley [in 1968] so let's hope that is a lucky omen."" It was another Ronaldo - the Brazilian striker - who took the honors when the clubs last faced each other in 2003, scoring a hat-trick at Old Trafford as Real went through 6-5 on aggregate. United defender Rio Ferdinand played in the 2003 match against Real Madrid, as did Ryan Giggs, while Darren Fletcher was a substitute although he did not come on. Ferdinand welcomed the draw on Twitter saying: ""Oh yes, Madrid!! What a great couple a games that'll be!! @Cristiano see u soon bro!!'' Emilio Butragueno, Real Madrid's director of institutional relations, said it would be a special match for Ronaldo and the two managers. He said on www.uefa.com: ""I am sure it will be a special game for him. He's a great professional. I'm sure he's going to do his best to help us qualify. It's going to very, very special for him. It will be a thrilling experience for everyone. Manchester United are not only a great team but a great organisation known around the world. ""But we know it's going to be tough. Sir Alex Ferguson has been there over 25 years and he's a fantastic manager. He knows how to get the best out of his players and they have top players, but we are Real Madrid and we will try our best. I know the coaches have a great relationship. We are very happy with him (Mourinho) and I hope he's going to lead the team to the Champions League to make our fans feel proud of the team."" The clubs first met in the European Cup in April 1957, when Real triumphed 5-3 in the semifinal. Cristiano Ronaldo's last match for United was in the Champions League final defeat by Barcelona, after which he moved to Madrid for a world record £80million transfer fee. United have a slight advantage over Real in that as group winners they will get to play the second leg at home. Arsenal and Celtic, who were group runners-up, will both play their second legs away. Arsene Wenger's Gunners last met Bayern Munich at the same stage in 2005, with the German side progressing 3-2 on aggregate.

98,"MIAMI Whether they're better in the first half of the regular season or in the second half really hasn't mattered when it has come to Miami Heat championships. In 2005-06, the Heat were superior in the second half. After a 24-17 start, which included Stan Van Gundy going 11-10 before being replaced as coach by Pat Riley, the Heat went 28-13 in the second half and won the NBA title. In the 66-game lockout season of 2011-12, it was the opposite. The Heat were 26-7 in the first half and 20-13 in the second en route to their second title. It remains to be seen whether this version of the Heat will be better or worse in the second half or if they'll win another title. But, for whatever it's worth, forward Shane Battier apparently can see the future. ""Our best basketball is ahead of us, which I'd rather have versus our best basketball behind us,"" he said. The Heat are 27-12, which is tops in the Eastern Conference but just the fourth-best overall mark in the NBA. They reach the midpoint of the season following games Friday against Detroit and Sunday at Boston. The first half of the season has been slightly frustrating to Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who knows how good his team can be. After all, how many teams win a championship and then add a player the caliber of future Hall of Famer Ray Allen? Still, the Heat have somehow managed to lose games at Washington and Detroit. They've dropped both games they've played against New York by 20 points. And they're an unimpressive 10-9 on the road. But the Heat are an awesome 17-3 at home. And that includes a win over Oklahoma City, the team they beat in the Finals last June. ""I'm trying to figure out the areas we can get better, more consistent,"" Spoelstra said of reaching the midpoint. ""We know the areas we have to improve, so hopefully we'll do that in the second half. These games mean something We could have been a little more consistent (in the first half of the season). It might have affected our record.""' With the Heat having regularly been ranked among the NBA's worst in rebounding statistics, Spoesltra has been stressing all season hitting the boards. Perhaps the Heat finally are listening considering they walloped Toronto 53-28 on the glass in a 123-118 overtime win Wednesday. Then again, it's hard to get too excited about needing overtime to beat the lowly Raptors at home. Playing down to lesser foes has been another problem that has plagued the Heat during the first half of the season. Miami is 4-0 in overtime games. But one wonders how those games against lesser foes (Milwaukee, Dallas and Toronto at home and at Orlando) ever got that far. The Heat also have had narrow escapes at home against Cleveland and against Spurs Lite, the San Antonio team that was left after coach Gregg Popovich had sent home Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker and Danny Green to rest. ""We have letdowns during the course of a game,"" said center Chris Bosh. ""We just have to work on being consistent We haven't put our best basketball together and we're on top of the East right now. It's kind of a good feeling to know we have room for improvement."" Bosh, whose Heat are 1 1/2 games ahead of the Knicks in the East, sounds like another guy who sees in his crystal ball the Heat playing better during the second half of the regular season. It might be hard for forward LeBron James to play any better. He's averaging 26.1 points, 8.2 rebounds and 7.1 assists, and a fourth MVP trophy in five years is well within his grasp. But there's every reason to believe guard Dwyane Wade will be better in the second half. Wade, averaging 20.5 points, said he's ahead of schedule in his recovery from last July's knee surgery, and he looked fully healthy while scoring a season-high 35 points against the Raptors. But will Bosh be better? His 17.3 scoring average, in line to be his lowest since 2004-05, is a product of playing alongside future Hall of Famers James, Wade and Allen, who is averaging 11.4 in his 17th season. But there's no excuse for Bosh's 7.2 rebounding average, on pace to be the lowest of his career. ""We need double-digit rebounds (from Bosh), and it doesn't happen every night, we understand that,"" James said. ""Any time C.B. gets double-digit rebounds, we're tough to beat."" Actually, Miami is just 5-4 this season when Bosh gets 10 or more boards. But it sure would be nice if Bosh could provide a larger sample size. With consistency being the big word for Spoelstra, the Heat also will be looking for more of that in the second half from starting point guard Mario Chalmers. His scoring average is down from last's 9.8 to 7.9 and his field-goal percentage has slipped from 44.8 to 41.7. Kansas announced Thursday it will retire Chalmers' No. 15 jersey at a Feb. 16 halftime ceremony. Maybe that will put some extra pep into Chalmers. ""We want to climb as high in the homecourt (advantage) as we can,"" Battier said of a Miami goal for the second half. ""It's not the end all, be all. But we want to play well. It's not a matter of flipping a switch, it's being consistent. But our best basketball is ahead of us."" Naturally, the Heat want to be better during the second half of the regular season. But even if they're not, it's worth remembering they still won the NBA title last season without an impressive second half. Who's Hot: James is simply starting a new streak. His run of consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points ended at 54 two weeks ago at Portland. Since then, James has scored 20 or more in his last five games. Over the past four games, James has averaged 31.7 points. He had his second triple-double of the season Wednesday, totaling 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists against the Raptors. Who's Not: Mike Miller's shot has disappeared. He's 0-of-9 in the last four games he's played, including 0-of-6 from 3-point range. Miller only got in for five minutes against Toronto. After he went 0-of-4 in the second quarter, he was done for the night. Three Thoughts 1. Like it or not, Bosh is probably going to end up in the Hall of Fame. Bosh on Thursday earned his eighth All-Star trip, and only one eligible player in NBA history has not ended up in Springfield, Mass., with that many selections. That's Larry Foust, a center who played from 1950-62 and averaged 13.7 points and 9.8 rebounds. With Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki seeing his streak of consecutive All-Star selections end at 11, only Kobe Bryant (15), James (nine) and Wade (nine) have longer ongoing streaks than Bosh. 2. It's safe to say Spoelstra envies Scott Brooks, whose Oklahoma City Thunder could have the best record in the West and Brooks won't have to coach in the All-Star Game. That's because Brooks did it last year and there's a no-repeat rule. If the Heat have the best mark in the East through games of Feb. 3, Spoelstra will perhaps reluctantly head to Houston for the Feb. 17 All-Star Game. ""We'll see what happens,"" said Spoelstra, who never has sounded too excited about the prospect of coaching in the game. ""We're trying to get better as a team. My focus isn't necessarily on that.

Is it possible Chalmers won't get an extremely warm reception when Kansas retires his No. 15 at halftime of the Feb. 16 game against Texas? The Topeka Capital-Journal is conducting a poll on its website. As of late Thursday night, 68 percent believed Chalmers' overall Jayhawks career was not good enough for him to have his jersey raised to the rafters while 32 percent believed his miracle 3-pointer in the 2008 NCAA title game makes him worthy. Chalmers hit the shot that forced overtime in the eventual 75-68 win over Memphis. But Chalmers' averages of 12.2 points and 3.8 assists in three Kansas seasons hardly were impressive, and he was a second-round NBA draft pick.

99,"The newly hired general manager reached out to Darrelle Revis on Thursday, a few hours after the star cornerback wrote on Twitter that he was ''speechless'' about rampant trade rumors. Idzik told NBC's Pro Football Talk on Friday that Revis ''reacted well'' to the phone call, which came after the GM, owner Woody Johnson and coach Rex Ryan were non-committal about the cornerback's future with the team. Revis expressed his frustration on Twitter, prompting the call from Idzik, introduced as the replacement for the fired Mike Tannenbaum hours earlier. ''We haven't taken that first step, and that's what I relayed to Darrelle,'' Idzik told Pro Football Talk. Revis, recovering from a major knee injury, is expected to draw plenty of interest on the trade market. ''I made sure he knew exactly where we were coming from and that this is my first day on the job,'' Idzik said, ''and our message to everyone was, `Give us a chance to get to know each other and introduce ourselves to each other.''' A published report Wednesday night said Johnson, concerned that the Jets won't be able to re-sign Revis next year, wants to explore trade options rather than risk losing him for nothing as a free agent next winter. Revis' contract voids after the 2013 season, and he is expected to ask for around $16 million a year. Johnson would neither confirm nor deny that the report was true, adding that he didn't know where it came from. Idzik and Ryan, who has repeatedly called Revis one of the best players he has ever coached, were also non-committal about the player's future. ''I'm not going to get into any of those specifics right now,'' Ryan said. ''I think, let's let the process run its course and I'm confident that any decision made, that this organization (makes), will be without question in the best interest of this football team.'' Revis missed most of this past season with a torn ligament in his left knee, but Johnson said Thursday that it appears the cornerback's rehabilitation is going as planned. ''I saw Darrelle the other day and if you looked at Darrelle, I think he's going to come back and be 100 percent,'' Johnson said. ''I don't think there's any question.'' An issue in dealing Revis will be whether the Jets would be able to get what they deem is fair value for him. Whether that means getting multiple draft picks, including at least a first-rounder, is uncertain, but Revis' injury situation might hinder that a bit. Still, CBSSports.com reported Friday that several teams are ''highly interested'' in trading for Revis. Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie told NFL.com Friday that the team ''can't lose a guy like (Revis).'' Cromartie stepped up, though, in Revis' absence and established himself as a No. 1-type cornerback - which could help soften the blow if the Jets deal Revis. ''He's a great leader in the locker room and also in our DB room, making sure that guys are accountable for each other,'' Cromartie told NFL.com. ''To lose a guy like that would be huge. And even though he's coming off the surgery, I believe he'll come back as strong as ever.'' Notes: Cromartie also weighed in on struggling QB Mark Sanchez, saying he wasn't the sole reason for the Jets' 6-10 season. ''We have confidence in Mark,'' Cromartie said from Hawaii after practice for the Pro Bowl. ''Like I've always said, even with the whole (Tim) Tebow thing, if we're going to sign Mark to a three-year extension, we need to make sure we put guys around him.'' Cromartie indicated that that wasn't the case for Sanchez, who was benched late in the season. ''When you don't have a supporting cast around him, you're going to get an average or below-average quarterback,'' Cromartie said. ''That's what we got.''",Raw Data
100,"NBA commissioner David Stern said Friday night that the counteroffer to keep the Sacramento Kings from moving to Seattle needs to be increased financially before the league's owners would even consider the bid. Speaking to reporters before the Golden State Warriors hosted the Houston Rockets, Stern said the Sacramento group's offer has some ''very strong financial people behind it but it is not quite there in terms of a comparison to the Seattle bid.'' He added that ''unless it increases, it doesn't get to the state of consideration.'' The league has scheduled a meeting April 3 in New York to avoid rushing debate on the issue. Representatives from Sacramento and Seattle will have a chance to present their case at that meeting, Stern said. The NBA Board of Governors will convene April 18, when a vote is expected to take place on the sale and relocation of the Kings franchise. A sale of a franchise requires a three-fourths majority approval of owners, while relocation requires just a simple majority. Stern said he is still hopeful that the Sacramento bid, led by 24 Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov and billionaire grocery tycoon Ron Burkle, will be comparable to the Seattle offer by the time owners have to make a decision. ''I think right now it is fair to say that the offers are not comparable,'' Stern said. Mastrov, among the final bidders for the Warriors before Joe Lacob and Peter Guber bought the team for an NBA-record $450 million in 2010, is hoping to become the majority owner of the Kings. Burkle, co-owner of the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins, is leading the effort to build a new downtown Sacramento arena that he hopes will also lure back a WNBA franchise. Mastrov was sitting courtside at the Rockets-Warriors game and said he wasn't surprised by Stern's comments. He said his group is still negotiating final terms with Sacramento and the NBA on a bid. Looking for the latest on the Kings? Get the inside slant, stats, scores, schedules and more scoops right here. ''It's all part of the process,'' said Mastrov, who will attend both meetings in New York. The commissioner lauded the work done by Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson to organize the counteroffer, calling the efforts ''Herculean.'' Johnson, a former All-Star point guard, has been trying to keep Sacramento's only major professional franchise from leaving California's capital city for more than two years. Last year, Johnson had a handshake deal for a new downtown arena with the Maloof family that owns the Kings. The owners backed out of the plan, which included a $255 million public subsidy, saying it didn't make financial sense for the franchise. Johnson's latest plan is to revitalize the city with an arena at the Downtown Plaza shopping mall owned by JMA Ventures, whose officers have said they are eager to participate. To show Sacramento support for the Kings, Johnson also has lined up at least 20 local investors who each committed $1 million. Despite all the mayor's efforts, Stern said the financial contribution from the Sacramento group is still lagging behind Seattle's bid. ''There's a substantial variance,'' Stern said. ''I have an expectation, a hope, that the variance will be eliminated by the time the owners give it consideration.'' Stern also said he has spoken with Kings minority owner John Kehriotis about a separate bid to keep the team in Sacramento. Kehriotis has floated the possibility of a mostly privately financed upgrade to the team's current suburban arena. POWER RANKINGS The NBA's best are battling for position. We rank all 30 teams. A Seattle group led by hedge-fund manager Chris Hansen and Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has had a signed agreement since January to acquire a 65 percent stake in the Kings for $341 million from the Maloof family. The group already has petitioned the league to relocate the team to Seattle for next season, restore the SuperSonics name and play in KeyArena for at least two years while a new downtown arena is constructed. Both the Seattle group and the Maloofs have been asked by the NBA not to comment on the issue. Hansen has been at the forefront of bringing the NBA back to the basketball-loving Pacific Northwest city. He reached agreement with local governments in Seattle last October on plans to build a $490 million NBA/NHL arena near the city's other stadiums, CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field. No construction will begin on that project until all environmental reviews are completed and a team has been secured. If the Seattle bid is blocked by NBA owners, the Maloofs would still have to agree to sell the team to any other group. However, Stern said the board has some influence on these matters and remains confident there will a resolution one way or another. ''If an ownership group has decided to exit our league,'' Stern said, ''it doesn't retain the ultimate right to tell us where it's going to be located.''",Raw Data
101,"﻿ Raiders general manager Reggie McKenzie said Tuesday night at the Senior Bowl that Pryor will have a chance to compete for the first-string job this summer in training camp. “He needs to see if he can take a game over in the preseason, make some plays and carry out a game plan,” McKenzie told me and co-host Jim Miller on Sirius XM NFL Radio. “Let him compete. That’s what it’s all about. If it looks like he can help us win, at the end of the day, that’s what it’s all about. That’s what we want.” Pryor didn’t win his starting debut last month in Week 17 against San Diego. But he did show marked improvement from the preseason during that 24-21 road loss. Although he completed only 13 of 28 passes for 150 yards with an interception, Pryor threw for two touchdowns and made plays with his legs. He rushed nine times for 49 yards while adding another score. “It was good to see him go in and implement a game plan,” McKenzie said. “He carried it out, played the game through and showed us what he can do. He definitely flashed some things that we’re going to try and see what we can do with him in the offseason.” Carson Palmer started Oakland’s first 15 games last season before being sidelined by a rib injury. The Raiders were 4-11 with Palmer under center. Three of those victories came against the teams that finished 2012 tied for the NFL’s worst record at 2-14 – Jacksonville and AFC West rival Kansas City. Check out the FOXiest fans from stadiums across the country and tweet us your photo. Not all of Oakland’s woes were his fault, but Palmer has failed to become the franchise quarterback the previous Raiders regime thought it was acquiring when sending first- and second-round picks to Cincinnati for his services midway through the 2011 season. The 33-year-old Palmer is a potential candidate for release because of his scheduled $13 million salary in 2013, but McKenzie didn’t indicate that such a move was in the offing. “It was unfortunate he had to end the season with an injury,” McKenzie said. “He’s rehabbing and making sure he gets those broken ribs together (to) bounce back so he can compete.” Pryor was one of the nation’s top college quarterbacks during three seasons at Ohio State. But his violation of NCAA rules for accepting payola along with several teammates led to Pryor entering the 2011 supplemental draft after the NFL’s regular draft was conducted. Pryor became a third-round pick but was forced to serve a five-game suspension for the “deliberate manipulation of (NFL Draft) eligibility rules.” The ban helped make Pryor’s rookie season a washout. Pryor’s accuracy struggles in the 2012 preseason pushed him into a reserve role behind Palmer and backup journeyman Matt Leinart, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason. Pryor, 23, must now impress a new offensive coordinator. The Raiders recently hired Greg Olson from Jacksonville to replace Greg Knapp, who was fired after his unit finished No. 26 in scoring average at 18.1 points per game. “That’s fine to be a great athlete,” McKenzie said of Pryor. “We’ve got a lot of great athletes who can run. I want them to be great football players. I want them to take their game plan and execute it. Just make plays.” Pryor’s future with the Raiders is far brighter than that of linebacker Rolando McClain. The underachieving No. 8 overall pick in the 2010 draft, McClain was suspended two games last season for insubordinate behavior. McClain was recently arrested again when allegedly cursing at a police officer following a traffic violation in his hometown of Decatur, Ala. Releasing him in the offseason wouldn’t cause the type of salary-cap hit that hindered the Raiders from making such a move in 2012 as McKenzie began the process of overhauling the roster. “I have not had any conversation with any of the authorities or Rolando for that matter,” McKenzie said. “Hopefully, this matter gets resolved on his behalf. “It’s unfortunate that these things kind of happen. I would think he would try and do whatever he can this offseason to make sure his career and personal life get on the right track.”",Raw Data
102,"Fernando Torres rediscovered his goal-scoring touch too late for Chelsea's Champions League hopes on Wednesday, with the English side becoming the first holders to exit at the group stage despite a 6-1 thrashing of FC Nordsjaelland. On a bittersweet night for Chelsea, Torres ended a month-long goal drought by scoring twice in a match for the first time this season, and manager Rafa Benitez claimed his first win in his fourth fixture. Chelsea went ahead in a frenzied spell in which both sides missed penalties before David Luiz scored from the spot in the 39th minute. Torres netted in first-half stoppage time. Although Joshua John pulled one back for Nordsjaelland 20 seconds after the break, Gary Cahill began Chelsea's second-half goal spree with a header. Torres drove in his second before Juan Mata and Oscar added further goals, but however stylish the performance, Chelsea will have to settle with a Europa League consolation place. The Blues finished third in Group E as Juventus' 1-0 victory at Shakhtar Donetsk ensured both sides advanced in the Champions League. The trophy Roman Abramovich had targeted since his 2003 takeover and won unexpectedly in May has now been surrendered like no team before it, and led to manager Roberto Di Matteo being fired last month. Chelsea's failure to progress owes much to Torres' inability to justify his $80 million-plus price tag with goals, with only one in Group E before Wednesday. Such is the Spain striker's decline, Benitez was left extolling the merits of his contribution in defense on the eve of the match. But Torres was at the heart of the powerful start by the energetic hosts, who were ripping through the Danish champions with ease. Torres had a shot pushed round the post by goalkeeper Jesper Hansen, and put the ball through to Mata who set up Eden Hazard but the resulting shot was easily saved. There was a let off for the visitors when Nicolai Stokholm turned the ball onto his own crossbar from Victor Moses' cross. The first penalty was awarded by referee Bas Nijhuis in the 31st after Cahill handled, but goalkeeper Petr Cech dived correctly to his right to save from captain Nicolai Stokholm. Almost immediately at the other end, Cahill's effort was then handled by Mikkel Beckmann. But Hazard was no better from the spot than Stokholm, as he struck low to the right and Hansen saved. Chelsea, though, got another chance when Mata struck into Joshua John's arms. This time, Luiz found the net on his return from suspension, sending Hansen the wrong way. Torres produced a morale-boosting goal in stoppage time after first clattering an effort against Hansen but then lifting the rebound into the net. Chelsea was sloppy at the start of the second half as John surged past Branislav Ivanovic and beat Cech. But Chelsea's two-goal cushion was restored after Torres won a free kick and Mata curled the ball in for Cahill to head powerfully into the net in the 51st. Torres' second came five minutes later, driving into the net after Hazard cut the ball back to him. Chelsea was now rampant and Mata played a one-two with Hazard before turning the ball into the net in the 63rd after his first effort was blocked by Hansen's legs. Gaps in the tiring visiting defense were exploited again as Oscar picked up possession and slotted in the sixth in the 71st.",Raw Data

104,"The most sickening part about watching Robert Griffin III crumple in a heap just outside his own end zone with 6:19 left in the Washington Redskins’ 24-14 wild card loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday wasn’t the way the rookie quarterback’s right knee contorted, gruesomely, in a way that knees most certainly are not designed to bend. Nor was it the chilling silence in the immediate aftermath from a FedEx Field crowd — one attending a home playoff game for the first time in 13 years — seeing the same thing you and I did and shuddering at the thought of what it might mean for their star player’s once-bright future, and, consequently, the outlook of their team. The most frustrating and maddening — and downright infuriating — aspect of the injury wasn’t that the fumble resulting from Griffin’s injury ended the Redskins’ already-slim chances at a comeback or that one of the league’s most enjoyable feel-good stories came to an abrupt end in the most disheartening way possible, either. No, the worst thing about the way Sunday’s game ended, both for the Redskins and Griffin, the No. 2 pick in April’s draft and a leading candidate for Offensive Rookie of the Year, was that all of it — the injury, the loss and the mindless babbling to explain it all away afterward — could have been prevented. None of it should have ever happened. If Redskins coach Mike Shanahan had any good sense about him, he’d have taken Griffin, who first sprained his right LCL on Dec. 9 against Baltimore, out of the game late in the first quarter, the moment he came limping back from the sideline after his knee buckled while planting to throw a pass. At worst, Shanahan should have stripped him of his helmet at the half, following a quarter of startling ineptitude with a visibly hobbled Griffin at the helm. But because a young player was too competitive to quit in his first playoff game and his veteran coach didn’t have the guts to make the tough decision for him, the Redskins will be watching from home as the Seahawks move on to face Atlanta, and one of the league’s most exciting players may never be the same again. The extent of Griffin’s injury won’t be known until later this week, but given the way the knee appeared to shred, and given Griffin’s history with his right ACL, which he tore in 2009 while still at Baylor, it’s hard not to fear the worst. And, unfortunately, it was something seemingly everyone but Shanahan and Griffin saw coming. “I think I did put myself at more risk by being out there,” Griffin said. “But every time you step on the football field in between those lines, you’re putting your life, your career (and) every single ligament in your body in jeopardy. That’s just the approach I had to take towards it. My teammates needed me out there, so I was out there for them.” As poorly as things ended for the Redskins, it’s easy to lose sight of how well things started. Washington easily scored on its first drive on a touchdown pass to running back Evan Royster, and followed it up with another unabated scoring drive on the next possession, which ended with a 4-yard toss to tight end Logan Paulsen. But it was a play two snaps before the Paulsen touchdown that should have been a watershed moment in the game that could have saved the Redskins’ season and Griffin’s knee. On first-and-goal from the Seattle 4-yard line, Griffin took the snap and rolled out to his right and eventually, after running out of real estate, threw an awkward, sidearm pass toward Pierre Garçon that fell harmlessly to the turf. After the play, Griffin returned to the field, and to say he did so gingerly would not do his condition justice. He looked like a wounded animal, to the point where he could hardly walk, much less run the read-option. After the touchdown pass, Griffin retreated to the locker room with Dr. James Andrews, a Washington team physician who, earlier Sunday, publicly expressed concern over Griffin playing, and got his knee taped. When he came back, Griffin was still something short of mobile, and sure as heck couldn’t move the way he did when he helped lead the Redskins to seven straight wins to close the regular season. But Shanahan looked an ineffective, and potentially already injured, quarterback in the face and told him to strap back up and get on the field anyway. “I talked to Robert and Robert said to me, ‘Coach, there’s a difference between injured and being hurt. I guarantee I’m hurting right now; give me a chance to win this football game because I guarantee I’m not injured,’” Shanahan said. “So that was enough for me.” From that moment on, Griffin, who moved the football effortlessly before that incomplete pass to Garçon, could do very little to combat a Seahawks defense that is already good enough without a gimpy quarterback’s help. After amassing 129 yards of offense, nine first downs and two touchdowns on their first two drives, the Redskins only managed 74 more yards of offense, six first downs and no points. The Seahawks outgained the Redskins 271-38 in the second and third quarters, alone. Some of that had to do with the Seattle defensive unit, which was among the best in the NFL this season and allowed a league low in points per game. But more of it, if not most of it, was a result of RG3 not being RG3. “That’s my guy,” Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman said of RG3 after the game. “He’s a hell of a player. He’s one of the best players I’ve ever seen. He presents a lot of challenges. I’m sure if he were 100 percent it would have been a different game.” Offensively, Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch carried the ball 20 times for 132 yards and a touchdown, and overcame an earlier goal line fumble with a tough 27-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to give the Seahawks the lead for the first time — and for good. And quarterback Russell Wilson, an Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate in his own right, threw for 187 yards and a touchdown and ran for another 67 yards, only serving to underline what Griffin couldn’t do. “You saw the difference between a healthy Russell Wilson and Robert not being healthy,” Redskins linebacker London Fletcher said. “I don’t know what percentage (Griffin) was at, but you could tell he just couldn’t do the things that he had done all season long to make those dynamic plays.” With that in mind, it made little sense to leave Griffin in, regardless of whether he was endangering himself physically by doing so. Backup quarterback Kirk Cousins has proven capable this season, especially in a win over Cleveland on Dec. 16 with Griffin on the mend, and 100 percent of him would have certainly been more effective against Seattle than 50 percent of the starter — maybe even effective enough to win. In the end, though, the most disconcerting part of Shanahan leaving Griffin in was the safety risk and lack of concern for his livelihood that it represented. Every game is full of players too hurt to play and too competitive to realize it, and it’s up to the coach to know when enough is enough. After the game, Griffin speculated that, had Shanahan pulled him, he would have run back out onto the field and continued to play anyway, and his equally blind teammates seemed to agree that the decision should have been left up to the player. “This is the playoffs, it’s a do-or-die situation,” Fletcher said. “Guys have a great deal of intestinal fortitude; never underestimate the heart of an athlete in a competitive situation. I think with Robert, he’s willed himself to be able to play, and he’s earned the right to be able to play if he tells coach he can play.” But it’s not up to the player. It can’t be. That’s why the dangers of concussions are such a hot-button issue today, and other injures should be treated with equal care. Leaving Griffin on the field, with a tattered knee and a precedent for knee injuries, was reprehensible, and if the news turns out to be as bad as it looked, Shanahan should be held accountable for what he did to Griffin’s future. There’s a fine line between being tough and being dumb, and RG3 crossed it while his team enabled him. After the game, Shanahan said he would have deserved to get fired had he not taken Griffin out of the game following the fourth quarter injury, but the real shame is that he didn’t take Griffin’s injury that seriously from the start.

105,"These WNBA Finals are not for the feeble. Seimone Augustus and the Minnesota Lynx toughened up after a rare loss and a soft performance at home in the opener by wearing down the Indiana Fever. Augustus scored 23 of her 27 points in the second half to help the Lynx surge past the Fever 83-71 on Wednesday night to even the best-of-five series at one game apiece. ''We're going all out. We don't want to look back on this situation and regret anything,'' Augustus said. Maya Moore pitched in 23 points and the defending champion Lynx forced the Fever into 24 turnovers, 15 after halftime. Tamika Catchings led the way as usual with 27 points and eight rebounds, but the Fever's defense faded after a dominant start that forced the Lynx to miss 11 of their first 14 shots. They let the Lynx score 29 points in the third quarter and bring an already-loud crowd into the game even more. Catchings offered an alternate theory, though. ''Seimone Augustus went against us. That's what happened,'' she said. The series now moves to Indiana. Game 3 is on Friday, and Catchings predicted an even more physical match. ''It was pretty rough out there, and we're going to have to adapt to that,'' said Fever coach Lin Dunn, who called this the most physical game she's seen in 42 years. ''We'll go home and we'll be ready.'' The Fever played without shooting guard Katie Douglas for the second straight game, the sprained left ankle she suffered at the end of the Eastern Conference finals still not ready for action. Then in the second quarter of this one, backup Jeanette Pohlen hurt her left knee and was taken to the locker room for further examination. She didn't return, and the lack of depth hurt the Fever down the stretch. Lynx reserve guard Monica Wright had five steals, and coach Cheryl Reeve said she changed the game with her defensive intensity. Inside, Rebekkah Brunson and Taj McWilliams-Franklin limited Erlana Larkins to three points on 1-for-6 shooting. She had 16 points and 15 rebounds in the opener. Dunn said she was disappointed in the effort. ''We just have to go back to Indy and regroup,'' Larkins said. The Lynx held a 24-3 edge in second-chance points and 17-2 advantage in offensive rebounds. But Augustus, named to the All-WNBA first team earlier in the day for the first time in her well-decorated career, was the primary difference maker. She swished a 3-pointer with about 6 minutes left to give the Lynx a 71-57 lead, their biggest to that point after the sluggish beginning. Augustus, who missed six of her eight shots in the first half, flashed a big smile toward her teammates as they retreated on defense. ''She has to have MVP-like performances in order for us to have a chance to be successful, and we saw that tonight,'' Reeve said. Even Reeve showed some muscle in this one. After Lindsay Whalen tied the game at 48 with a reverse layup, Moore picked up her third foul on the other end. Whalen's layup was blocked by Briann January when the Lynx got the ball back, and Reeve's game-long lobbying boiled over. Screaming for a whistle after her miss, Whalen was slapped with a technical foul by official Michael Price, who quickly tacked one on for Reeve. Then the coach really lost it, tearing her suit coat off and trying to escape assistant coach Jim Petersen's long arms as he held her back from further confronting the refs. ''We've got a lot of league people here. It's the WNBA Finals. So we have to be really, really careful in the things that we say. Clearly, I wasn't happy in that moment. I'm not happy about how the game was officiated, period, but that's all I'm going to say about it,'' Reeve said. Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, decked out in a black and green Lynx jacket, agreed with Reeve from across the court, dismissively waving his hand in disgust at the officiating crew. Catchings made both free throws to give the Fever a two-point lead, but the Lynx were fired up after that. Rebekkah Brunson soared for a rebound she tipped to Moore to retain possession. Moore pump faked then dribbled in for a layup that drew a foul and swished the free throw for a 57-55 lead. Augustus added a 3-pointer near the end of the period for good measure. ''I thought as a team we didn't step up to the plate when we needed to when we should've rallied and come closer together. It's like we came apart a little bit, and we can't afford to do that, not with the defending champ,'' Catchings said. Whalen had the look in her eyes that she wasn't going to let this one slip away, making a pull-up jumper early in the fourth quarter to stretch the lead to six and following that with a 3-pointer to put the Lynx up 66-57 with 7:21 left. ''It's the finals, so everyone is going at it aggressively,'' Whalen said. ''It's a lot of fun.''",Raw Data

108,"To many, Walker was a surprise choice for the PFA Young Player of the Year last season with the right-back pipping Sergio Aguero to the award. Walker's campaign ended in disappointment as Spurs missed out on a Champions League spot and a toe injury ruled him out of Euro 2012. Those setbacks may have played a part in the 22-year-old's performance level plummeting at the start of this season, as Walker committed several glaring errors - such as a costly mistake in the build-up to Chelsea's fourth goal at White Hart Lane - in Spurs' steady start under Andre Villas-Boas. The right-back's form has gradually stabilised, but it still seems as though his strengths lie in the physical side of his game, rather than decision-making and tactical intelligence. There is still plenty of room for improvement. Patrice Evra Evra is not the only defender to divide opinion at Old Trafford, but the left-back's form over the past two seasons has been more of a concern than the gradual progress of Jonny Evans and Rafael, who have both been impressive this year despite Manchester United's poor defensive record. Evra is also enjoying a good campaign after cutting out most of the errors that pockmarked his previous performances and United's vice-captain has also weighed in with four goals and four assists in his 22 appearances. The arrival of Alexander Buttner may have been the boost Evra needed (until he saw the Dutchman play, at least) and the 31-year-old seems to have restored the fans' faith with a string of influential displays. There has still been the occasional boob, but Evra typifies the intent of this United side to beat their opponents by relentless attacking rather than strict adherence to defensive duties. It suits him just fine. Chico Chico has certainly divided my own opinion since his 2million summer move to Swansea. The centre-back's reckless red card for a dangerous challenge on Louis Saha in September's draw with Sunderland suggested he could be an accident waiting to happen, but since then the 25-year-old has established himself as the Swans' most important defender. Chico's impressive form alongside Ashley Williams has helped Michael Laudrup's side climb to ninth in the Premier League and reach their first domestic cup final, as Chelsea became the first team not to score in a League Cup semi-final since Watford in 2005. Not only is Chico in the top ten for tackles, interceptions and clearances per game this season, he is also careful in his distribution and Laudrup will hope Little Boy Flowers continues to bloom. David Luiz Luiz could soon become a midfielder who divides opinion after being moved into the Makelele role by Rafa Benitez at the Club World Cup and the Brazil international has proved the perfect foil to Frank Lampard in his new position. But as Alex Hess says here, much of the criticism levelled at Luiz for his performances in defence has been unfair. The 25-year-old has eradicated most of the errors that caused Gary Neville to describe him as a PlayStation player last season, and he played a key role in Chelsea's Champions League triumph after returning from injury to face Bayern Munich in the final. His future at Chelsea (in terms of where he will play) depends largely on the interim manager's, but whatever happens to Benitez Chelsea have been rewarded for their patience with Luiz, who has now established himself as one of the most important players at the club. Laurent Koscielny In terms of ability, Koscielny is clearly a better defender than both Thomas Vermaelen and Per Mertesacker. But this season the France international seems to have regressed, with more errors than ever before and a string of unconvincing displays over the past few months. Koscielny's red card against Manchester City summed up his occasional brain fades, and Arsene Wenger should be worried that Edin Dzeko - who is hardly renowned for his movement - managed to get the wrong side of the defender so easily. Arsenal have conceded 17 goals in the 13 league matches Koscielny has started this season and while he is not the only blameworthy defender at the Emirates, the 27-year-old's form remains a concern. He will need to improve quickly if Arsenal are to stand a chance of securing fourth.",Raw Data

""As of now Vicioso is suspended from all competitions,"" a Katusha spokesman told Reuters. The 35-year-old is one of several world-class athletes being linked to Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes, who is currently on trial for allegedly masterminding a doping ring. ""He told us he had settled his case but it turned out that he didn't tell us the truth,"" Katusha general manager Vyacheslav Ekimov was quoted as saying by local outlet R-Sport. Vicioso was originally supposed to testify in person in court in Madrid last week. However, Spanish media reported that he sent a doctor's note saying he had back problems so the court rescheduled his testimony for this Friday. The Spaniard is due to appear by a video link from the town of Lleida in Catalonia. The judge said on Tuesday that Vicioso would be forced to appear if he did not do it on his own. Last week, Katusha won the right to compete on the elite World Tour this year following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December, cycling's world governing body UCI rejected their application to compete in the top flight because of the team's doping record over the past four years. ""We want to cooperate with the UCI in every possible way, therefore such actions by Vicioso just discredits our image,"" said Ekimov.",Raw Data

Perhaps the largest and oldest staple of the Super Bowl is the Chicken Wing. This great American past time and celebration of the majestic chicken wing has now been slaughtered and left behind, all thanks to two men. Dewayne Patterson and Renaldo Jackson are the two men who you can thank for higher wing prices and/or a shortage of the tasty chicken wing. These two stellar citizens used a rental truck to steal $65,000 worth of wings, one more time SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF CHICKEN WINGS. These two wing-nappers used a forklift to relocate 10 pallets worth of chicken wings into a rental truck in Lawrenceville, GA from a cold storage facility. For their attempt at becoming the Chicken Wing Czars they each were awarded Felony Theft charges and we were left with the loss of $65,000 worth of wings (the wings were sadly not recovered). It’s a pretty sad day that will change the way this country partakes in the Super Bowl festivities. Minus this great theft, wings have already seen an increase in price due to high demand and the cost of chicken feed rising. Now another blow to the wing fans wallets and appetites. Seriously though, what the hell happened to $65,000 worth of wings? Apparently smaller non-franchise wing restaurants are having to hunt around to find wings right now because of shortages and large franchises having secured amounts. So did these two steal all those wings for the chicken wing black market? I wonder if that is the new underground sensation. I certainly hope they didn’t eat all those wings. Man that is a lot of wings, I suggest using the pre-order technique to ensure a wing filled Super Bowl. Seriously, What The Fuck wing thieves?",Raw Data
111,"HANG TIME NEW JERSEY – Mike D’Antoni is right. The Lakers have been much better with only one of their two $19 million big men on the floor than with both of them together. That was D’Antoni’s explanation when he said before Monday’s game in Chicago that Pau Gasol would be coming off the bench until further notice. And the numbers back D’Antoni up, even after the Lakers lost to the Bulls by 12 in a game in which Gasol and Dwight Howard played just seven minutes together. Lakers efficiency with Gasol and/or Howard on the floor Offensively, with both Gasol and Howard on the floor, the Lakers have scored at a rate that would rank 12th in the league. With only one of the two on the floor, they’ve scored at a rate that would rank second. Defensively, with both Gasol and Howard in the game, the Lakers are defending at a rate that would rank 19th in the league. With only one of the two in the game, they’re defending at a rate that would rank ninth. Overall, with Gasol and Howard on the floor together, the Lakers have the point differential of a 37-win team. With only one of the two on the floor, they have a point differential of a 61-win team. The question, of course, is why the Lakers can’t play well with two of the best big men in the league on the floor together. And it’s hard not to point at the coach, because things were OK before D’Antoni took over. Lakers efficiency with Gasol and Howard on the floor together Five games apiece for Mike Brown and Bernie Bickerstaff are small sample sizes, but it’s clear that the Lakers’ early issues weren’t with their bigs. When they got off to a 1-4 start under Brown, the bench was more of a problem. The big man issues under D’Antoni are on both sides of the ball. Offensively, Gasol is a different player when he’s on the floor with Howard. In those 612 minutes, just 44 percent of his 208 shots have come from the paint. With Howard on the bench, 67 percent of Gasol’s 109 shots have come from the paint. D’Antoni’s system calls for three shooters around a point guard (who can also shoot) and a pick-and-roll big man. And Gasol can’t space the floor like a true stretch four. Here’s the thing: Gasol played 5 1/2 seasons with Andrew Bynum. And with Bynum on the floor, Gasol still took 66 percent of his shots from the paint, because Phil Jackson‘s offense allowed for two post players. The Lakers were a very good offensive team with the two bigs on the floor together. Defensively, the Lakers have breakdowns all over the place this season, mostly with guards Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant. But there’s no clear explanation why they’re much better with only one of the two bigs on the floor. It may be a foot speed issue, and they may just be able to recover better with a smaller, quicker player at the four. Under Jackson, they were better defensively with Lamar Odom at the four than with Bynum and Gasol out there together. Still, this is all kind of ridiculous. And it’s all too familiar. On the last team D’Antoni coached, he had two guys making about $40 million combined who couldn’t play well together either. Under D’Antoni, the New York Knicks were a minus-137 and absolutely awful defensively in 1,506 minutes with Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire on the floor together. The coach’s inability to get his two stars on the same page is a big reason he isn’t in New York anymore. Under Mike Woodson, the Knicks are even (plus-0) in 497 minutes with Anthony and Stoudemire on the floor together. The Lakers probably aren’t going to be making another coaching change. Instead, Gasol is probably on his way out the door. And we can only wonder what might have been had L.A. hired Jackson when they let go of Brown in November … or if they had just kept Brown.",Raw Data
112,"﻿MLS doesn’t need wishes to come true. Long gone are the days when its continued existence presented cause for concern. The league continues to grow in stature and improve in quality with each passing year. Most of its clubs fare well enough in their local markets and keep their accountants relatively satisfied. Many of its exports transition to stronger leagues and represent the league well when they do. But incremental progress doesn’t mean MLS couldn’t accelerate its growth – the question is how. This is a prudent league, and no firm answers exist to chart a course few leagues have even attempted. In their stead, aspirations and hopes fill the void. As the New Year beckons, here are a few ideas to help push the league toward its goals in 2013: Clinch a deal to place the 20th MLS team in New York City: New Yorkers haven't truly embraced the Metrostars or the Red Bulls for a litany of reasons too extensive to recount here. A new club gives MLS a fresh slate in the market; a soccer-specific stadium in Queens provides an opportunity to increase both franchise values and revenues with a hefty expansion fee. Any prospective investor/operator – and there are quite a few hopefuls in the queue, according to reports – must pay heed to the errors of the past. But a new New York team? On paper, it’s a winner. Devise stadium solutions for D.C. United and New England: Both teams desperately require new venues to bolster their prospects for the future. The problems differ: United has financial issues directly related to playing at the old and downtrodden RFK Stadium while the Revolution is unable to tap into the urban Boston market while playing games at the very suburban Gillette Stadium. But the answer is the same: get an intimate, soccer-specific venue located inside the urban core. If both teams can finally strike deals then the league would find itself with two markets capable of replicating the success found in the Pacific Northwest. Import more creative midfield figures: Most clubs struggle to find players capable of supplying the final pass on a consistent basis. The dearth of creativity prompts clubs to take surprising steps – New York's decision to sign ex-Lyon man Juninho Pernambucano in December, for example – in an attempt to rectify the concerns. It isn't easy to fix this particular problem in MLS’ price range (even with the Designated Player rule in place), but the arrival of a couple more playmakers to circumvent those robust defensive tactics would help the standard of the league significantly. Plot for a future with more squad investment: MLS clubs work within modest and somewhat pliable strictures to construct their squads. By and large, they do a decent job of identifying and procuring talent under those budgetary restrictions. Those measures temper expenditures, but they also inhibit the ability to compete on the open market for proven players capable of increasing the quality of play. The status quo can't persist through the next Collective Bargaining Agreement (set to expire in 2014) if the league wants to continue its growth on the world stage. This year should be spent trying to concoct new mechanisms to allow teams to import talent without abandoning the principles necessary to keep the league on solid financial footing. Watch domestic players play critical roles in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying: U.S. coach Jürgen Klinsmann turned to MLS standouts Alan Gordon and Eddie Johnson to help secure a berth in the Hexagonal. Klinsmann may not display similar faith during the final round given his preference for foreign-based players competing in better leagues, but the continued presence of a handful of domestic stars in the U.S. squad would bolster the league. If the Americans do not lean on local players in a prominent way, then the Hondurans and the Jamaicans will carry the mantle for the league; after all, they boast their MLS contingents.",Raw Data

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. Demetrious Johnson was staggered by the left fist of John Dodson, a blow that sent the UFC flyweight champ to the mat in the second round. Johnson popped right up like only a 125-pounder can and embarked on a rally that resulted in a victory by unanimous decision (48-47, 49-46, 48-47) to defend his crown at UFC on FOX 6, a bout at the United Center on Saturday night that followed a loss by Quinton “Rampage” Jackson in what is likely his last UFC fight. “I got dinged a little bit, but I’m in great shape,” Johnson said in his post-fight interview. “Those things are going to happen. You are going to get splashed. You are going to get hit.” Need the punch-by-punch details from UFC on FOX? We've got 'em right here. Dodson was the aggressor in the first two rounds, regularly catching Johnson with punches. Johnson, who earned the UFC’s first flyweight title in a five-round bout against Joseph Benavidez last year, proved to be better conditioned as the fight progressed. Johnson finished with a huge edge on takedowns and had the more devastating strikes in the later rounds, even if one was deemed illegal. Referee John McCarthy ruled — correctly as a replays showed — that Johnson delivered an illegal knee to Dodson's head while Dodson had a hand on the mat. That hand on the mat meant Dodson was on the ground and made the knee strike to the head, that bludgeoned Dodson's eye, illegal. “With your good eye, do I look ugly?” McCarthy joked. Dodson chuckled and replied in the affirmative. No points were deducted for the blow. Johnson caused more damage with about a minute left in the fifth round with a knee to the side of the Dodson’s face, which was already bloodied. Dodson's gas tank was seemingly empty as the champ closed out the victory. “I don’t think I won,"" said Dodson. ""Some people have said that (he did) - but I don’t think so. I think it was close, and there was one round in it so it was close. Just one round in it - but you got to win those one rounds. I will be back in the title picture soon. I got some things I need to go work on, I should have got out of that clinch better, but when I come back I will be better.” Johnson was pleased, yet magnanimous in his triumph. “It was a great fight, I’m very happy the fans liked it,"" said the UFC Flyweight champ. ""He hit me pretty good a couple of times, I was stunned but I am in great shape and my head cleared very quick. He’s very tough, very strong. I hit him with a lot of knees late on but he’s very tough. That was a great fight and great first defense.” In the co-main event, Jackson finished the final fight of his UFC contract on his back as Teixeira pounded away from the mount. Jackson, who appeared exhausted well before Teixeira’s sixth and final takedown, held out the final few seconds for the bell. Teixeira earned the unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 29-28) in the light heavyweight bout as his left hooks and takedowns were more than enough to impede the former champ. It was Teixeira’s 18th victory in a row and third consecutive in the UFC. Jackson waved to the fans as he exited after his third loss in a row. Jackson said before the fight he has no interest in re-signing — a feeling that could be mutual. “I’m happy to end on an exciting fight for them,"" Jackson said. ""I came into the UFC exciting and I left exciting.” Anthony Pettis is certainly one of the UFC’s flashier fighters and he did hop off the cage to knee Donald Cerrone. But it was a plain old kick to the liver that dropped Cerrone and led to his victory. Pettis followed with two punches before the stoppage that resulted in Cerrone’s first loss via a knockout in his 24 career pro fights. Pettis certainly inserted himself into the conversation as a potential challenger to lightweight titleholder Benson Henderson. (Pettis is the last fighter to beat Henderson.) The victory was also vindication for Pettis, who Cerrone accused of dodging him as Pettis dealt with shoulder injuries and a staph infection that kept him out of action the last 11 months. “He’s said I am scared of him,” Pettis said. “He’s talked nothing but (expletive) for a year while I’ve been out hurt with my shoulder. I had to sit there and listen to that for a year. And to wreck him in the first couple minutes like that was more important and better to me than winning on FOX, than getting closer to my title shot, than anything else."" “Shutting that guy up was the biggest thing for me. Now, I never need to hear about that guy again. He’s done, he’s got beat in one round. Goodbye.” Ricardo Lamas also raised his profile in the lightweight division with a victory to open the main card action on FOX. Lamas finally broke through Erik Koch’s takedown defense a minute and a half into the second round. Lamas dropped Koch with a kick and followed up with elbows and punches that resulted in a bloodied Koch and a stoppage midway through the round. “If I get on top, you better watch out,” Lamas said in his post-fight interview on FOX. “I’m not letting you up until you’re bloody or knocked out.” Koch remained on his back for a couple minutes after bout as he was patched up. He walked to the locker room without assistance. Canadian T.J. Grant unleashed some brutal elbows to stagger Matt Wiman, who was bloodied early in the lightweight fight that concluded the final fight on the undercard broadcast on FX. Grant finished Wiman with a flurry of blows before the fight was stopped with nine seconds left in the first round. “It turned out perfectly,” said Grant, who extended his winning streak to four. “My plan was to keep him up on his feet. As tough and durable as he’s been, I’m glad I Was able to hurt him and put him away.” Ryan Bader needed all of 50 seconds to overpower and submit Vladimir Matyushenko with a guillotine choke, the fastest submission since the light heavyweight division was created in 2001. It looked like Bader had the victory even quicker before Matyushenko wiggled free, at least momentarily. “This is my first sub since (“The Ultimate Fighter), but I work so hard on my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in the gym,” Bader said. “I’m happy to show it off in the Octagon.” Bader, who has already faced former champs Lyoto Machida, Rampage Jackson, Tito Ortiz and current champ Jon Jones, angled to fight another top name after the fight. “I’d love to fight another legend in Shogun Rua,” Bader said. “I think we’d have a great fight and to share the Octagon with him would be an honor.” Pascal Krauss easily earned the decision over Mike Stumpf (30-27 on all three cards) as their welterweight fight went the distance. It was only the second bout for Krauss since November 2010 due to a rash of injuries. “I felt very good in there,” Krauss said. “I haven’t managed to stay healthy. I’ve had three fights in the UFC, but I want three more this year. “ Clay Guida, a fan favorite just about anywhere, got the loudest ovation from his hometown crowd among all the fights of the FX undercard. Hatsu Hioki certainly didn’t have the fan support, but dueled Guida for three rounds in one of the closest bouts of the evening, a fight that Guida took via a majority decision (28-29, 30-27 , 29-28). “He was like a rubber band,” Guida said. “He was so hard to keep in one space so I could get anything going. For a tall guy, he hit me pretty good to the ribs in just the right spot a couple of times. But I think the takedowns won it for me.” In the first fight on the FX undercard, Rafael Natal battered Sean Spencer for a good portion of two-plus rounds. Natal eventually put an end to the middleweight bout when he got Spencer in an arm triangle that resulted in not only a submission but a broken arm. Shawn Jordan weathered the first-round fury by Mike Russow in their heavyweight fight, a fist barrage that somehow didn’t stumble Jordan. Jordan rebounded in the second and eventually had Russow in trouble on the mat before the fight was stopped at 3:44 earning Jordan the TKO win. And David Mitchell put on a strong display, taking a unanimous decision from Simeon Thoresen.",Raw Data
114,"Only Oprah Winfrey and her crew have heard the words directly from Lance Armstrong, but his interview this week could result in his sport being bounced from the Olympics, according to a report. News agency Reuters reported Tuesday that a member of the International Olympic Committee would consider dropping cycling from the Olympics if the sport's governing body were implicated in doping. In an interview with Reuters, IOC member Dick Pound said the drastic action could be considered if the International Cycling Union has acted improperly, particularly in covering up suspicious drug-test results. ""The only way it is going to clean up is if all these people say, 'Hey, we're no longer in the Olympics and that's where we want to be, so let's earn our way back into it,'"" Pound told Reuters. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles last year after a report by the US Anti-Doping Agency in October concluded he and his teammates cheated by using steroids, the blood booster EPO and blood transfusions. After years of denials, Armstrong reportedly admitted his transgressions to Winfrey in an interview on Monday at his home in Austin, Texas. That interview will air Thursday and Friday on Winfrey's cable network, OWN. The USADA report raised suspicion that the cycling union acted in concert with Armstrong to protect him from allegations of cheating. There have been media reports that Armstrong is considering testifying about his interaction with the ICU. That governing body on Tuesday called for Armstrong to testify to an independent committee formed in November in the wake of the USADA report. ""We would strongly urge Lance Armstrong to testify to the Independent Commission established to investigate the allegations made against the UCI in the recent USADA reasoned decision on Lance Armstrong and the United States Postal Service team,"" the federation said in a statement. It is that issue, rather than Armstrong's reported admission of cheating, that could lead to action from the IOC, Pound suggested. He is the former head of the World Anti-Doping Agency. ""The IOC would have to deal with it; the (UCI) is not known for its strong actions to anti-doping,"" Pound told Reuters. ""It was the same in weightlifting a few years ago. All of a sudden when you get right up against it, things go fuzzy and they say, 'Well, we can't punish innocent athletes in these sports by dropping the sport from the program.'""",Raw Data

The only thing all that unusual about the smattering of cheers that greeted Cassel’s glazed-eyed trip to the turf is that his hometown fans gave life to the noise. And for that, you can blame Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli, his boss, Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, and the escalating cost of being a sports fan in the era of shopping mall-amusement park stadiums. Sickening? A smattering of cheers for an injured $66 million quarterback with a rating of 66.2 and a league-leading 14 turnovers? No. No. What’s sickening is how easily Winston, Kansas City’s right tackle, deflected the national media from the real story. One of the most passionate fan bases in sports — Kansas City Chiefs fans — has been abused so thoroughly the last eight to 10 years that it is turning unruly. What happened Sunday inside Arrowhead Stadium is a result of the Hunt family’s neglect of their fan base. This has been brewing since 1998, since Marty Schottenheimer courageously and justifiably realized he should move on after 10 years in Kansas City. From 1989 to 1998, Schottenheimer and his front-office partner Carl Peterson transformed Arrowhead Stadium from an empty parking lot into one of the coolest, most electric places on earth eight fall Sundays a year. Football Sundays in Kansas City became mini-holidays. The whole town wore red starting on Fridays. Tailgating at Arrowhead Stadium before games was Kansas City’s No. 1 social activity. I’ve watched NFL games at every venue. Nothing compared to Arrowhead Stadium during the Schottenheimer era. Nothing. The Chiefs never advanced to the Super Bowl, but Kansas City was the NFL’s ground zero. The players, coaches and executives were treated like royalty. The players, coaches, executives and ownership got spoiled. They didn’t have to win it all to be treated as if they had. The Chiefs haven’t won a playoff game since 1993. That’s right. The Chiefs haven’t won a playoff game in two decades. But the stadium was filled, the parking lot packed and Chiefs jerseys hung in seemingly every Kansas City closet so Lamar Hunt, Kansas City’s Dallas-based owner, allowed Carl Peterson to hang around 10 years after Schottenheimer left, a good five years after it was painfully obvious Peterson’s previous success was a result of Schottenheimer’s brilliance. Most Chiefs fans concluded Hunt would’ve never allowed Peterson to linger for a decade if Hunt lived in Kansas City and felt the pain of each disappointing season as personally as Kansas City residents. Kansas Citians attached their identity to their professional football team. Joe Montana, Marcus Allen and Derrick Thomas made the typical, insecure Kansas Citian feel big time. NFL fans are a special breed, and they bring their own brand of craziness on game day. The stench of Peterson’s last 10 years and Lamar Hunt’s loyalty to Peterson are fueling Chiefs fans lack of patience with their successors, Scott Pioli and Clark Hunt. The situation is further exacerbated by KC’s newly renovated stadium and the elevated cost associated with it. Chiefs fans are paying $27 to park, $200 for a club-level seat, $10 for beer and are watching teams with no reasonable shot at postseason success. For the most part in today’s NFL, no quarterback equals no shot. Lamar Hunt and Carl Peterson could never pick a quarterback. In 20 years, they never drafted one in the first round. They preferred to sign someone else’s veteran. Given a choice in the 1990s between benching an aloof, inconsistent and expensive Elvis Grbac and going with locker-room/fan favorite Rich Gannon, Hunt and Peterson let Gannon escape to Oakland, where he won a league MVP award, made four Pro Bowls and one Super Bowl appearance. Grbac eventually bounced to Baltimore and quit football. No one, besides Trent Dilfer, remembers Elvis Grbac. Scott Pioli’s first major personnel decision in Kansas City was giving Matt Cassel a franchise-quarterback contract despite his highly suspicious resume. Cassel never played at USC. He played one season at New England. Cassel is Pioli’s original sin, the mistake that has haunted his four years in Kansas City. Pioli, the Bill Belichick disciple, saw in Cassel the second coming of Tom Brady. Pioli arrogantly and foolishly thought he’d discovered Brady in a bottle twice. Ha. This year Cassel has been the worst starting quarterback in football. He’s a turnover machine. He clearly lacks confidence. His arm strength is atrocious. His ball floats up before it moves ahead. He needs to be benched. Pioli won’t allow it. Injuries are a part of football, but these players have been hit particularly hard. Before Sunday’s game, a group of working-class Chiefs fans pooled their money to fly a banner over Arrowhead Stadium demanding that Hunt fire Pioli and bench Cassel. These people love their football team. Clark Hunt lives in Dallas. The fans are spending their money to get the attention of their absentee owner. They’re afraid that Pioli-Hunt is going to be a replica of Peterson-Hunt. Their fears are justified. Pioli is a poor man’s Peterson. Pioli is an embarrassingly insecure version of Peterson, a man with a bloated ego. Pioli masks his insecurity with a false bravado, a dictator’s management approach and a constant desire to manipulate the media into believing he was the brains behind the Patriots dynasty. Chiefs fans aren’t having it. They want a real quarterback. They want the Cassel charade to end. Pioli’s stubbornness forced a handful of Chiefs fans to spontaneously thank the Ravens for momentarily ending their Matt Cassel nightmare. I think America will survive. It’s easy for the national media to sit on their couches, inside their television studios or on their free, comfy press-box seats and preach polite decency to the working-class folks paying to watch their hijacked football team. I won’t do it. I was inside Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday as a Chiefs fan. I’m not the type to boo or cheer. But I want Pioli fired. Eric Winston, too.",Raw Data
118,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. The well-publicized relationship that star Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o had with a girlfriend who allegedly died was revealed as a hoax earlier this week. What is very, very real: The extra scrutiny Te’o will now be facing from interested NFL teams before April’s draft. Franchises already spend months sorting through player backgrounds trying to determine whether there are any warning signs that can affect where a prospect is selected. These range from legal issues to character flaws, and aren’t always known to the public like the tall tale surrounding Te'o. One general manager told FOXSports.com on Friday that he once repeatedly asked a player if he had ever run afoul of the law. The player repeatedly denied doing so unaware that the GM had photocopies of his mug shot — ""front and side,"" he said with a laugh — from a previous arrest. If the player was honest, there was still a chance of him being chosen. Instead, the general manager took his name off the team’s draft board. “I just knew he wasn’t the one,” the general manager said. How Te’o handles the questions coming from NFL clubs will determine whether he remains a first-round projection or slips into a later round, along with six to seven figures in guaranteed salary. “This is just like any other player potential off-field issue. You hear about this or that,” said the general manager, who still has Te’o ranked as a first-round pick. “We have a grade on him from the fall. You don’t all of a sudden change that or move him up or down your board until you get all the facts and research. That’s when you make your assessment.” Because he isn’t playing in any postseason college all-star games, the first chance Te’o has to meet individually with NFL teams will come in late February at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. He also will be expected to speak with the media and recount the saga that has made Te’o the talk of the country for painting the picture of a relationship with someone who didn’t exist in multiple media interviews during the college season. T’eo’s oft-repeated tale of losing his girlfriend to leukemia as well as his grandmother (which is true) in a short span of time this past fall made him a sympathetic and inspirational figure. It also may have helped fuel his bid to win individual accolades like the Heisman Trophy. In a statement released through Notre Dame, Te’o has claimed he was duped. Other family members have backed him. Te’o hasn’t made any other public statements after the initial expose by Deadspin.com. Numerous media outlets have since speculated about whether Te’o was intentionally perpetuating the girlfriend myth trying to gain attention for himself, or got caught escalating what he thought was a harmless story that ultimately spiraled out of control. “I think this immediately sends up red flags from a character aspect,” said Ted Sundquist, who was the Denver Broncos’ general manager from 2002 to 2007. “I’m not saying he’s a bad character. But any time you have something of this significance, it’s not just a little flashpoint.” Sundquist said it will fall upon teams to perform due diligence on their own to find out the truth about Te’o. Sundquist told FOXSports.com he is concerned that Te’o will probably have received coaching about answers to the topic from his representatives, which adds to the challenge of getting to the bottom of the Lennay Kekua controversy. “The opportunity you get for a one-on-one (interview) on your terms is probably going to come during a pre-draft visit,” Sundquist said of invitation-only sessions held at a team’s headquarters in late March and early April. “Sit down to talk to the kid. Let him give you the story and look you in the eye with his side of it without any other influences. And then you’ve got to follow up. That’s very important. “If I just go off what I’m seeing on television from the people at Notre Dame that know him, they feel this is not the Te’o they know.” Gil Brandt left no stone unturned during 29 seasons as a top figure in the Dallas Cowboys scouting department (1960-88). After meeting in person with a coaching staff about a player, Brandt would speak to others at the university, like the equipment manager, for what would be a less-politicized and often truer assessment. Brandt thinks NFL squads should use another resource when it comes to scouting Te’o — psychologists. “I don’t think (coaches and personnel departments) can decipher whether he’s a con guy and we’re being lied to or a guy who’s telling the truth,” Brandt told FOXSports.com. Brandt had Te’o ranked as the No. 19 overall prospect in his latest NFL.com mock draft. Until more is known about the fake-girlfriend situation and he conducts pre-draft workouts, Brandt believes T’eo’s draft stock is “kind of in a holding position.” Brandt said Te’o already was difficult to evaluate as a football player alone because of some inconsistent performances during his senior season. “If you throw tape of the Notre Dame-Oklahoma game on, it’s like he’s (playing at) 110 degrees,” Brandt said. “You throw tape of the Alabama (national championship) game on and it’s negative-20 degrees. I’ve never seen such a difference in a player as this guy right here.” Another general manager who spoke Friday with FOXSports.com believes Te’o is one of the best inside linebacker prospects entering the league in some time. He also said Te’o will remain a first-round pick unless “something really, really messed up” is revealed about the hoax. The GM, though, is curious to see how Te’o handles explaining what has transpired. “Part of me wants the kid to come out, be a man and say, ‘Hey, it ended up being a hoax. I’m a linebacker. At my core I’m a meathead ball-buster. I got carried away and I apologize,’ ” the general manager said. “Maybe that would be simplifying it, but instead so far he’s trying to come across as naïve. That’s a little funky in itself. “You’ve got to look through all this and make a judgment. If it’s a lying and major fabrication issue, you need to determine the depth and duplicity of it. In light of what’s going on with Lance Armstrong, we all know the best way to do this.” That’s tell the truth before it destroys your reputation, career and legacy, which is something Te’o can accomplish that Armstrong didn’t.",Raw Data
119,"If youre a Pistons fan old enough to remember the great Bad Boys and their two NBA championships, or if youre a little younger and only remember the Goin to Work Pistons who won the title in 2004, then its probably tough to not be disappointed when the team starts out 3-11, which is where the Pistons are so far this season. But you dont have to look too far or too hard to be excited about the future when you have a young player like Greg Monroe showing the truly remarkable progress hes made so far, not only from the start to the end of his rookie season but from last season to this one, as well. Greg is right now, in my opinion, already a standout and bordering on a young star. Hes made such amazing strides, it seems like every week, every month, but if you really look at it, its almost every game. There was a blip on the radar against the Rockets in Houston, but they have great size and they see the scouting reports. They did their best to contain him and reduce his touches and his shots. It did make a great difference, but we will certainly find a way to get him as many touches and shots as he needs. I know that, and when he gets them, hes going to be as productive as any young big man in the league. When I really think about it, Im not sure I can remember anyone who stepped it up that much between year one and year two like Greg has. Ive been around quite a while, so I guess thats saying something. Whats happened with Greg, I believe, is that hes like a sponge. This is a very bright guy who has great basketball instincts, but beyond that his basketball IQ is right up there. Hell learn more about how to get things done in this league and be better in March than he is now in January and I think we can expect even bigger and better things from him next year. You dont want to put too much pressure on him, of course. He understands how important he is to this team because he has that kind of understanding of his role and of this game. He will continue to make progress. I think last year he might have started slowly, but he took advantage of every time he got a chance to touch the basketball, every time he had minutes on the floor. The Pistons did not go to him or go through him last year certainly not early in the season. In fact, his minutes were scarce early. Later on, he found out how to get to the basketball and make things happen on put-backs and other ways and began to get more touches as the season wore on. This year, weve made a concerted effort to get him the basketball and its paid huge dividends. As my partner, Gregory Kelser calls him, hes the go-through guy, but I also think hes a go-to guy. Greg is absolutely correct, but he is also our go-to guy, which makes him a standout already and soon to be a star. The Pistons have had some great big men, players with truly unique skills over the years. I see a little bit of Bob Lanier in Greg Monroe. He doesnt quite have Bobs great size and I dont think theres ever been a big man who has had the same touch as the Dobber had. If he doesnt have quite the same touch, that doesnt mean he doesnt have a nice touch. Bob Lanier was a great passer and, frankly, so is Greg. I think if you called Greg Monroe a good passer or a very good passer, you might be shortchanging him. Weve seen some great passes from Greg Monroe on the court and well see more. Hes the closest thing to Bob Lanier that weve had since the great Hall of Famer played center in the Motor City. The fact Greg played two years in college was an intelligent move on his part. You can really learn and polish your game in college, especially if youre playing for a top-notch program like Georgetown against great competition. I think John Thompson III is a heck of a coach and it was probably good for Greg to be there two years. He was ready to play in the NBA. He was no longer a project when he got here. Watching his progress has been a joy over the last year and change. I cant wait to see where Greg Monroe can help take the Pistons over the coming seasons.",Raw Data

Yes, these were brains, not lower guts, on display Tuesday by former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue as he “vacated all player discipline” imposed by current NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Saints players involved in Bountygate. In other words, Tags handled the messy task of walking back Roger God-ell and his dictatorial take on commissioner-ing, most clearly displayed by his overreach and over-punishment without sufficient evidence, without due process and without a clear path of appeal. What this was not was a rebuke of Rog, as has been widely described. Tags saved him. Actually, he saved The League, protected The Shield, as they are so fond of saying in NFL circles, by insulating the league from a Jonathan Vilma defamation lawsuit. Brian McCarthy, @NFLprguy on Twitter, actually delivered the most honest summary of what happened Tuesday when he tweeted: “Tagliabue says he wanted to resolve matter completely so NFL and NFLPA can move on to address player safety issues.” Translation: The NFL is about to be hip-to-waders deep in lawsuits about concussions and the overall safety of the game to be fighting a couple of players — in court, with the power of discovery — on whether they intentionally hurt a couple of other players. Rog had gone one bridge too far with the bounty scandal. For whatever reason, he let this get personal with Vilma. The league’s handling of the scandal was bleeped from the beginning, long before Vilma fought back. The investigation was not really an investigation at all. The penalties that followed were crazy harsh, certainly when factoring in what little they had in the way of evidence as opposed to hearsay and quantum leaps. The appeals process was a joke, with Roger basically upholding himself. And when Vilma took them to court and basically got a temporary restraining order to get the players back on the field, it was on. Roger went apoplectic about a player challenging him, because nobody ever really fights back. This was how Roger found himself backed into a corner that Tags saved him from Tuesday. What Tags did was give him political cover to maneuver. Roger now can say that the players did this awful thing, the league is just concerned about safety and the players got their day in court, which is exactly what the league did say in a really long, self-congratulatory statement. The best parts were the lines about how Tags' decision “underscores the due process afforded to player in NFL disciplinary matters” and how Tags basically agreed with Roger on everything. Well, everything except for: • Scott Fujita’s involvement. Tags totally exonerated him. • The severity of the punishment. Tags said it was too much. • Whether there was definitive proof, whether the process was clean and whether these four players were basically denied a year of their playing careers. Saints quarterback Drew Brees was right when he tweeted Tuesday: “Unfortunately, there are some things that can never been taken back.” So, basically, what Tags did was agree there was a bounty program and some fines were probably in order. It is wrong, though, to say Goodell lost Tuesday. He already had lost. Tuesday just gave him an exit strategy. About the only real loser is former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who’s still suspended indefinitely. Tags said to blame the coaches, and Williams was the only one on tape screaming “kill the head.” So he gets to be scapegoated for whatever did or did not happen while the league gets to cite Bountygate as a shining example of its ongoing concern for player safety. The message is probably being spread through league-approved channels right now that really, deep down, the bounty scandal was about trying to step in and protect players from themselves. It is all part of the bigger message the league is trying to sell: The game is not dangerous in and of itself. The problems are the bounties and rogue coaches and kickoffs. What interesting timing, huh? Talk of abolishing kickoffs just happening to surface as the league grapples with one Cowboys player dead, another charged with intoxication manslaughter in his death and real questions about what, if any, role concussions played in a murder-suicide involving a Chiefs player. These are just the past two weeks. There is still an army of former players lawyering up and ready to testify that football left their bodies broken and their brains scrambled. The fight now is about what the NFL knew and when it knew. There are fights about insurance coverage and payments and plausible deniability and personal responsibility and whether the game was worth it. The very survival of the league is about to go on trial publicly, and Goodell was in a pissing match with Vilma. So Tags did not rebuke him. He saved him. It would not surprise me at all if this was their plan, if Roger signed off on it. I am not saying they conspired, merely that it would not surprise me. Tags and Roger, at their very core, believe in the first rule of NFL Commissioner Club: Don’t endanger The Shield. It was just a happy coincidence that in doing so, the right thing was done for those Saints players.",Raw Data
122,"There is always risk involved when you’re a team maybe good enough to win the NBA title and you make a deal at the trade deadline in February, just a few short months before the playoffs begin. The Rasheed Wallace trade the Pistons made in 2004 probably wasn’t a very risky move – but it took an incredible amount of work and persuading on Joe Dumars’ behalf to get it done. But the 1989 trade that sent Adrian Dantley to Dallas for Mark Aguirre – that was a risky move. If the Pistons would have hung on in the face of that late call in Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals and Isiah’s ankle and all of that to beat the Lakers, Adrian Dantley would have been the MVP of the Finals. We’re talking about an NBA Hall of Famer, and yet Mark Aguirre was a great scorer and one of the game’s elite small forwards, just as Adrian was. I really believe that trade was as much about Dennis Rodman as it was about Adrian Dantley and Mark Aguirre. Adrian Dantley had the ultimate crunch-time mental toughness on his side. He wanted to be in the game at the end and felt like if he was fouled, he could go to the free-throw line and win it. That’s what he worked all his life to do. And Chuck Daly, when he realized what he had in Dennis Rodman – who I think is a future Hall of Famer and, in fact, is on the ballot this year – wanted him to be a finisher because of his great defense. So he had a problem on his hands. No question, AD didn’t want to come out of games and you can’t blame him. He was a winner and a guy who could win the game for you down the stretch. Then you had Dennis Rodman, who could defend all five positions. If your main goal was to shut down the other guy’s small forward – and that was an era where there great small forwards, especially players like Larry Bird and Dominique Wilkins and Larry Nance and Scottie Pippen in the East, and of course in the West the Pistons had to have somebody who could guard James Worthy if they were going to win it all – and make somebody else beat you, you put Dennis Rodman in the game. It seemed like a situation where Mark Aguirre might be better suited to that role of sitting out down the stretch. I think that was why the trade was made as much as anything else. If you look at Jack McCloskey’s record, he wasn’t afraid to trade small forwards. He traded Greg Kelser for Vinnie Johnson, then traded Kelly Tripucka for AD and AD for Mark Aguirre. And I think you could have probably won the championship with any one of them. Gregory eventually injured his knee, but at the beginning he had tremendous ability and potential. We all know Kelly Tripucka was a guy who once averaged 25 a game in this league. And AD – what can you say about AD, except that he was a pro’s pro and a great, great scorer. And Mark Aguirre did win a championship in combination with Dennis Rodman. So it all worked out for the Pistons, though I’m sure there is certainly disappointment and always will be for Kelly Tripucka and Adrian Dantley. Then there’s the Rasheed deal. Rasheed had his naysayers – among people who really didn’t know anything about him except that the media perhaps didn’t like him. But I had a connection in Portland with Harry Hutt, who had been an executive with the Pistons, and I had heard nothing but good things about Rasheed from his teammates and Harry. When I heard that Joe D had pulled off that trade for Rasheed, I felt like if you get a player with that kind of ability who is a great teammate, you might have just punched your ticket to a championship. Yes, the Pistons won a title without a superstar, but they had guys with superstar ability and Rasheed was certainly right there at the top of that list. Good for Joe for making that deal. When you’ve won a title or two yourself, as Joe did, I think you have a feel for what it might take to finish off a world championship team. Certainly, Rasheed was a perfect piece to fit in that puzzle. I think he was the kind of guy Detroit fans grew to love. He was really one of us and that made it an even better idea. I don’t think the numbers tell the story when it comes to Rasheed Wallace – they never have. He had some great years statistically in Portland, but his numbers could have been better. Some say, then why weren’t they? What I say is what really mattered to Rasheed – back to his days at Simon Gratz High in Philly – was winning basketball games. That’s what mattered to him at North Carolina and certainly what mattered to him as a pro. I thought he could have been, in the twilight of his career, the guy who put the Boston Celtics over the top. And I believe if Kendrick Perkins hadn’t gone down in Game 6, the Celtics would have won and Rasheed would have two championships. That’s what really mattered to Rasheed. His teammates felt better when he was on the floor. They felt better even when he was just sitting on the bench. Just to have Rasheed Wallace there made a difference. There’s a certain swagger, a certain basketball IQ, a certain winning spirit that comes with Rasheed being on your team. Anybody who won a title with the Pistons in 2004 would tell you the exact same thing. There’s a school of thought that says if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. The Pistons weren’t broken teams in either 1989 or 2004 but they had general managers who went for it to try to make their teams just a little bit better. If you feel you’re within reach of a championship, go ahead and do it. It worked out beautifully for the Pistons with Rasheed Wallace in 2004. It worked in 1989, too, and I understand the thinking behind it, but I also feel the Pistons could have won it all with Adrian Dantley – but they did win it all with Mark Aguirre and that’s the bottom line.",Raw Data
123,"In retrospect, while the so-called Car of Tomorrow helped NASCAR achieve a variety of goals in terms of safety and other initiatives, NASCAR officials now concede that perhaps it also negatively impacted other aspects of the racing. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France said Tuesday that the car did move the sport further from the manufacturers that compete in the sport. While that was not the plan when the car debuted, now that the stock-looking Generation 6 car is drawing raves, its easy to see just how much fans missed the tie between the cars they drive and the ones their favorites race. Looking back, you're always 100 percent accurate when you get to look backwards, right, and I think that would be fair, that we certainly didn't intend to do that, intended to try to make racing better and costs were a huge thing, as they still are today. ... We did significantly bring costs down and safety was a big thing as it is now, France said when asked about the shift away from manufacturer identity with the car that debuted in 2007. We significantly improved that. But it would be fair to say that in doing those things, we weren't as in step as we are today with the manufacturers. It would be easy to sweep the previous Sprint Cup car model under the rug now and point to the things about it that were viewed as less favorable than some aspects of the new model. However, it would be rash to dismiss the model entirely. France can point out things that were learned with each of the models and aspects of each that benefited the series at a specific time. CHECK IT OUT Chevrolet has officially unveiled its 2013 Sprint Cup model. We love the new car, the Gen 6 car, and we have said that we made some errors in really in collaboration to getting the (old) car, he said. We achieved a lot of things with that car: Costs, as I said; safety went up; a lot of benefits that the industry and that the teams and drivers gained from that car. Obviously we got away from some things that historically had worked well for us: The manufacturer rivalry, which we're excited about; the relevance issue with the car manufacturers. And then I think we put a lot more focus in the new car into the rules package surrounding the car that we didn't put nearly I can tell you we didn't put nearly as much science into the old car as we tried to achieve better racing. No sense in worrying about what happened in the past; we're excited about the future. NASCAR president Mike Helton agreed. We shouldnt stick a dagger in the Gen 5 program and say, Man, we're glad you're gone, because that era, that Gen 5 created a lot of great moments for NASCAR. The last two championships for one, a lot of races in its stable or its time in existence,"" Helton said. MOVING FORWARD Check out the 2013 Sprint Cup Toyota Camry. It also led to the evolution of the collaborativeness that we now operate the sport by when it comes to the parts and pieces and the cars themselves. It also served very well in an era when the car manufacturers involved in our sport were struggling with their own businesses, and we weren't a front-burner topic to them. We had a car that could survive that era. So there (are) a lot of positives to the Gen 5 era that we shouldn't overlook as we celebrate the Gen 6. So while he is pleased with the enthusiasm that is ushering in the new model, he cautions that one should remember it was the latest step in an evolution of models. It should also be noted that the benefits of the new Gen 6 car go beyond just the manufacture imprint each carries, though that has received the most attention. France sees the Gen 6 model as having an impact beyond that and even beyond the 2013 models. France says it shows how much closer the manufacturers and NASCAR are working now than they did in recent years. There (are) other things that are now much more important to each of the car manufacturers that maybe wasn't as important 10 years ago, things like innovation, he said. We've talked about a glass dashboard. That's coming. We'll balance, again, against costs and what they want. But that's things that are going to be they're using a lot of technology to obtain those goals and reach their goals, and they want to use the NASCAR relationship and the platform to help develop some of those, and we're going to be a very willing and good partner in doing just that.",Raw Data

He came back and he really didn’t run that strong, but you almost wonder if that was still a little bit of a hangover from being gone two weeks. But still that was a little bit of a surprise. We've all talked about Clint, but I would have to say Michael Waltrip Racing across the board was a surprise as well, having two teams make the Chase. I know that Martin Truex Jr. never won a race — a bit of a disappointment for them because Truex was the only driver in the Chase that didn’t win a race. But still, to get two guys in the Chase for the first time in the history of that organization was great, and then the way the No. 55 third team performed with three different drivers deserves notice as well. That’s almost an impossible task, what they took on there with multiple drivers sharing the car week to week, but they made it work. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen anybody make that work. I guess just that whole organization, across the board, was a bright spot for the sport. I would also say Kasey Kahne. I don’t think it came as a surprise to see him run well in his first year at Hendrick, but he really gained ground. It was a brilliant move bringing crew chief Kenny Francis with him. Those guys won a couple of races and stayed in the thick of the hunt pretty much the whole Chase. A little inconsistent, which is something they’ve got to work on, but they did finish fourth in the points. I’d say one of the disappointments would be Richard Childress Racing. I know Kevin Harvick made a crew chief change, I know Kevin won a race, but just across the board that organization’s got a lot of work to do. They know it. They truly know it. I hate to say I agree with Jimmy Spencer. I never thought I’d say that, but he said on SPEED's ""NASCAR Race Hub"" that RCR needs a serious revamping and maybe even housecleaning. They’ve got a lot of work to do. I’d say Earnhardt Ganassi Racing, too. There is probably not another organization in our sport that was gladder to see the 2012 season end. Neither Jamie McMurray nor Juan Pablo Montoya even had a top-five finish in 2012. I would have to say that was a huge disappointment. The other one I’m hesitant to say was a disappointment, but when you look at Kyle Busch and the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing team — to know that Kyle Busch alone, running the top three series, it was not unusual for us over the past several years to talk about him winning double-digit races combined in all three series. We know he cut his schedule back in the Camping World Truck and Nationwide series, but whoever would have believed — I know you would have gotten every dime I’ve got because I would have been hesitant to bet — that Kyle Busch has one win in NASCAR in 2012 and that was at Richmond in the spring. The bright spot? I’m not sure anybody ran as consistently as he did in the Chase. That’s a head-scratcher because if you look at the years that Kyle made the Chase, the Achilles' heel has been the Chase, as he fell on his face before the Chase even got started good. Go along for the ride as Brad Keselowski celebrates being champ. This year, outside of the engine issues at Loudon and the wreck with Ryan Newman at Kansas, if he’d been in the Chase, he would have been up there competing with Brad Keselowski, Jimmie Johnson and Clint Bowyer for the championship. But it’s a disappointment that he didn’t make the Chase and that he only won one race. Another disappointment is knowing how strong Tony Stewart ended the season last year in winning the championship and to come back and all of his bright spots were in the first half of this season. The last race he won was Daytona back in July, and he only had four top-five finishes after that. Then, of course, there's Carl Edwards. I look at that whole deal and I just absolutely scratch my head and go, “What in the world?” How can you go from 19 top-five finishes one year to only three this season and not even come close to winning a race. Most of the season, we were talking about Carl Edwards being in position to get the free pass and get back on the lead lap. Adding Jimmy Fennig as crew chief for 2013 is a good move for Carl. I know team owner Jack Roush had to do something. Right now that’s kind of his signature team. I was disappointed because I felt like Jimmy Fennig was going to be the perfect crew chief for Ricky Stenhouse Jr. in his rookie season in Sprint Cup. It’s almost like they need two Jimmy Fennigs over there. Scott Graves will be fine for Ricky Stenhouse Jr. I know they worked together on the few Cup races that Ricky did run, but I felt like Jimmy was going to be the perfect scenario for Ricky Stenhouse Jr. Off track — I can’t say they were surprises — but Matt Kenseth leaving Roush Fenway after 13 years, winning a championship, winning two Daytona 500s — he had a lot of success with that team. He was not the guy who was going to go out and generally win six, seven races a year but certainly the guy that you knew was going to be there in the thick of the Chase year after year. He made the Chase all but one year. But I think it was time for Matt to move on. For some reason — and this has to affect a driver; I’m sure it effects his salary negotiations — ever since DeWalt left a few years ago, the team has struggled to find sponsors for Matt and the No. 17. That has to take a toll on a driver. Now he’s going to an organization, for whatever reason, that seemingly has no problem putting sponsors on the car and that’s Joe Gibbs Racing.",Raw Data
125,"﻿A source with knowledge of Bill O’Brien’s contract tells FOXSports.com that the buyout amount is closer to $19 million than the $9.2 million widely reported. The Penn State football coach is believed to be on several NFL teams’ head-coaching wish lists after leading a depleted, demoralized and NCAA-sanctioned Nittany Lions team to an 8-4 record just one year after the Jerry Sandusky scandal upended the program and university. O’Brien’s contract stipulates that if he terminates his contract with the university the damages would equal his base salary and an additional $1.35 million annually, multiplied by the years remaining on the contract. The source said those punitive measure apply to O’Brien’s entire, new nine-year contract that was extended from five years after the NCAA sanctions. That would put the amount at $18.4-million rather than $9.2 million. O’Brien makes only $2.3 million a year, meaning his buyout is highly disproportionate to his yearly pay despite the fact he should have had more leverage in his negotiations earlier this year when he became Penn State’s head coach.",Raw Data
126,"One of the oldest trick plays in baseball is now a balk. Under a rule change imposed by Major League Baseball, pitchers will no longer be allowed to fake a pickoff to third base and throw to first as a way to dupe a runner on first base into breaking for second. Next season, that move would be a balk. Pitchers can still step off the rubber and fake to third. The change was approved at the owners' meetings two weeks ago. The Associated Press first reported the pending rule change last May after the Playing Rules Committee approved the proposal with MLB executives and umpires in agreement. The players' union, though, vetoed the plan. The collective bargaining agreement allowed MLB to implement the change after a one-year wait.",Raw Data
127,"Sporting Lisbon bowed out of the Europa League on a high with a 2-1 win marking their first victory of the campaign in their delayed dead-rubber final Group G encounter with Videoton. The match, postponed by 24 hours due to a waterlogged pitch at the Stadio Jose Alvalade, looked set to be settled in the hosts' favour by Zakaria Labyad's 64th-minute strike, but there was late drama with two goals and a red card in the final 11 minutes. Gyorgy Sandor equalized for Paulo Sousa's Videoton with an 80th-minute penalty, only for Valentin Viola to swiftly head the Portuguese side to a 2-1 win. Sandor was then dismissed for a foul on Diego Capel, which ended the Spanish winger's involvement in the game, and there was no way back for the visitors. Sporting headed into the clash already certain of finishing bottom of the pool after taking just two points from their first five games, while third-placed Videoton's hopes of becoming the first Hungarian club to qualify from the group stages of a major UEFA competition were extinguished when Genk and Basle drew 0-0 last night. Sporting's Marcelo Boeck was much the busier of the two goalkeepers in the first half, parrying Filipe Oliveira's right-footed blast in the 17th minute and keeping out Nermanja Nikolic's close-range effort with his feet soon after. Boeck was powerless in the 24th minute, though, when Renato Neto lashed a shot from the edge of the box against the bar. Despite having been on the back foot for much of the first period, Sporting had a fine chance to open the scoring 10 minutes before the break but Viola directed his header wide from Labyad's free-kick. Franky Vercauteren's side continued to look more positive after the interval, however, and they received their reward in the 64th minute, when Labyad was on hand to despatch the rebound into the top-right corner after Videoton goalkeeper Tomas Tujvel had parried a fierce drive from Emiliano Insua. Labyad could have grabbed a second goal eight minutes later but was denied by the feet of Tujvel. The save looked to have proved crucial soon afterwards when Sporting midfielder Fito Rinaudo handled the ball inside his area and Sandor made no mistake from the spot. But Sporting were back on level terms for only three minutes before Viola's header made it 2-1 following a goalmouth scramble, and the visitors' hopes of getting back into the game suffered a setback a minute later when Sandor saw red for a bad foul on Capel.",Raw Data
128,"Berger headed into the third and final event in Norway, the 12.5km mass start, having been so dominant on the way to wins in the 7.5km sprint and 10km pursuit. And it appeared as if Berger, who medalled in every event she entered at the World Championships, winning four golds, would be cruising to a third straight victory in Oslo. She took the lead for the first time after shooting clear in her first trip to the range and, despite briefly falling behind Darya Domracheva, she had a 20-second lead at the fourth and final shoot. Berger had gone clear up until that point however she missed two targets to surrender the lead to Anastasiya Kuzmina and face a battle on her hands to win again in Oslo. However Kuzmina couldn't keep Berger at bay as she recovered from her poor shoot to beat the Slovakian by 5.4 seconds with her final winning time 36:58.8minutes. Domracheva completed the top three 23.3seconds behind the Norwegian in total and 4.1 ahead of France's Anais Bescond, who shot completely clear, in fourth. And, with just five races left this season, Berger now cannot be caught at the top of the overall World Cup standings with her lead over Domracheva 321 points.",Raw Data
129,"– The Pistons took a 5-18 road record with them to Milwaukee, where they recorded what was likely their best win away from The Palace this season last month when they beat the Bucks 103-87. They’ll probably remember Saturday night’s 105-100 win even more fondly. Charlie Villanueva starred off the bench with 18 points and 13 rebounds, including a key defensive rebound with just over 30 seconds left and then the game-winning triple with the shot clock winding down inside of 10 seconds. Jose Calderon’s driving layup tied the game at 100 to set up Villanueva’s heroics. Calderon, playing in his fourth game, led the Pistons with 23 points, 10 assists, five rebounds and three steals. BLUE COLLAR – One night after logging 40 minutes while putting up 26 points and 16 rebounds, Greg Monroe still had enough gas in the tank to record his 23rd double-double of the season. Monroe had 14 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and four steals as he battled inside with the Pistons shorthanded in the frontcourt now that rookie Andre Drummond is out for the next four to six weeks with a back injury. RED FLAG – The Pistons forced eight Milwaukee turnovers in the first quarter and it led to one of their most efficient offensive quarters of the season as they scored 33 points and shot 60 percent while committing just three turnovers of their own. From that point on, the Bucks took much better care of the basketball than Detroit. The Pistons coughed it up seven times in the third quarter and wound up committing six more turnovers than the Bucks with 20 for the game. One reason the Milwaukee Bucks felt comfortable enough to make Charlie Villanueva a free agent four years ago was the fact they had Ersan Ilyasova – a player they knew could provide many of the things that made Villanueva so effective for them – waiting in the wings. Those two players were in the same frame of the picture that defined Saturday’s game: Charlie V taking a twisting pass from Will Bynum, allowing Ilyasova to fly past him on a harried closeout, calmly gathering himself as the shot clock hit 2 seconds before letting a 3-point shot fly from the top of the arc. There were 10 seconds left in the game and the score was tied at 100. Rodney Stuckey raised his arms to the roof even as Villanueva released the shot, which ruffled the nets at the far end of the court from the erupting Detroit bench. Brandon Jennings heaved a wild 3-pointer from 40 feet, attempting to draw a foul, and the Pistons clinched it with two Rodney Stuckey free throws. “It feels great,” Villanueva said after the 105-100 win. “I don’t even know who passed me the ball, but once it hit my hands I knew it was in. It was a big game, especially here in Milwaukee, where I called it home once.” Playing their second game without Andre Drummond and their fourth with Jose Calderon, the Pistons are remaking themselves at both ends as the season hits the two-thirds pole. What they miss on the defensive end without Drummond, they’re getting back on the other side with Calderon, who was brilliant with 23 points on 10 of 13 shooting – including an opportunistic driving layup to tie the game at 100 – to go with 10 assists, five rebounds and three steals against three turnovers. Calderon now has 30 assists and six turnovers with the Pistons. When they looked rattled in the second half, falling 10 points behind after leading by 13 early in the second quarter and committing turnovers in bunches, Calderon reeled them back in with his words and his actions. “It doesn’t matter if we make mistakes – everyone is going to make a turnover one time. Just don’t make two in a row,” Calderon said. “Just slow down, let’s get one shot, but don’t get another turnover. We want to play with pace, (but) one thing is playing fast, other thing is shoot fast. We’ve got to try to find that combination.” “That’s what a point guard does,” Lawrence Frank said. “We had seven turnovers in the third quarter. We were just too sloppy with the basketball. The game started to tilt in their favor. He, not just settling us down, but making some key shots, just kept the guys confident. To have that guy to be able to give that calmness to our group, just with his play, he was very, very impressive tonight.” But the night belonged to Calderon’s old Toronto Raptor teammate, Charlie V, not just for his 18 points, but at least as much for his 13 rebounds, including a critical defensive board on the possession that set up his game-winner. “I’m trying to fill in the void for Andre,” he said. “Andre was a big part of what we’re trying to do. In his void, other guys are trying to step up and I’ve taken that challenge.” “When he starts hitting shots, you know he’s going to be ready always to shoot it,” Calderon said. “When he hits that first one or two, he is caliente,” – ‘hot” in Spanish “The last two games, he’s been like that.” “Charlie was huge,” Frank said. “Great job on the glass, and obviously the huge rebound at the end after we got the stop. But it’s the ability to play both ends as he’s done the last two games, because we all know what he can do. Offensively, he’s a very, very skilled guy. As long as we keep moving the ball, the ball will find the open man.” Greg Monroe recorded his 23rd double-double of the season with 14 points, 13 boards, four assists and four steals. It marked the first time the Pistons have had three players with double-doubles in the same game since Rasheed Wallace, Antonio McDyess and Chauncey Billups did it on Feb. 6, 2008 against Miami. “As a team, we did a good job of staying poised,” said Monroe, who logged 35 minutes after playing 40 on Friday as the Pistons wrapped up a stretch of five games in seven nights. “Charlie hit a bit shot, but we got some stops late, executed on offense. It definitely is a testament to the growth of our team. Guys know what it takes to win games like this. We’ve been in this position a lot this season.” The Pistons also got 19 points from Stuckey and 12 from Bynum as part of a 49-point bench effort. Frank, one night after shortening the rotation to eight, used nine on Saturday, but Slava Kravtsov saw just four first-half minutes. “It was a great fight,” Frank said. “We had to keep on throwing different combinations. I’m just proud of our grit. That game looked like it was going south and we stayed the course.” True Blue Pistons",Raw Data
130,"Chiney Ogwumike had 20 points and 12 rebounds to lead No. 6 Stanford to a 69-56 victory over No. 20 Colorado on Sunday. Joslyn Tinkle added 16 points and Toni Kokenis chipped in 15 points for the host Cardinal (18-2, 7-1 Pac-12), which won its fourth consecutive game at home and seventh victory in eight games. Stanford got a scare when Ogwumike collided with a Colorado player with 8:09 left. Both players fell to the ground and Ogwumike came up hobbling on her left leg. She remained in the game for a time after having her left ankle taped but had a slight limp in the limited action she saw in the final minutes. ''When Chiney went out of the game we had to step it up by communicating and talking and make sure we were on the same page,'' Tinkle said. ''They (Colorado) were kind of making a run and we needed to just be poised.'' Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer said Ogwumike just tweaked her ankle a little bit and should be ok. Stanford held an edge in shooting, converting 49 percent of its shots compared to 36 percent for Colorado (15-4, 4-4). The Cardinal had four players in double figures in scoring. ''We wanted to try and keep only two players in double figures, that is the key to beating Stanford and that did not happen,'' Colorado coach Linda Lappe said. ''Every time you make a mistake they (Stanford) look to capitalize on it.'' Colorado was led by Jamee Swan with 14 points and 6 rebounds. Chucky Jeffery added 13 points for the Buffaloes. ''Swan came in and hurt us,'' VanDerveer said. ''That was an extremely physical game.'' Stanford led at halftime 35-26 and came out strong to start the second half. The Cardinal went on a 16-2 run in a span of five minutes and increased the lead to 51-30 with 14:26 to play after Tinkle hit a mid-range jumper. Freshman Bonnie Samuelson made her first two Pac-12 3-pointers back-to-back for the Cardinal during the stretch. Colorado didn't go away, however, scoring the next 12 points in a three-minute stretch to narrow the Stanford lead to 51-42 with 10:47 to play after Jeffery stole a Cardinal pass and converted a fast-break lay-up. ''I liked our guard play tonight,'' VanDerveer said. ''Credit Colorado, they were down 20 (points) and really made a strong run back. We turned it over a couple of times during that (stretch). They (Colorado) are a very, very capable team. They just got super aggressive in the second half and we have to take better care of the ball.'' With the score 55-46 in favor of Stanford, Kokenis hit a 3-pointer for the Cardinal and was fouled with 6:18 to play. Kokenis missed the free throw but Ogwumike grabbed the rebound and scored. The five-point play for Stanford was the key sequence late in the game and gave the Cardinal a 60-46 lead. ''That (five-point play) was huge for us,'' VanDerveer said. Colorado freshman forward Arielle Roberson, who averages 13.2 points per game, was held to two points. ''She (Robertson) could never get going, she didn't take very good shots,'' Lappe said. ''You have to credit Stanford's defense, they really keyed on her.'' Colorado committed 18 turnovers to 13 for Stanford. The Buffaloes won the battle of the boards, 39-33. The Cardinal swept the two-game season series with the Buffaloes. Stanford won the first meeting 57-40 at Boulder on January 4th.",Raw Data

But her second scalp of the week has set up an uncomfortable semifinal, against best friend Sara Errani, who also happens to be the doubles partner she's claimed three grand slam titles alongside. Having disposed of Angelique Kerber in the third round on Wednesday, Vinci was in solid form again as she took just an hour and 18 minutes to beat her Australian opponent 6-2 6-4. Errani, the No.5 seed Sara, disposed of Russia's Nadia Petrova 6-4 0-6 6-3 to set up a clash that will bring forward mixed emotions for both players. ""It will be different mentally because I know her, she's like a sister for me and we play doubles together all the time,"" Errani told the Tour's official website. ""Normally she's with me on my side of the net and not on the other one, so to see her on the other side is tough because one of us will lose. ""She's an amazing person outside the court. Outside the court she will always try to help you when she can. She's like a sister to me. We stay together maybe 300 days a year. Of course we have had a lot of good moments together. ""I will have to think about it as just another tennis match, and not that it's against her. I just have to go on the court and do my best. The good thing is one of us will be in the finals here.""

Czech Kvitova hit 37 winners compared to Radwanska's six and will now face Caroline Wozniacki in the semis. The Dane edged a grueling match with Marion Bartoli, of France, to win 4-6 6-1 6-4. ""It was disappointing to lose that first set after I had been up; I'm happy I turned it around,"" Wozniacki said. ""In the third set I was down 2-0 and it could have been 3-0, and all of a sudden it wasn't looking good, but I kept fighting and every game was close, and I'm happy I ended up winning it.""

132,"They notched their second win since the break ended and fifth in a row, beating the Los Angeles Clippers 116-90 on Thursday night behind 31 points from Tony Parker. ''Tony's been a huge part of us playing that well. He's been the one who is most consistent,'' said Tim Duncan, who had nine points. ''Everything kind of clicked together. We made a lot of shots. They just couldn't get their footing.'' The Spurs led all the way in beating the Clippers for the first time this season and improving to an NBA-best 22-10 on the road, where they've also won five in a row. ''It was a complete butt-kicking from the start in every way you can count,'' Clippers coach and former Spurs player Vinny Del Negro said. Parker had seven assists and no turnovers in 28 minutes and Danny Green added 15 points. The West-leading Spurs tied their season-best with 59-percent shooting, hit eight 3-pointers and made 22 of 28 free throws. They had lost both previous meetings with the Clippers in November. ''We're not that good and they're not that bad,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ''I think it's because we already played one. Too long of a layoff (for the Clippers).'' Matt Barnes scored 18 points, Blake Griffin had 17 and Jamal Crawford 15 as the Clippers' four-game winning streak ended in their first game after the break. Chris Paul, MVP in Houston last weekend with 20 points and 15 assists, was held to four points on 1-of-6 shooting and three assists. ''It's very humbling, but it happens,'' Griffin said. ''There's going to be games where you feel like nothing's going your way, so we need to get back to what made us successful against San Antonio. We've got to have a good practice tomorrow, go over our mistakes and bounce back against Utah on Saturday.'' The Clippers have lost their first game coming out of the break in nine of the last 10 years, including five in a row. They came in trailing the Spurs by 4 1/2 games for the best record in the NBA, but they never got a run going and their defense didn't do much. The biggest excitement during the game was generated by a fan who made a half-court shot during a timeout to win a new car. ''They just beat us, beat us bad,'' Paul said. ''Luckily it wasn't a Game 7 or our last game of the season. They came out and executed. Tony was in a rocking chair all night. We just let him go wherever he wanted to, and we never really could get going offensively. It's a very humbling loss.'' The Spurs led by 28 points to start the fourth quarter, when Parker and most of the other Spurs starters rested while fans hit the exits in droves. The Clippers equaled their worst loss of the season. ''It's only one game. It doesn't mean anything,'' Parker said. ''You have to look at the big picture. We want to win a championship.'' San Antonio put on a free-throw shooting clinic in the third quarter, making 16 of 20, including 12 during a 14-4 run that extended its lead to 81-53. Popovich said he tried to call a couple plays, but Parker overrode him. ''He's really matured as a player,'' Popovich said. ''He just used to be a scoring point guard. Now there's a whole new world out there. He's a complete player.'' Parker said, ''He's always trusting me and letting me grow as a point guard and calling plays. Before in my career I was always looking at him. Now I don't look at him.'' The Spurs shot 63 percent to lead 58-43 at halftime. Parker scored 17 points in the half, while Griffin was the only Clipper in double figures with 13 points. Paul didn't make his first basket until the final 3 minutes of the second quarter. San Antonio made its first six shots to start the game and used a 17-4 run, including seven by Manu Ginobili, to close out the first quarter leading 34-21.

133,"Natalie Achonwa had a career-high 23 points and 12 rebounds as one of three players with double-doubles. Senior All-America guard Skylar Diggins had 12 points and a season-high 10 assists for her first double-double of the season in Notre Dame's 109-70 win over Utah State Saturday afternoon at Purcell Pavilion. Wright added 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Diggins finished with 12 points along with 10 assists. It was the first time in seven years that three Irish women recorded double-doubles. Achonwa credited Diggins' ability to break the Utah State press for many of her easy baskets. ""I think we have a point guard that wants to push the tempo, and we play in a program that looks to push the tempo,"" Achonwa said. ""I think we posts need to make sure we keep up. That makes it a lot easier to beat the press."" Notre Dame (6-1) controlled the paint, with Achonwa and her teammates getting easy layups in the low post off feeds from the perimeter, both on the break and in half-court sets. In an attempt to stop those easy baskets, Utah State (2-7) tried collapsing on the low post, but often was whistled for fouls. Aggies guard Jenna Johnson fouled out just three minutes into the second half. ""Obviously there was a skill difference and a size difference and a physical difference today, and as the game wore on, it became more and more evident,"" Utah State coach Jerry Finkbeiner said. ""Achonwa was in the right place at the right time, and their guards got her easy shots."" Achonwa was 10 for 13 from the field and made each of her three foul shots. Notre Dame shot 69.4 percent (25 for 36) while building a 66-49 halftime lead, and finished at 52 percent for the game. Playing with many of its reserves, Notre Dame outscored Utah State 28-8 over the first 10 minutes of the second half. Utah State started the game aggressively, pursuing a fast tempo and forcing early turnovers with its press. The Aggies were 7 for 14 from 3-point range in the first half, but only 1 for 12 in the second half. ""Utah State played extremely well in the first half,"" Irish coach Muffet McGraw said. ""We had a complete breakdown defensively in the first half. We had absolutely no desire to guard. I think we responded a little better in the second half. We played better defense.""

134,"I had never been into gymnastics — never been drawn into its drama, captivated by its beauty and nerves or affected by the performances that crush some dreams while completing others. Until these Olympics. Until Jordyn Wieber shook under the weight of what she lost, and Gabby Douglas was lifted higher and happier than she’s ever been by the individual all-around gold she’d won, and the U.S. women’s team basked in the fact it had become the second American team to take home the team gold. All of these things contributed to my conversion — my understanding, really — of all that gymnastics offers, the ways it reaches us emotionally. But it was my daughter who drove home the point. I was sitting at the Greenwich Arena, waiting for another day of competition to go on, thinking about these things, when my wife emailed me. Did I have a second to video chat? My 3-year-old wanted to show me something. My little girl is a bundle of joy and humor, soaking up the world now, seeing things every day we take for granted and reflecting them back to us. I turned on the video chat and, voila, she announced with no buildup and utter seriousness: “Daddy! I can do tricks! I can do gym-astics!” And she did, running through our home in Kansas City, flinging herself onto the floor, doing what looked like a slow-motion, 1.2-scoring floor exercise. She’d been watching at home — as all of America had — at what the Fierce Five had accomplished. And I saw it on that video screen, past the medals or dollars to be made or the glory to be had: A little girl, my little girl, simply inspired by what five American teenagers had done. It was the purest and happiest moment for me of these games. Can anybody top the Brits when it comes to mixing fashion, partying and the Olympics? You be the judge. There is no Olympic adrenaline rush like watching Usain Bolt in the 100 meters. The 100 is the one event I won’t miss at an Olympics because of the vibe, from the cocky intros on. The best part of an Olympics is actually in meeting people. Elaine Collins, at race walking — yes, race walking — talked about her daughter’s hopes of walking in the 2016 Rio Olympics. While training, her daughter takes flak from people who see her and think the sport looks funny. (It looks like my kids trying to get to the slide at the pool with the lifeguard yelling ""NO RUNNING!”). She also explained how race walkers around the world truly act as a community. I have never had interest in race walking, but I learned something from some woman I just happened to meet in a crowd. But my favorite Olympic memory is Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner. When he lined up, I was overcome by the feeling that I was watching society improve, through community. Some runners, fans and journalists had said Pistorius, the first amputee to run track in the Olympics, had an advantage because his blades are better than legs. After Pistorius advanced to the 400-meter semifinal, I waited for him under the stadium and talked to Canadian runner Daundre Barnaby. Did he think Pistorius had an advantage? I’ll never forget what Barnaby said: “He’s human. He’s human. So it doesn’t matter. He’s human just like the rest of us.’’ When Pistorius lost in the semifinal, Grenada’s Kirani James, the eventual gold medal winner, took off his nameplate and offered it to Pistorius, who took off his own and gave it to James. James told me it was just spur of the moment. It was a beautiful thing: People watched, learned and became friends. That’s the Olympics. Miss any of Sunday's Olympics closing ceremony? Don't worry, we've got the best photos right here. My favorite memory of the London Olympics wasn’t Gabby Douglas or Michael Phelps. It wasn’t Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake. It wasn’t the entire nation of Great Britain rumbling with joy over Jessica Ennis and Andy Murray and Mo Farah. It was when a 22-year-old girl from Ohio, someone you’ve never heard of until a couple of weeks ago, stepped to the podium, accepted her gold medal and showed the world that every single one of us can get over the worst things in life and become our best. I had met Kayla Harrison a few months before, when I visited the dojo near Boston where she now trains. ( Read story) She had moved there for two reasons: Because she wanted to become America’s first judo gold medalist. And because she needed to escape the horrific experience in Ohio. Harrison began judo as an 8-year-old girl when her mother wanted her to learn to protect herself. She was a prodigy, but soon her coach — a man 16 years her senior named Daniel Doyle, who’d take her to international tournaments with a reign of protection and fear over young Kayla — began to sexually abuse her. After years of abuse, Kayla finally walked into a courtroom to take the witness stand, and her former coach pleaded guilty and took a 10-year sentence. She showed up in Boston as a broken teenage girl. But the two trainers at the dojo, two-time Olympic medalist Jimmy Pedro and his father, big Jim, made it their charge to build this girl back up. They also happened to turn the joyful, lovable young lady into an Olympic gold medalist. On the podium, tears streamed down Harrison’s cheeks. She’d began to talk publicly about her sexual abuse since the Jerry Sandusky scandal broke last year, but that was not what she thought about when she was being crowned an Olympic champion. She thought only of what she’d accomplished, not what she’d overcome. It was a moment infused with more meaning than any athletic achievement at London 2012. To me, Kayla Harrison had become America’s greatest hero of these Olympics. See who contributed to the United States winning the Olympic medal race. GALLERY: US gold-medal winners. My fear was palpable when I arrived in London — fear of terrorist attacks they said surely were coming and the lack of Brit preparedness for such an event. Fear is one of those funny emotions that can only be handled one way: Head on. So every day I entered the Olympic Park anyway, and the British soldiers guarding the gates are my best memories. They were a late addition, and their efforts were not without cost. The newspapers said use of troops at these games meant extending stays for others fighting in foreign lands and likely for themselves later. They were proud to be there, anyway. This was their country and their Olympics, and their presence said nothing is going to happen to you on my watch, not if I can help it. And nothing did. It was because of them that Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt and Mo Farah were allowed to be the stars of these games, why maybe my favorite athlete, Russian swimmer Yevgeny Korotyshkin, was able finally to claim a medal after 12 years of trying to exit an Olympics with one, why Gabby Douglas and Jordan Burroughs were able to steal hearts. We all are guilty sometimes of paying a lot of lip service to remembering the troops and who the real heroes are, myself included. Maybe, it was the daily walk past them, but I leave the games thinking about them and their American counterparts and all of those people who face far greater fear head-on, daily. That is true national pride, and my hope is they get a Farah-like victory lap courtesy of their countrymen at some point. I know I will remember them fondly. — Jen Floyd Engel Women's soccer: I'm sold I made the decision to take the two-hour train ride from London to Manchester when I thought Great Britain would play the United States in the semifinals of women’s soccer. Team GB vs. the world’s best soccer team would be a hoot inside Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, England’s answer to the Green Bay Packers and Lambeau Field. Well, the Brits got derailed and suddenly Canada stood between Team USA, Hope Solo and the gold-medal game. When it comes to women’s soccer, Canada is our Washington Generals, losers of nearly 30 straight to Team USA. I stuck with my travel plans because I wanted to visit a city soccer-crazy enough to be home to two mammoth soccer stadiums five miles apart. I had no idea I would witness the greatest women’s soccer game ever played. I had even less of an idea that Canada’s Christine Sinclair would make me fall in love with the women’s game. In the final 30 seconds of extra time, in a game that lasted more than three hours and was as physical as a rugby match, Alex Morgan knocked in a header to end the match 4-3 and advance the US to a showdown with Japan. But it was Sinclair who made the biggest impression on this soccer novice, as she nearly single-handedly beat the world’s No. 1 squad, scoring all three Canadian goals. Her impact was so great and her presence so overpowering that I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I’ll never forget Sinclair. She was my favorite athlete of these games. She made my trek to Manchester worthwhile. My lasting impression of the London Games is not of Bolt, Wiggo, Phelps, Gabby, Ennis, Misty and Kerri, or LeBron. It is not of the winners, but of the ones who might have been. In this polyglot of cultures, sports and status, there were just as many ways to lose. And how they reacted said much about who these athletes, many of whom I had never covered, are. Mark Cavendish, when he did not win his expected gold for Great Britain in the cycling road race – far from it, in 28th place – complained that his showing was the fault of Australians and others, who had conspired against him. The Japan women’s soccer coach Norio Sasaki, after his team’s 2-1 loss to the United States, had consoled his players, who were in tears on the field. “If I look at it objectively, they all played well,” he said. “There is nothing we should be ashamed of.” Marc Gasol, who scored 17 points in 17 minutes, could not do more to help Spain beat the United States because he was in severe foul trouble. Asked about the officiating, Gasol declined comment because to do so, he said, would be to disrespect the game and the winners. The Olympics can be the best of times and the worst of times, yes, but these games spoke to me through Dickens another way: how we handle the disappointment of Great Expectations.",Raw Data
135,An Argentine police officer was in critical condition after being shot during a clash with football hooligans which saw nine people arrested. Judge Alejandra Rodenas told reporters Monday that the violence took place during a confrontation between hooligans supporting Argentine clubs Rosario Central and Newell's Old Boys. Sunday's match between the two rivals at Newell's stadium - a practice game weeks before the regular season resumes - was called off before it started by security officials. Violence is endemic in Argentine football with threats in and out of the stadium accompanying almost every match.

136,"Lampard warned against US move Eurosport - Mon, Feb 18, 2013 20:28 GMT The workers, who are demanding a wage increase, meal vouchers and private health insurance for their families, staged a one-day stoppage and threatened a full-blown strike from next week. The famous arena, which staged the final matches in the 1950 World Cup, is being refurbished for this year's Confederations Cup and next year's World Cup at a cost of 900 million reais. It is due to re-open for a friendly between Brazil and England on June 2 and stage its first competitive match, the Confederations Cup tie between Mexico and Italy, on June 16. Work has already overshot the original deadline of December 31 and has been progressing almost non-stop, with three daily shifts, as the deadline looms. ""It was a warning for the construction companies,"" said Wagner Antunes Siqueira, a director of the Rio de Janeiro heavy industry workers' union. ""We are going to wait for negotiations on Friday. If there is no (agreement), we will hold an assembly to vote on an indefinite strike."" Four of the six stadiums to be used for the Confederations Cup, a dress rehearsal for the World Cup, are still not finished. Only Fortaleza's Castelao and Belo Horizonte's Mineirao have so far re-opened. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke warned three weeks ago that there would be no further extension beyond the new deadline of April 15. ""We cannot go beyond this date. There cannot be any further delays. All the stadiums must be ready by then,"" he said.",Raw Data

The first point to make is that, while we all love to compare players, one of these players has now retired (Zidane) and the other is still playing (Iniesta). In truth, players are always looked upon with a greater reverence once they have retired than they are when they are playing. The phrase: ""You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone"" applies in football just as much as it does in life Iniesta: Guillem thinks the Barca maestro is better than Zidane - but do you? Once they have stopped playing we tend to forget the missed chances, the bad games they played, the moments of petulance that often caused problems for the team they were playing for, rather than against. But what we do have is a mass of statistics, and while stats may not tell the whole story, they certainly go some way to painting a picture as to who actually was/is the best. Of course while Zidane's stats are now set in stone, Iniesta's are constantly changing. The fact that we are already discussing whether he is, or is not, a better player than Zidane while he is still playing and more than a year shy of his 30th birthday is probably a reasonable pointer to the fact that even if he is not yet up to the Frenchman's standards, and personally I think he is, he almost certainly will be by the time he hangs up his boots. Or not? Let me put my case... Honours won with clubs In terms of trophies and honours won, the achievements of Iniesta put Zidane in the shade. The Frenchman, who played for Cannes, Bordeaux, Juventus and Real Madrid, won two Serie A league titles in 1996-97 and 1997-98; one La Liga in 2002-03; and one Champions League in 2001-02. Zidane was on the losing side in Champions League finals with Juventus against Borussia Dortmund in 1997 (1-3) and Real Madrid 1998 (0-1) Iniesta, on the other hand, has only ever played as a senior for Barcelona. Since making his debut in 2002, he has won five La Liga titles (probably soon to be six this year) and these five have been won in the last seven years: 2004-05, 2005-6, 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11. In Europe he has won three Champions League titles - 2005-6, 2008-9, 2010-11 - and has never been on the losing side in a Champions League final International honours won Internationally the records of the two players are equally impressive. Both made their full international debuts aged 22. In the 12 years Zidane played for France he notched 108 caps and 31 goals. Iniesta has played for the full international side 78 times over the past seven years during which time he has scored 11 goals. Both players have won the World Cup with their countries, Zidane in 1998 and Iniesta in 2010. Both players have scored in the World Cup final, Zidane heading two of France's goals against Brazil and Iniesta hitting the winner against the Netherlands. Both players have won the European Championship, too, Zidane in 2000 and Iniesta in 2008 and 2012. The victory in 2012 made Spain the only side ever to retain the European Football Championship. Iniesta, injury permitting will almost certainly go on to equal if not better the number of international caps won by Zidane. But in addition to his senior caps it should be mentioned that Iniesta has represented his country no fewer than 123 times since 2000 at Under 15, 17, 19, 20, 21 as well as at full international level, winning the Under-17 European Championship in 2001 and Under-19 European Championship in 2002. International awards Zidane has received more international award than Iniesta winning the FIFA World Player of the Year three times, in 1998, 2000 and 2003, and the Ballon D'Or in 1998. The two awards were amalgamated in 2010. Iniesta took the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award in 2012. The Barcelona midfielder, three times in the top four of the FIFA Ballon d'Or, hasn't won as many personal awards as Zidane but Zidane did not have the likes of Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo around at the time Iniesta's individual awards: UEFA Euro Team of the Tournament (2): 2008, 2012 UEFA Euro 2008 Man Of The Match: Semi-final vs. Russia La Liga Spanish Player of the Year: 2009 La Liga's Best Attacking Midfielder (3): 2009, 2011, 2012 Trofeo Alfredo di Stéfano: 2nd best player in La Liga 2008-09, 3rd 2011-12. FIFA/FIFPro World XI (4): 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 UEFA Team of the Year (4): 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 Ballon d'Or: 4th Place 2009 FIFA Puskás Award: Second place 2009 2010 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team 2010 FIFA World Cup Man Of The Match vs. Chile, Paraguay and Final vs Netherlands Much has been made of the fact that Iniesta is not as great as Zidane because of the players he has played with. Certainly Iniesta is playing for arguably the greatest club side in the history of the game, and precisely one of the reasons they are such a great side is because Iniesta not only plays for them but is one of the leading lights of this great Barcelona side. Much is made of the fact that Iniesta has the likes of Messi to feed with assists. But it is also worth noting that Zidane only ever won one La Liga title and one Champions League despite playing alongside players like, Spain's captain Fernando Hierro, the Brazilian Ronaldo, Luis Figo and arguably the greatest legend in the history of Spanish football, Raul. At Juventus he played with following players during his stay: World Cup winners Alessandro Del Piero, Didier Deschamps, Felipe Inzaghi, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet. Antonio Conte (Champions League and five-time Serie A winner), Edgar Davids (Champions League and three-time Serie A winner). Plus, I wouldn't say the France team that won the 1998 World Cup was bad and that Zidane did everything for the side, as it featured the likes of Patrick Vieira, Laurent Blanc, Bixente Lizarazu, Youri Djorkaeff, Deschamps, Robert Pires, Henry, Lilian Thuram and Trezeguet. Other players' comments In 2009, after Barcelona had beaten Manchester United in the Champions League final, Wayne Rooney said, ""Forget Messi, Iniesta is the best player in the world."" And since that date, Iniesta has only got better. Robert Pires said only last week: ""For me Iniesta is the best player at Barca. We always talk about Messi, but without Iniesta, Barcelona area different team. He is the master of the team. He's the one who sets the pace for the whole team."" Juan Roman Riquelme: ""I watch Iniesta and realise that even at my age I could be learning new things."" David Silva: ""The press often ask me about whether Messi or Ronaldo is the best, but for me something is very clear. Andres Iniesta is the number one. Sergio Ramos: ""He is the enlightened one. Someone touched by a magic wand. He commands so much respect on the pitch. As a football lover I am proud to have played with him. He makes the difference and does things that no one else can do."" Fernando Torres: ""When he has the ball, it's like everything else stops - like the camera going in slow motion. I've been playing with him since we were 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly."" Someone once said that in football average to good players are normally strong against the weak but sometimes weak against the strong. What defines great players is that they are, almost without exception, strong against both the weak and the strong. That in a nutshell is Andres Iniesta. The little genius for the enormous occasions. Fernando Torres sums it up perfectly. ""I've been playing with him since I was 15,"" he says, ""And I have never seen him play badly."" Think of the last-gasp dagger to the heart of Chelsea that earned Barcelona a place in the 2009 Champions League final; or the stunning pass that put Samuel Eto'o through to score in the final against Manchester United; or perhaps the winning strike that earned Spain their first World Cup against the Dutch in 2010. Big-time games call for big-time players, and there's no-one bigger than Iniesta. Tito Vilanova asked Iniesta what lessons he learnt the previous season. Clearly Andrés had felt that by staying on the wing, where Pep Guardiola often placed him, he was not helping the team as much as he thought he could. Tito told him not to worry. The arrival of Jordi Alba was going to give the wing to the full back and Tito told Iniesta to pretty much do whatever he wanted - and now he is playing in freer role in midfield from where his silvery, seemingly effortless skills can terrorize defences, much like he does in the red of Spain. He is becoming even greater. But why is he not given the credit he deserves? Well probably for a very similar reason to why Zidane has been feted as the greatest midfielder ever - primarily because he stood head and shoulders above the vast majority of players he played with. His absence from the 2002 World Cup from the French side stood out like a sore thumb. Iniesta is a genius who just happens to have played all his life for what is arguably the greatest club side in the history of the game, who also have in Lionel Messi , probably the greatest player ever and also for a country that stands, at the moment, above any other footballing nation. Iniesta controls games with an economy of effort, a skill and a guile that combines the passing genius of Xavi and the dribbling wizadry of Messi. While Messi is at Barcelona, Iniesta will never receive the credit he deserves, yet ironically it can be argued that without mercurial input of Iniesta, Messi would not be quite the force he is now. But perhaps another of the reasons that he doesn't get the credit he deserves is because he doesn't have the ego of so many of the pretenders to his throne. His arrogance is reserved to his performances on the field and not his antics off it. He has never been sent off in the 10+ years he has been playing in the Barcelona first team, or while playing for his country. Zidane's volatile nature earned him 12 red cards, the last one coming in the 2006 final for a flying butt on Materazzi that meant the Frenchman could not take a penalty in the shoot-out that followed and that France subsequently lost. On that note Zidane quit professional football. When Iniesta finally decides that enough is enough, it will almost certainly be a more appropriate departure. I know that doesn't qualify one as better than the other, but I think the rest (stats and impressions) does. I remember saying that Gareth Bale was at his age as good as Ronaldo at his and many people dismissed the idea, which is now being mentioned by many. Or that an 18-year-old Messi was going to become one of the top three players in the world. But I also said that Reyes was better than Cristiano Ronaldo at the time (which he was) but Ronaldo since then has become a force of nature. Saying that Iniesta is better than Zidane is as bold a statement as any of those (and perhaps impossible to demonstrate, even though I think there is enough evidence in this piece). We might not agree but I would love to hear those that disagree (and give me your reasons) and those that feel brave enough to agree. What would football be without a good argument!",Raw Data

I think that who we take, and we havent decided that yet, that person will add to that mix and I think that theyll improve  coming in as a rookie with all of these veterans around who have won European championships and won gold medals, and have ability to bring whoever we pick up to speed fast. On how closely the organization will follow the 2012-2013 NCAA Womens Basketball season: I would follow it either way, but there will be a lot of trips made to a lot of places. Obviously were really excited. It means a lot to our fans, it means a lot to our organization. Were just really excited and kind of speechless at the moment. We came into the Draft Lottery today, Corey and I, with no expectations and, again, like he said, we knew that anyone we would be able to add to the pieces we already have would be good. This is obviously icing on the cake. On how it felt being sequestered at ESPN and knowing the result in advance: It was tough, but it was fun to watch his reaction too, on TV. Hes usually a cool customer and doesnt show any emotion, but he had a hard time holding that one in.",Raw Data
139,"The free-agent left-hander and the Pirates have finalized their two-year deal, agreeing to adjusted terms after Liriano suffered a broken right arm over the holidays, according to major league sources. Liriano, 29, reached preliminary agreement with the Pirates on a two-year, $12.75 million contract shortly before Christmas. He still could earn that entire sum but will assume more risk under the revised terms, sources said. If Liriano misses time next season because of an ongoing problem with his right arm, his first-year salary will be reduced, according to a source. His second-year salary will remain the same as long as he is not sidelined because of the same specific injury. Liriano was healthy all of last season, going a combined 6-12 with a 5.34 ERA for the Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox. He is 53-54 with a 4.40 ERA lifetime.",Raw Data
140,"PORTLAND, Ore. — After his nearly dubious triple-double — 14 points, 10 assists and nine turnovers — in a 101-90 loss to the Golden State Warriors, Bulls point guard Derrick Rose stood at his locker late Saturday night in Oakland, Calif., trying to make sense of probably his worst game of the season. “It was just one of those games where it wasn’t going our way,” he said. “We tried to force it. It was just one of those nights.” Someone asked if this was the kind of performance ‘‘where he obsessed over the stat sheet or simply threw it away?” “Both,” he said. “I look at it and then I threw it away. It’s actually right there.” Rose pointed to a spot about 10 feet from his locker where, sure enough, a crumpled-up box score rested. In the grand scheme of things, there wasn’t much else for the Bulls to do after one of their worst losses of the season. It snapped a six-game winning streak and was their first double-digit loss since a 104-92 defeat at Boston on Dec. 3. Rose said part of the problem — and the reason for his high number of turnovers — was the trapping defense the Warriors used against the pick-and-roll plays with Rose and power forward Carlos Boozer. “The way they did it, they had the guy that was sticking Carlos and then they had someone right behind him coming over,” Rose said. “So if I drove baseline, he’d cut me off and the guy sticking Carlos would deny him. If I drove the middle, the guy on the side of [Boozer] would come out and double-team and someone would always be on him. “It was just something we haven’t seen before.” Coach Tom Thibodeau, though, wasn’t buying that explanation. “I don’t know if the traps were successful,” Thibodeau said. “Our turnovers came from over-dribbling and dribbling into a crowd. They were collapsing on dribble penetration. When we made the simple plays and just hit the open man, that’s how we scored effectively. We scored [at a normal pace] for the first three quarters, and then we struggled to score.” Still, the Bulls had a 65-53 lead midway through the third quarter, but then scored just 25 points in the final 18 minutes. However, offense wasn’t the main problem. “We didn’t stop them,” Rose said. “They were getting everything that they wanted, and they were playing with confidence. We had a couple of chances to blow the game open. We were up by a large amount, and our defense just didn’t hold them. “If our offense isn’t going, we have to hold them on defense, plain and simple. Our defense is what makes us a good team. That wasn’t us ­tonight.” But if there’s one thing the Bulls have shown this season, it’s resiliency. They’ve dropped consecutive games only three times and usually follow losses with big performances. The same thing can be said of Rose. He has had few dud games this season, but has bounced back with solid performances nearly every time. The best example came after he had 17 points on 5-for-17 shooting with four turnovers in a loss at Charlotte on Jan. 12. In the next game, he had 29 points (11-for-22 shooting) and 10 rebounds in a win at Indiana and followed that with 34 points the next night in a win over Miami. After consecutive losses to Orlan-do and at Boston — games where Rose shot a combined 12-for-30 — he bounced back with 30 points and 11 assists in an overtime victory against Houston, adding a game-tying, buzzer-beating three-pointer at the end of regulation in that game for good measure. Rose will look to do the same tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers at the Rose Garden.",Raw Data

142,"What an impressive rookie Brandon Knight has proven to be. I’ve been impressed almost since day one. He has some very special qualities in his game and you can tell he’s driven, but driven in the right way. He’s not going to get under the skin of his teammates. Hopefully, he gets under the skin of opponents, but he’s the kind of guy teammates respect and like and want to be on the floor with. His ability is way above average. He takes a few steps back occasionally, but always manages many more steps forward. Compare his game now to how he was in the preseason and even the beginning of the regular season and you’d see he’s made a quantum leap. He understands the league as much as you could expect in his first year with a shortened training camp and only one year of college behind him. The first thing that jumps out at you about Brandon is his speed and quickness. He can beat almost anybody up and down the court. He has the ability to get to the basket and yet has the ability to get his feet together and knock down threes, even at crunch time. He doesn’t shy away from anything. He has quick hands defensively, the ability to stay in front of people and a great handle. The way the pro game is played, I believe, is only going to help him. He sees the floor extremely well. He’s made some incredible passes. I remember a bounce pass into the post to Greg Monroe for a layup that he somehow was able to thread through defenders. The pass was red hot, but when you’re in the NBA you expect your big man to be good enough to catch it and Greg obviously is. Some of those passes in college would be a turnover, but they’re not in the pros and he’s starting to understand that. He was maybe hesitant to make them early, but now he knows NBA players – especially the quality of Greg Monroe – can make catches and finish. Brandon is a very bright guy. He’s mature beyond his years. He wants to help all his teammates get better and I think they immediately understood that. Of course he wants to become an All-Star. Of course he wants to be among the best point guards in the league someday. But, you can tell, he also wants to help his team win and wants to help his teammates have more success on the court when he’s out there. Guys pick up on that. They know this is not about him; it’s about the Detroit Pistons. Brandon is sharp enough to know that all the honors will come once he’s made himself and his teammates better. You’ve got to like a guy like that. I think Brandon’s abilities are perfect for the NBA at this time. The point guard position is still a position of tremendous responsibility. You have to run the offense. You have to help your teammates play at the top of their game. You have to make difficult decisions and make them on the fly. But you also have to be able to score – and be able to defend another point guard who is trying to make plays like you are and also trying to score like you are. Point guards have more all-around skill now than they’ve ever had. That makes it more difficult to play that position and more difficult to defend that position. Brandon seems to do a marvelous job of both for such a young player with such limited experience. I’m excited about him. He’s fun to watch. I think his future is as bright as any young point guard in the league. Brandon is one of the reasons people should come out and watch this team play. They’re going to have nights where they stub their toes, because they’re a young team still learning a new system and trying to compete in the greatest league in the world. But you can see, if you watch these games, that the future is bright. Not just inside, where Greg Monroe is almost a guaranteed future star down the road, but also at that point guard spot. Brandon is just too smart and too talented and too driven not to end up being an elite guard in our league. When you have the point guard and the center position in the hands of standout or star-caliber players, you’re on your way. I’ve got to go back to quoting my old partner Dick Motta, who said when he came into the league there were five good centers and five good point guards and years later there were still five good ones at each position. When you have a guy from both lists, you’ve got yourself a heck of a basketball team. And I believe that in the not-too-distant future, the Pistons will have someone on both lists.",Raw Data
143,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. Falcons tight end Tony Gonzalez makes it almost impossible not to root for him. The guy is infinitely likable.* * In this post-Manti Te'o fake girlfriend world, look for disclaimers to become the new normal. I do not know Gonzalez personally. All I know is what he presents, which is an insanely talented tight end and genuinely good guy who has had staying power in a league where that is increasingly difficult. There is also the fact he has never won a championship in his 16 NFL seasons. His first (and only) playoff win came in Year 16, last week when Atlanta shocked Seattle with a last-second, come-from-behind victory to advance to Sunday's NFC Championship Game against San Francisco. There is nothing we the sports media love more than when good guys hang around for a long time without winning a championship. Call this the Ray Bourque phenomenon, Bourque being the Hall of Fame defenseman who after 21 years as a Boston Bruin without a Stanley Cup went to Colorado and etched his name. And here comes the crucial part: In doing so, he changed his legacy. Or so goes the narrative. Change hockey to football, defense to tight end and Boston to Kansas City and you have Gonzalez's story, or almost. He needs another two W's for his championship. In a team sport like football, how much of one's legacy should hinge on championships won? ""I don't think it's fair,"" Gonzalez said when I asked Thursday. His answer was long and extremely thoughtful and he quickly noted a lot of folks were not going to agree. He understands we live in a sports culture ""winning is everything"" and ""ring is the thing"" and ""one for the thumb"". ""I have said that before and, even now, after I have my first playoff victory, I still think the same thing. It's not really fair to judge a player by OK, did he win a Super Bowl or not?' It's about how he played, week in and week out,"" Gonzalez said. He noted the 2003 Kansas Chiefs team he played on that went 13-3, had one of the best offenses in the NFL and arrived at the playoffs and lost to the Indianapolis Colts. Their defense just was not good enough, and that does not crack the top 10 of most heartbreaking ways playoff games have been lost. This is a league where games are decided by kickers going wide right and Playmate's husband's failing to properly field an onside kick. ""That's just how it goes,"" he continued, knowing that of which he speaks. ""You can't say a player isn't Hall of Fame worthy, or a Pro Bowler or anything like that because he's not on a winning team."" But we do. We do this a lot, actually. We say a guy is just not quite as good because of an outcome of a game that may or may not have anything to do with him. Just this past weekend, Denver quarterback Peyton Manning got carved as a choker because, as best I can tell, his defense failed to properly execute the particulars of playing safety in the NFL. This does not make Manning a choker, or Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco a winner. Nor does Flacco, or Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan for that matter, return to choker status if they fail to win this week. A game is an impossibly bad way to define the legacy of a player and body of work is inexact as well. There are just too many variables involved in football to stake the legacies of an individual player based on the success of his team. Yet, we do. And a big reason why this narrative endures is because players and coaches and NFL types buy into this myth. Falcons coach Mike Smith said as much Thursday, though he mistakenly kept saying offseason instead of postseason. ""It's a team sport and I think ultimately everybody knows how you are going to be judged in a team sport. It is how you perform in the (post)season,"" Smith said. ""I really believe your legacy is going to be based on the success you had in the (post)season. It doesn't mean you are not a great player or you haven't been on great teams. It is just very difficult to win in the National Football League."" I do not blame him for the answer. The last thing anybody in Atlanta wants to hear going into Sunday's NFC Championship Game is their coach saying winning or losing does not impact his legacy or that of his players. And while Gonzalez disagrees with that standard, the championship is why he is back. He admitted he would have retired years ago if not for his lack of playoff success. This is his last kick at the can, 95 percent guaranteed. ""The only reason I am at 95 is I don't want to close the window all the way just in case. If we get really, really close and obviously that means getting past this and into the (Super Bowl) and we don't win. Then, OK, we are right there and maybe I can come back and get it,"" Gonzalez said. ""That is the last thing I want to do is chase a Super Bowl."" And the last thing we should do is hinge his legacy on whether he wins one. His legacy is set; the best to ever play the position and a great guy. No asterisk this time because I am confident Gonzalez is exactly who he presents himself to be. A win Sunday, a win or loss on Super Bowl Sunday changes nothing except the last line about how he exited the game he played so well.",Raw Data
144,"Arsene Wenger insists he never considered walking away from arguably the biggest crisis of his 16-year reign as Arsenal manager, but refused to be drawn on speculation that he will remain in charge at the club beyond the end of his current contract in 2014. Wenger's agitated and angry exchanges with journalists ahead of the Champions League clash with Bayern Munich on Tuesday night led many to conclude the veteran boss was cracking under the pressure of another season of indifferent results, but he insists he has no intention of leaving Arsenal. After their FA Cup defeat against Blackburn was quickly followed by a thumping defeat against Bayern, Wenger admits he has been rocked by setbacks he was not expecting and yet quitting is not an option. When asked whether there had been a moment of the last week when he considered resigning as Arsenal boss, Wenger was unequivocal in his response. ""Never, not for one second,"" he said. ""The love for the game and the love to win [keeps me motivated]. ""I will not come out with my feelings [on negative publicity of the last week]. What is important for me is to focus on the next game and try to give my best, like all the players. ""My spark has nothing to do with the length of your life. It is just how you are. You are motivated by how much you want to win and how much you want to be a winner. If I go out against you now in a one on one, you will see that I will beat you. At least if I don't, I will want to beat you. That will be the same so long as I can move."" It was when the questions turned to his future that Wenger gave the biggest hint yet that he may not remain at Arsenal for much longer, insisting he was working to a short term plan and would not consider extending his stay beyond next year for now. ""I have a contract until 2014 and at the moment I am on a short term plan,"" he stated. ""For two reasons. One I have been here for a long time and two, I have to consider what I want to do. That will be considered in 2014."" With smiles and laughter replacing the tension that filled the media room at Arsenal's London Colney training base last Monday, Wenger proceeded to calmly pick his way through a host of questions that would have been greeted with a very different reaction just a few days ago, yet he insists his anger over a misleading story in the Sun newspaper on Monday has dispersed. ""I have calmed down,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Whether the [problems] we have are exaggerated is hard to say. There is emotion and it is down to people who have responsibility to put that into perspective, keep solid and guide the club in the right way. My responsibility is to keep the guideline and to guide the team and the club.""",Raw Data
145,"﻿The Big East conference is looking to add another school, and may sign a TV package that includes multiple networks, commissioner Mike Aresco said Monday. Aresco spoke at a local chamber of commerce breakfast, and talked to reporters afterward. He said the Big East wants to keep its name as it rebrands, and no longer has any plans to expand further west than Texas. ''We probably at some point will add a 12th team,'' Aresco said. ''We are going to have 11 when Navy comes in '15. We'll have 10 this year. There's no urgency, but we think we'll probably think about adding a 12th team.'' Aresco believes the conference realignment picture may be settling down, following the departure of the so-called Catholic seven basketball schools from the Big East and the decisions of Boise State and San Diego State to return to the Mountain West. He said the remaining Big East schools all are large research schools, with similar goals, and have good working relationships. ''I do think as conferences consolidate, as they get bigger, I think they rethink what they are doing, and I think there will be a period of calm,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean it's over.'' Aresco said the conference is getting close on a TV package that he said will add stability to the picture, but could not say when it might be finalized. ''We think we could end up doing a deal with multiple networks, we just don't know yet,'' he said. Aresco lamented the role of money in ending some traditional rivalries in college sports, and cautioned executives that a balance must be maintained between doing what is best financially and doing what is best for college athletics and the college athlete. He said TV games will lose much of their luster if they are played in half-empty arenas or stadiums. He also said he doesn't believe the departure of the Catholic schools from the Big East necessarily means an end to some of the old Big East rivalries. He said because the separation has been amicable, he believes many of those schools will continue playing each other. ''We want our schools to play really good nonconference games,'' he said, ''whether its football or basketball, because that's how you rebuild your brand — prove it on the field.'' Aresco dismissed talk that the Big East might reconsider its postseason ban for Connecticut's men's basketball team, allowing the Huskies play in this year's Big East tournament. UConn was barred from the postseason by the NCAA because of previous low Academic Progress Rate scores, and the Big East followed suit. School officials have been lobbying against the ban, noting the team has improved those scores and no current players were involved in the previous problems. ''They've got a terrific APR now, they're doing much better,'' Aresco said. ''This is just one of those things. It happened, and it's something they're going to have to get through.''",Raw Data
146,"HOUSTON Much righteous indignation was expended over seven NFL head coaches being fired immediately after the regular season. I am saving my outrage for those who survived. It was those guys botching the start of the NFL playoffs on Saturday. Houston Texans coach Gary Kubiak and Bengals coach Marvin Lewis staged a clinic of coaching ineptitude in what amounted to The AFC Junior Varsity Game. Or as league purists like to call it, the wild-card game. Houston defeated Cincinnati, 19-13, an interesting set of numbers considering the Texans dominated every facet of this game except for punting. And in fairness, the guy from Cincy had way more practice. First downs: Texans 24, Bengals 12 Total yards: Texans 420, Bengals 198 Time of possession: Texans 38:49, Bengals 21:11 This list goes on and on and on and includes Kubiak schooling Lewis in what amounted to a fight to be the tallest short person. Lewis OK'd and watched as his offensive coordinator Jay Gruden inexplicably underused running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis and overused a screen play that worked exactly never. There was a misused timeout, a forgotten A.J. Green, a reliance on Jermaine Gresham and inability to adjust. And yet with under four minutes remaining, the Bengals were driving down the field for what possibly could have been the game-winning score. Why this happened was inadvertently explained by Texans linebacker Bradie James when talking their defensive strategy. ""The biggest thing, well, a lot of us have been trying to talk about it not giving up seven points. You see, when you give up seven points you don't have a chance,"" James said. ""But when you keep a team to just kicking field goals, you keep 'em close and then you can pin your ears back."" James needs to deliver this speech to Kubiak. To him or Texans owner Bob McNair or somebody, because the reverse is also true. Kubiak employs quite possibly the most conservative game plan in the NFL. If this was politics, he'd be labeled a wingnut and decried by Glenn Beck as having lost touch with mainstream values. The guy always looks to be in a state of panic about when he can get his kicker on the field. Heck, there was a moment Saturday when the Texans took a delay on fourth-and-short with their punter on the field. The idea of doing that with his offense probably never crossed his mind even though Arian Foster was lethal Saturday. It is why Texans fans boo kicker Shayne Graham every time he takes the field. It is not personal. They are sick of seeing him every single time there is a close call in the red zone. ""I love our crowd but they are getting spoiled,"" Texans running back Arian Foster said. ""They're booing, and we're OK. We're OK, man."" What is frustrating is the Texans could be a good team, at very least a competitive playoff team. As much as this pains me to say, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips has his side ballin'. He may be a cupcake as a head coach, but he's pretty good at coordinating. And J.J. Watt is just a freak of football nature. Kubiak's not beating the New England Patriots Sunday in Foxboro if he's not willing to gamble, open his game plan up just a bit and play to win. We already saw that game, the Texans going up to Foxboro in their matching letter jackets and talk of Bulls on Parade and clear hearts, full eyes can't lose . . . and getting pummeled. New England absolutely embarrassed Houston on Dec. 10, a 42-14 whipping that started a slide to end this season. Almost every Texans player downplayed that first meeting with the usual clichs about this being a different season, about short memories, about how this game will be closer. ""I don't think it was embarrassing. It just was a game and, on any given Sunday, if you don't show up, it can happen,"" James said. ""New England did teach us a lot. They taught us you need to show up and bring the intensity to be a champion."" This perspective comes from being in his 10th season, of knowing NFL teams do not get infinite kicks at the can, of knowing NFL teams oftentimes have to do a little impossible if they want to win a Super Bowl. ""I'm not worried,"" McNair said when asked about playing New England again, which felt like the exact wrong thing to say. He needs to worry because Tom Brady is not going to let the Texans off the mat if they keep constantly settling for field goals like the Bengals and QB Andy Dalton did. McNair needs to worry because Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has a firm grasp of how to best use his weapons, despite his critics. McNair needs to worry because Belichick is not going to Marvin Lewis this thing. Belichick coaches with a big set of lower guts. And he rarely beats himself. And if Kubiak coaches like he did Saturday, the Texans do not stand a chance. And in a couple of years or next, the pink slip may be his and there will be little outrage.",Raw Data

148,"﻿LANDOVER, Md. — There was a time when a game like Sunday would not have weighed so heavily on Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, when this 28-18 loss to the Redskins that ended the Cowboys' season and sent Washington the playoffs would have been explained away. This is the guy who, somewhat infamously, declared that “if this is the worst thing that ever happens to me, I will have lived a good life” after a season-ending loss to Philly a couple of year ago. There is a cumulative effect to failure, though, and Romo has been on the losing end of so many of these win-or-go-home games now that the scars have added up; have taken their toll. At least it looked that way as he slowly and gingerly walked to his locker late Sunday. This seemed like a quarterback finally broken by coming up short. “I feel as though I let our team down,” Romo said, referring to his late-game interception with the Cowboys down 21-18 and deep in their own territory. “We’ve done such a good job in those last 5-10 minutes, like I said, to win a lot of games and we were back in that position again. And that’s on me. And that is a very frustrating and very hard thing to think about because you want to be in that position. It’s just very hard to think about.” There are no curses in football. There is only a minimal amount of luck involved in final outcomes. It is the beauty and savagery of the game, it always strips you down to what you are. And what Sunday’s game revealed about Romo is he is what we thought he was, and that is not good enough. He certainly was not as good as his Redskins counterpart Robert Griffin III, a rookie who with one good leg has his team in the playoffs. There are reasons. There are always reasons — injuries, wrong routes run by receivers, wrong coach, wrong play calls, defensive failures, or just bad luck in Seattle. As former Cowboys coach Bill Parcells loved to say about other things but it is apropos here: He may not be the trouble but he is always there. We have seen some version of this schadenfreude dating back to the 2006 season, when Romo bobbled the snap for what would have been the game-winning field goal in a wild-card game in Seattle. Since then, the Cowboys and their QB have been chasing that moment when Romo goes from good to legendary, when he makes the play, when they win the game, when he reveals himself to be special. That is what the Redskins have finally happened upon in RG3. He is special, with special being determined in December and January, when the stakes are win or go home. The best teams in the league, the teams with legit playoff chances all have special quarterbacks — Denver with Manning, New England with Brady, Green Bay with Rodgers. And now Seattle and Washington with Wilson and RG3. It is always about the quarterback, and the Redskins have the better one. There was no moment of genius for RG3. If we are being honest, he struggled in parts. He was slowed by a balky knee and his game looked off. What he did not do was make mistakes. He gave his running back a chance, and Alfred Morris delivered in such a huge way, 200 yards on 33 carries and three touchdowns. Romo, in contrast, had three interceptions. He did this despite having more big-game experience. And, maybe, it was the cumulative impact of that experience and the scars they carry. There was a meme that started circulated before the game was even done of Romo just staring into nothingness on the bench as the Redskins ice the game. It looked very much like a guy wondering if he was ever going to do it. He said he does not. Does he worry about his legacy? “Your legacy will be written when you are done playing the game. When it’s over with, you will look back and talk about those things,” Romo said. “It’s disappointing not being able to get it done. . . . That is a tough pill to swallow especially when I throw that interception at the end.” When you are Robert Griffin III’s age, you have no idea how hard this is going to be. What we forget is Romo was once RG3, not as highly touted or drafted nearly as early (in fact, Romo went undrafted), but teeming with that much promise at one point. The Cowboys thought they had found their link to Staubach and Aikman. The Cowboys absolutely needed Romo to be special in this game. Their defense was broken, being held together by duct tape and a bunch of no-names. Their receiving corps lacked Dez Bryant and Miles Austin by the time the game was being decided. And yet there the Cowboys were with 3-1/2 minutes remaining and the ball at the 15-yard line. They trailed by only a field goal. Cowboys linebacker Anthony Spencer had delivered a sack, forcing a punt that had set them up. This was Romo’s chance to rewrite his story, to shake his “chokes in big games, big moments” label. It is what he has been doing all season, coming back, finding a way, leading this team to victory. He found Cowboys tight end Jason Witten for 14 yards. This was finally going to be the time. Then it happened. The Redskins were blitzing. Of course, they were blitzing. Romo saw the rusher break inside. He remembers thinking the safe throw was to running back DeMarco Murray on the sideline. Yes, the Redskins defender had peeled off. All Romo had to do was float the ball over his head. Instead Rob Jackson made an exceptional play. “I wish I had made a different decision,” Romo said, the regret thick on his tongue. This is not a curse. This is not luck. This is the difference in every game. Witten was right when he said “It does feel close but at the same time you have to be real about it. It’s a close league. It comes down to one or two or three plays in a game, in a season.” It is in those moments that the game strips a player down and reveals what they are. He is what he is. And that is not enough to win in this league.",Raw Data

But the ambitious Senegal striker is already thinking a whole lot bigger than that ahead of todays Fourth-Round replay with Brentford. He wants to win the Premier League AND the Champions League with Chelsea and sees no reason why it cant happen. Ba, 27, said: I havent won any trophies so far. I would like to see how it feels to win a trophy. I want to win the league and the Champions League as well. Chelsea won it last season, so why not do it again? Chelsea have already missed out on four trophies this season after losing in the Super Cup and Club World Cup finals. They also became the first holders to crash out in the Champions League group stage before Ba even arrived and then lost to Swansea in the Capital One Cup semi-finals. But Ba who could play in a face-mask against Brentford today after breaking his nose insists he will do everything he can to turn things around. He said: I gave everything to be where I am today. I just do my job and for a striker, the job is to help the team to win games by scoring goals first of all. Its not only about scoring goals but it helps the team when you do.",Raw Data
150,"One of the most disappointing tenures in announcing history is reportedly set to end with a whimper. Jason McIntyre at TBL has multiple sources inside ESPN that say the network will not renew Bob Knight's contract at the end of the college basketball season. Knight (sorry that's supposed to be Coach Knight or Mr. Knight) has been an ESPN college basketball analyst since 2008 and his departure from coaching. Initially, ESPN praised Knight's hiring as a ""compelling listen"" and hailed the former coach as a ""legend."" Knight could be a decent game analyst when he was engaged, but his wealth of knowledge and insight about the game never made it to viewers at home. The only thing that proved to be compelling about Knight's ESPN career was the controversy he created and the material he provided blogs. Knight's public, petulant feud with John Calipari and Kentucky reached ridiculous levels when the former coach wouldn't say the name of the eventual national champion last year. In fact, it was news when an ESPN college basketball analyst finally spoke the word ""Kentucky."" The mini-controversy exposed the absurd favorability and leeway ESPN provided Knight, who was able to play by his own set of rules. Knight's other notable moments as an ESPN broadcaster? I can think of three: 1) The time he swore on College Gameday. 2) The time he fell asleep on College Gameday. 3) The time he forgot what the shot clock was. And that's it. TBL even notes one source inside ESPN saying the network has gone as far as hiding Knight on unattractive games this season. Knight has mostly called SEC games this year on ESPN2, so there's certainly some legitimacy to that idea. Additionally, his presence across the ""family of networks"" has been diminished greatly since he had his own SportsCenter segments at the beginning of his analyst career. Knight's legacy as a broadcaster is one ESPN would rather forget. There couldn't have been many observers who imagined his notoriously irritable personality would translate well to television, but Bristol bent over backwards to bow down to the mystique of The General and his ESPN sweater. The mystique quickly faded as Knight never connected with viewers and he slowly moved out of the college basketball spotlight. It's another lesson that great coaches and players don't always make great analysts.",Raw Data

Fixtures involving Somerset at Bath have been a tradition for over 100 years but unfortunately the appalling weather during 2012 managed to achieve what only the event of two World Wars had previously accomplished; the cancellation of Somersets annual appearance in the city. This seasons match will see Somerset welcome Yorkshire to The Rec on Thursday, August in the YB40 competition. The first Bath Cricket Festival took place in 1897. As part of the event Somerset CCC hosted The Gentlemen of Philadelphia at The Recreation Ground. Despite 66 from Richard Palairet the match ended in a draw but the tone was set for what would become a cornerstone of Somersets history. Set against the beautiful backdrop of Baths iconic architecture, some of the biggest names in Somersets history have taken to the field to do battle. The likes of Gimblett, Botham, Richards, Caddick and Trescothick have all excelled within the glorious surroundings of this city that is steeped in such cultural and historical heritage. As this is a midweek fixture demand for hospitality packages will be extremely high and availability is limited. Anyone interested in hospitality for this match can contact Sam McIntyre on 01823-425323 or email samm@somersetcountycc.co.uk Somerset will also be heading south this summer to play a competitive fixture in Cornwall. As part of the Cornish Cricket Festival 2013, Somerset will play their away fixture against The Unicorns in the YB40 competition at Truro CC on Friday, June 14. This will be the first time that Somerset CCC have played a match in Cornwall since the two counties met in a T20 challenge match in August 2008.

152,"In 1984, Dan Marino, likely the greatest modern quarterback to never win a Super Bowl, passed for a then-record 48 touchdowns in the Dolphins' 14-2 campaign. (Associated Press) Yeah, the Harbaughs will be the media darlings. But don't sleep on these names come Super Bowl XLVII. Quarterback Tom Brady (12) passed for a record 50 touchdowns in 2007, the season his Patriots (lost in Super Bowl XLII) almost produced the first 19-0 campaign in NFL history. (Associated Press) With no pro football on the docket this week, here's an updated, numbers-based look at the Greatest Teams To Not Win The Super Bowl — a list that researches 47 NFL campaigns (1966-2012) and rewards regular-season record, per-game point differential, turnover margin, strength of schedule, divisional superiority, blowout victories (and any other bits of extra credit that may vault certain teams into the countdown). The one significant caveat: Only teams with 10 or more wins from 1966-77 (the NFL had a 14-game schedule) and 11 or more victories from 1978-2012 (16-game schedule) are considered. Below are the top 10 teams on the list. MORE: Who doesn't quite make the cut for the top 10? Nos. 20-11 | Nos. 40-21 10. 1990 Buffalo Bills Regular-season record: 13-3 Home: 8-0 ... Road: 5-3 The 1990 Bills ruled the AFC through fear — and with a devastating, quick-strike offense (league-high 428 points) that had no peer. Behind Hall of Famers Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith (sorry, Andre Reed — for now), the '90 Bills enjoyed a problem-free run to the East title and AFC championship, thumping the Dolphins and Raiders in the playoffs before suffering a gut-wrenching loss to the Giants in Super Bowl XXV. But that franchise-defining defeat — capped by kicker Scott Norwood's wide-right miss at the gun — doesn't obscure double-digit excellence in point differential and turnover margin, nine blowout victories or a 4-2 mark against playoff teams (including a 17-13 win over the Giants in December). Unfortunately, New York got its revenge in January. 9. 1984 Miami Dolphins Regular-season record: 14-2 Home: 7-1 ... Road: 7-1 The 1982 Dolphins reached Super Bowl XVII on the strength of a dominating defense, affectionately dubbed The Killer B's. But when Miami reached The Big Game two years later, it had seamlessly morphed into an offensive machine, coinciding with the emergence of WRs Mark Duper and Mark Clayton and QB Dan Marino, who would break new ground with 48 TD passes in 1984 (an NFL record that stood for 20 years). With Marino (the sixth QB taken in Round 1 of the heralded '83 draft) leading the charge, the '84 Fins were virtually unstoppable, notching 10 blowout victories and a sizable point differential (13.4). The only drawbacks: In Week 11, Miami suffered its first loss to an underwhelming San Diego club (in overtime); and in the AFC playoffs, the Dolphins were fortunate to avoid the defending champion Raiders (knocked out in the wild-card round). 8. 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers Regular-season record: 10-4 Home: 6-1 ... Road: 4-3 At the very least, the 1976 Steelers are the greatest team to start 1-4 in any NFL season. In their final nine regular-season games that year — all Pittsburgh victories — the famed Steel Curtain defense surrendered a total of 28 points (or 3.1 per game), a ferocious, awe-inspiring run that included three consecutive shutouts (an NFL record). In the playoffs, the Steelers demolished the Colts in Baltimore, 40-14, before bowing out to the eventual champion Raiders in the AFC title game, in part a consequence of playing without injured running backs Franco Harris and Rocky Bleier. Of course, this ranking comes with some controversy, as Pittsburgh lost to every playoff-bound foe during the regular season and was a pedestrian 4-3 away from Three Rivers Stadium. But for us, 'tis better to stay on Jack Lambert's good side. 7. 2010 New England Patriots Regular-season record: 14-2 Home: 8-0 ... Road: 6-2 Tom Brady has reached the Super Bowl five times in his career, but the 2010 Patriots might have been his most complete and balanced club over an 11-year period. Brady threw for 3,900 yards and 36 TDs (against only four INTs) and cruised to NFL MVP honors. Tailback BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushed for more than 1,000 yards and 13 TDs — while deftly sharing the running back load with Danny Woodhead, Fred Taylor, Sammy Morris and Kevin Faulk. Pass-catchers Wes Welker, Deion Branch, Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez each finished with at least 500 yards and five touchdowns receiving. And the typically bland New England defense allowed only 313 points — with seven or fewer points allowed in four of its last five regular-season games. But the true greatness of the 14-2 season lies with Brady, who led the Patriots to 30-plus points in the final eight regular-season games. 6. 1969 Minnesota Vikings Regular-season record: 12-2 Home: 7-0 ... Road: 5-2 The 1969 Vikings achieved the rare triple crown of leading the NFL in points scored (379), points allowed (133) and per-game point differential (17.6). Throw in nine blowout victories, a perfect mark against 1969 playoff teams and three outings of 50-plus points — and we're talking about one of the greatest regular seasons in league history. But just like the 1968 Colts, the '69 Vikings forever will be stained by a Super Bowl loss to a seemingly inferior team (Kansas City) from a seemingly inferior league (AFL); and while the Chiefs get full props for taking down the Vikings when it mattered most — 65 Toss Power Trap, anyone? — it's important to include one gut-wrenching footnote: In Week 1 of the 1970 season — the first official year of the NFL-AFL merger — Minnesota exacted some revenge on Kansas City, rolling to an emotionally charged 27-10 home victory. 5. 2011 Green Bay Packers Regular-season record: 15-1 Home: 8-0 ... Road: 7-1 The No. 5 ranking seems great — until you realize that heading into December 2011, many pundits were hailing Green Bay as a viable candidate to go 19-0 and assume the mantle of Greatest Team in NFL History. But a Week 15 loss to the lowly Chiefs and divisional-playoff home defeat to the Giants quickly softened the perception of these Packers, an offensive juggernaut but mere mortals on the defensive end. Still, what's not to love about 560 regular-season points (just shy of the 2007 Patriots' record of 589), 11 games of 30 or more points, a stellar turnover differential (+24) and a sterling 6-0 mark against 2011 playoff clubs? Of course, that unblemished status doesn't include the devastating postseason loss to the Giants, but the Packers aren't the first dominant team to be unhinged by New York in the playoffs. 4. 1998 Minnesota Vikings Regular-season record: 15-1 Home: 8-0 ... Road: 7-1 The Vikings were a certifiable powerhouse in that 1998 season, amassing a then-NFL record 556 points (predating the '07 Patriots), registering 12 blowout wins and dismantling the opposition by 16.2 points per game. (This explosion coincided with WR Randy Moss's NFL rookie season: 69 catches, 1,313 yards and 17 TDs.) Of equal relevance, the offense didn't supremely click until after backup QB Randall Cunningham (3,704 yards passing, 35 total TDs) took over in Week 3 (because of Brad Johnson's injury). Of course, Minnesota 's championship hopes were dashed by Atlanta in the NFC title game — remember Gary Anderson's only missed field goal in a two-year span? — precluding a titanic clash with the eventual champion Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII (John Elway's triumphant swan song). 3. 1983 Washington Redskins Regular-season record: 14-2 Home: 7-1 ... Road: 7-1 From a regular-season perspective, the 1983 Redskins trump nearly all comers in this countdown — even the high-powered Vikings of 1998. The only thing preventing a No. 2 ranking is quite obvious: It's hard to get routed 38-9 in Super Bowl XVIII (to the Raiders) and expect glowing recollections from everyone in the NFL universe. Looking at the numbers, Minnesota has a better overall record, more points scored and one additional blowout victory. But the Redskins, led by QB Joe Theismann, John Riggins, Art Monk, rookie Darrell Green and head coach Joe Gibbs, prevail in the end, thanks to an eye-popping turnover margin (+43), a 5-1 mark versus playoff teams (including a win over the eventual champion Raiders in October), two one-point losses and an actual Super Bowl appearance. There's also this consolation prize: The 1983 Redskins are the greatest defending Super Bowl champs to not repeat the following season. 2. 1968 Baltimore Colts Regular-season record: 13-1 Home: 6-1 ... Road: 7-0 We could break down the Colts' Super Bowl III loss to the Jets in numerous ways, but it's more fun to wonder how NFL history might have been written if Baltimore had not been party to the most storied upset of all time. Something like ... 1) The AFL never earns the premerger respect of the NFL. 2) Coach Don Shula never feuds with Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom and ends up leaving Baltimore for the still-in-expansion-mode Dolphins in 1970. 3) Newly minted celebrity QB Joe Namath never gets the chance to visit Bobby Brady, on his phony death bed, in a campy-but-memorable episode of TV's ""The Brady Bunch."" 4) Even worse, Namath never inks a landmark deal to endorse pantyhose for Beauty Mist in the mid-70s. 1. 2007 New England Patriots Regular-season record: 16-0 Home: 8-0 ... Road: 8-0 The Patriots' perfect regular season in 2007 was more than just an unblemished record; it was an across-the-board reckoning for a club that genuinely wanted to win every game 45-7, no exceptions. How else should one reconcile otherworldly production in point differential (19.7), turnover margin (+16) and wins by 10 points of more (12) and a 6-0 mark against playoff teams — including three division winners? But alas, there's a fine line between being universally hailed as the greatest club in NFL history (on the precipice of 19-0) — and begrudgingly accepting one writer's award for Best Team To Not Win A Super Bowl. It's a consequence from the ultimate bittersweet season. On the positive side, Tom Brady set an NFL record with 50 touchdown passes, with Randy Moss also collecting an NFL-record 23 TD receptions. And realistically speaking, only the Ravens and Giants had fourth-quarter opportunities to spoil the Patriots' run of perfection during the regular season — a stunning achievement in a parity-driven era. But a loss in Super Bowl XLII downgrades New England's once-in-a-generation dominance from September-December to a simple footnote in NFL history. MORE: Who doesn't quite make the cut for the top 10?

154,"Rob Howley has identified the twin targets of discipline and momentum when Wales look to remain in RBS 6 Nations title contention on Saturday. The reigning Six Nations champions head to Rome for an appointment with Italy, who are likely to go into battle without their mercurial captain Sergio Parisse. The Stade Francais star faces a disciplinary hearing in Paris tomorrow after being sent off for allegedly insulting referee Laurent Cardona during a league game against Bordeaux-Begles last weekend. Parisse has denied any wrongdoing, but an anticipated minimum ban of six weeks would rule him out of Italys remaining Six Nations appointments this season against Wales, England and Ireland. Interim Wales boss Howley, though, has no doubt the Azzurri Six Nations conquerors of Wales in 2003 and 2007 will once again provide difficult, testing opposition. It is one of the toughest places to go in Europe, said Howley, who confirmed lock Alun-Wyn Jones and flanker Sam Warburton as changes on the bench following Wales 16-6 victory over France in Paris earlier this month. I think they have got a great set-piece, and it is important we stop them at source and impact the game on what we want to bring to the 80 minutes. Weve always had a tough outing against Italy, home or away. They are very difficult to break down, they are very well organised, theyve got some world-class players and they are coached very well. It is a good challenge for us. On the back of winning in France, we realise that one win isnt good enough. It is about some momentum, and we need to go out there and beat Italy. The key for the weekend is discipline. It is the one thing we will talk about between now and then. Warburton, Wales 2011 World Cup captain who led them to Six Nations title and Grand Slam glory last season, missed the Stade de France encounter because of a shoulder injury. His fellow back-row forward Ryan Jones took over as skipper, with Justin Tipuric wearing the number seven shirt for a game that saw Wales claim their first victory in Paris since 2005. Howley gave his Paris heroes a resounding vote of confidence by naming an unchanged team seven days ago, and Warburton will be joined on the bench by Ospreys forward Jones, who suffered a shoulder injury during the Millennium Stadium defeat against Argentina three months ago and subsequently underwent surgery. He was called into Wales Six Nations squad last week and has made a couple of comeback appearances for the Ospreys, confirming his fitness. Watch the video for all the highlights from the press conference with Howley and Ryan Jones Cardiff Blues lock Lou Reed and Scarlets flanker Aaron Shingler drop out of the match-day 23 on duty against France, with Howleys bench contingent boasting a total of 264 caps. With Alun-Wyn and Sam on the bench, that experience and impact is so important, Howley added. The last 20-25 minutes in games are key, and having their experience is a priceless commodity. I am sure they will have a huge impact on the weekend. Sam is fully fit, hes taken an active part in training, and its great to have that experience. International rugby is about 23 players. Sam will go on to play many games for Wales and captain Wales. He is the ultimate professional. He is very grounded, and he understands regarding the decision that it was the best for the team. He has been fantastic in training, and he is obviously looking forward to making a difference when he goes on. Ryan Jones underlined the benefits of Howleys early team announcement as he prepares to make his 31st Test appearance as Wales skipper, an ongoing record. That extra time affords you to cover off things that get left to the last minute in a Test week. One of the toughest things about Test rugby is the lack of good preparation, he said. You only ever have three, possibly four sessions, as a team together, if you are lucky, so with a bit of luck we will be a little bit more prepared. The group of guys came back from France with their heads held high, and it is important to harness it. We know what is required it is a championship and it is one game at a time. We know what the challenge is on Saturday. Weve had some pretty tough encounters over the years against Italy. The challenge is to start like we finished against Ireland and France and really set out our stall early on.",Raw Data

157,"One reason the Lakers and Phil Jackson worked so well together is that they looked at the world the same way: gazing down their nose at it. It always seemed that the high chair Jackson was perched upon on the Lakers' bench, ostensibly to comfort his ailing hips, was a perfect metaphor. It was less a seat than a throne, a symbol of basketball royalty. It was in keeping with a franchise for whom its front-row celebrities, its outrageous fortune in acquiring talent and (oh, yes) its 16 titles always seemed to be shouting out the same chorus: We are the Lakers and you are not. And in case anyone needed a reminder, lo and behold, injured guard Steve Blake made it to a doctor's appointment Monday by catching a lift with Kobe Bryant . . . in his helicopter. Is this how it works in Milwaukee? The Lakers will find out soon enough if this is how it works with Mike D'Antoni, whom they shockingly hired late Sunday night instead of Jackson, who had led the franchise to five titles since 2000. There did not appear to be anyone outside the Lakers' front office who did not believe that Jackson was a lock for the job after he was interviewed by vice president Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak, after fans at Staples Center chanted ""We want Phil,"" after Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson were giddy about the prospects of a reunification. ""Sure I did,"" D'Antoni told New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica. ""For sure, I did. Didn't everybody? When I got the call that it was me, my first reaction was, 'Are you serious?'"" In many respects, D'Antoni is the anti-Jackson: self-deprecating, folksy, thin-skinned — just ask him about his teams' defense, or lack of it — and not coming across as more invested in his paycheck than he is in coaching the team. The Lakers will pay D'Antoni $12 million over the next three years — the same amount they paid Jackson when he last won a title in 2010 (and less than Brown earned) — to develop a Showtime-like offense like the one he orchestrated in Phoenix, with Steve Nash at the helm. How that system, which is predicated on ball movement and spacing, will play with a star-studded but less-than-energetic roster with three players (Bryant, Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol) who prefer to be in the post is an immediate question. So, too, will be how much D'Antoni learned from his less-than-pleasant experience in New York where he suffered through two years of salary cap deconstruction only to have Carmelo Anthony and his ball-stopping ways foisted upon him. While Nash is certainly elated to be working again with D'Antoni, and Bryant, who has known the coach from his days growing up in Italy, has endorsed the move, the one who has the most to gain — or lose — is Howard, who could be devastating on the pick-and-roll with Nash and an anchor to their defense. Though Howard said that he was not consulted on the hiring, it is hard to believe that owner Jerry Buss or his son, Jim, did not make the move with an eye on what it would mean to Howard, who will be a free agent next summer. D'Antoni, 61, seems much more likely to be around for the duration of Howard's next contract— provided he wins. And while Howard would have fit nicely in the triangle offense that Jackson runs, it would have been another step along the path of Shaquille O'Neal. First, Orlando. Then the Lakers. And now Jackson? That would be another comparison with O'Neal that Howard has increasingly — and understandably — tried to run from. (O'Neal took another jibe at Howard recently, calling the Clippers' DeAndre Jordan the best center in the Western Conference — no word yet on whether he has asserted that pigs can also fly.) Ultimately, his relationship with Howard will be the one that D'Antoni must cultivate the most. Because in the end, just as Howard is trying to run from O'Neal, D'Antoni is sure to be followed by the shadow of Jackson. If you buy the version of the Lakers' coaching search — the one that everybody involved is backpedaling from — that Jackson severely overplayed his hand by asking for an obscene amount of money, control over personnel decisions, and relief from a schedule that might be strenuous for a 67-year-old with bad knees, artificial hips and a fused spine, then the rest of this season (and perhaps beyond) will be colored by this account. Attached to each loss, each bit of stunted development, and each step that ultimately stands between the Lakers and an NBA title will be a price tag that the Lakers were not willing to pay and a simple question: What would Phil have done? It is not necessarily fair to D’Antoni, but it is the price of being royalty, where the opportunity is as great as the expectations and the world view is taken in looking down one’s nose.",Raw Data

159,"America’s most dominant athlete isn’t LeBron James or Floyd Mayweather. It’s not Serena Williams and her 30 Grand Slam titles, not Tom Brady and his three Super Bowl wins, not Kobe Bryant and his five NBA rings. No, right now, America’s single most dominant athlete is standing in the bowels of the basketball arena at Baylor University, her size-17 men’s basketball shoes tucked under her arm. There are two things you’ll notice about Brittney Griner when you meet her: She’s tall, very tall, 6-foot-8 with impossibly long arms that give her a wingspan of 7-foot-4. And she’s a kind-hearted, fun-loving kid who likes to listen to electronic music like Skrillex and has a soft spot for extreme sports. Her face contorts into an expression of empathy for the plight of misunderstood reptiles. (She has a year-old albino corn snake named Sage as a pet, and she thinks the slithery things get an unfair rep.) And when she thinks about the past year, she giggles at the craziness of it all, as she’s grown from a really tall girl who likes to hoop into the most transcendent athlete to ever play her sport. Brittney Griner is much more than just a young lady who occasionally dunks a basketball. After last season’s Baylor women’s team went 40-0 on its way to a national championship, and as this year’s one-loss Baylor team is ranked No. 1 and seems primed to repeat as the nation’s best, Griner has become nothing short of a phenomenon. At road games, she wades through flocks of hundreds of fans who chant her name; many of them are basketball-playing girls looking for a role model and hoping to catch a glimpse of Griner, maybe even touch her. She has met LeBron, one of her idols. She can’t even make a late-night trip to Walmart without having to pause for a few photos with fans. She’s a 22-year-old college student who is grappling with the realities of fame even as she just tries to blend right in as a regular girl. Fat chance that will ever happen. ""In the road for the first conference game this year, during shootarounds they’d scream my name, yell my name, and I’m used to that,” Griner said. “But after the game, it was like a whole new world. I really felt like a rock star, walking to the bus. A wave of people just came running. A second wave of people just kept coming. They were chanting my name. ""On the men’s side, you see it all the time. For it to be on the women’s side of the game, it just shows how much the game’s grown, how much people really love to watch a girl play ball."" It’s a nice and humble thought, that what Griner is experiencing is a reflection of a bigger movement of interest toward women’s basketball. At some schools, it’s true. Tennessee and Louisville’s women’s team each averaged more than 10,000 fans per home game last year, with Iowa State nearly breaking the 10,000-per-game mark. (As a comparison, 40 men’s teams averaged more than 10,000 fans at home games last season, and four teams topped 20,000.) But the truth is, Griner is more a singular force than a reflection of a greater movement, the first time a women’s basketball player has ever combined extraordinary height with extraordinary coordination and athletic ability. Through 19 games this season, she is averaging 21.5 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.5 blocks. “What it reminds me of is back in the day when you saw Elvis Presley coming on stage, and all those little groupie women screaming and hollering and wanting to touch him and falling down,” Baylor basketball coach Kim Mulkey said. “Think about the women’s game. Brittney’s the first player I’ve ever witnessed that is like Brittney. We’ve seen tall women. We’ve seen women that dunk it. And we’ve seen great players, dominant players. But Brittney is just unique. I don’t know if we’ll ever see another one who can impact the game on both ends of the floor like she has.” All that was on full display at a recent Big 12 home game against West Virginia, played before a near-sellout crowd. West Virginia didn’t avoid bringing the ball into the paint like most other teams do when they play against Baylor, and Griner took full advantage. A minute into the game, Griner had her first block, of a jumper near the free-throw line. She grabbed the ball and dribbled the rest of the court for a layup. Throughout the game, West Virginia kept two players on Griner whether she had the ball or not. But over and over, Griner would get a lob near the paint, then do her Tim Duncan-esque 5-foot turnaround jumper off the glass. It would go in every time. By the end of the game, which Baylor won 76-58, Griner thought she had a so-so performance. The stats would tell a different story: 26 points, 15 rebounds and nine blocks, which was one block short of a triple-double and brought her to 12 blocked shots short of the NCAA career record. She set that blocked-shots mark two games later — in Saturday's 82-65 victory over 20th-ranked Oklahoma — giving her a total of 665. Louella Tomlinson, who played for Saint Mary's from 2007-11, was the previous record holder. Even when she doesn’t feel like she’s dominating a game, she does, her mere presence changing the complexion of how an opponent plays. ""Some shots you normally take, you just don’t do it with her there,” said West Virginia guard Christal Caldwell. “Shots you normally take in the paint, you can’t. You gotta move backwards. And she’s still there.” What’s next for Griner? A second NCAA title, hopefully. A career in the WNBA, obviously. A growing penchant for sports like mountain biking that will continue to drive her coaches nuts. (A month after last year’s Final Four, Griner broke her wrist when she was long-boarding down a Baylor parking garage.) And, if she has it her way, a legacy that looks past the novelty of Brittney Griner, The Tall Girl Who Dunked, and looks at how remarkable she has become on the basketball court: someone who can rebound, can push the pace up the floor, can even knock down 3-pointers when her coach lets her. ""'She was so much more than dunking,'” Griner said. “Oh, God. I want you to write that: 'I’m so much more than dunking.' I actually work on other parts of my game. I just want down the road for younger players to look at me and say, 'I can take that path.' I don’t want to be a flop or a mess-up.” It was time for practice before the next night’s game. Griner took her hulking shoes out from under her arms and skipped out toward the court. She paused a moment and turned back. ""I’ll try and throw one down for you,” she said. Then she turned and ran off. Follow Reid Forgrave on Twitter @ReidForgrave or email him at ReidForgrave@gmail.com.",Raw Data
160,"Namely, it occurs just before Christmas, when the next round of games won’t actually be played until the middle of February and early March. It leaves one longing for the juiciest long-since announced matchups as the tournament begins in earnest, after the wheat was ruthlessly separated from the chaff in the group stage. To wit, this year’s — or next year’s, rather — first knockout round, contested over two games spread over each team’s home ground, will yield a threesome of high-profile clashes and a smattering of equally interesting, if less star-studded ones. Arsenal will play Bayern Munich. AC Milan faces Barcelona. And Real Madrid will measure itself against fellow global soccer colossus Manchester United. Because such were the names paired to each other at random by the little blue balls — which paired a group winner with a runner-up in each instance — snatched from the bowls by a few members of the soccer noblesse in Nyon, Switzerland, early Thursday morning in a ceremony refreshingly lacking the fuss that usually envelops UEFA or FIFA events. Also paired together were Galatasaray and Schalke 04; Celtic and Juventus; Valencia and Paris Saint-Germain; FC Porto and Malaga; and, most intriguingly, Borussia Dortmund and Shakhtar Donetsk. The draw is done, the stage is set. Find out what to expect in the Champions League knockout round. The first legs will be played February 12-13 and February 19-20. The second legs will follow on March 5-6 and March 12-13. All of the games will be available across the FOX Soccer family of networks. On March 15, a draw will take place to fill out the remainder of the knockout-round bracket. But first, there is this season’s Round of 16 to tend to, and it promises fireworks not often seen so early in the tournament. Arsenal is desperate for some traction in this, its eighth season since winning a major trophy, but it drew elite opposition for the Round of 16 for a third year in a row — having fallen to AC Milan last year and Barcelona the year prior. That opponent, Bayern Munich, was arguably the strongest side of this tournament over the 2012 calendar year. Bayern only lost last season’s final to Chelsea on penalties in spite of being the superior team. It demolished its group-stage opponents this season, and will look to get over the hump. AC Milan was handed perhaps the toughest assignment. For the cash-strapped club, which no longer can build on the caliber of talent on which it forged its name and won this competition seven times, vanquishing any opponent remaining in the field is a big ask. But none more so than Barca, which won the big-eared cup in 2006, 2009 and 2011 with a largely unchanged core that looks as strong as ever this year. Barca, however, is in an unusual sort of turmoil for a soccer team. It is, for now, without its head coach Tito Vilanova, who has been diagnosed with cancer for a second time and its talismanic left back Eric Abidal, who is recovering from a transplant of his liver, on which a tumor was discovered. Check the best images from the Champions League's last group stage round. Manchester United will have to solve a challenge of a different matter. More than any other team remaining in this tournament, it is battling on two fronts. United has built a six-point lead in the Premier League but will need to exert every bit of its talent and energy to maintaining it in the most treacherous and even of leagues. Thereafter, it will sink whatever resources that remain disposable into taking down Real Madrid. Madrid, which is the record nine-time winner, will want to win this tournament badly, given that it’s practically out of the domestic league race already, having stumbled too often early on in the season. With manager Jose Mourinho seemingly on the outs after the season is over and the drought of European trophies now extending to 13 years, Madrid will be fixated on winning it — especially after losing to Bayern in last year’s semis on penalties. In the other matchups, two of the tournament’s three overachievers were handed winnable ties, while one was not. Galatasaray, which has played a refreshing up-tempo game, should be capable of overcoming Schalke 04, whose sporting crisis is such that manager Huub Stevens was fired this week. Malaga, the game’s nouveaux-riches-then-nouveaux-pauvres, dazzled with its cobbled-together-on-a-shoestring side in the opening round. It should best FC Porto, which may be Europe’s best scout and developer of talent but seems to have bled too much of it of late to compete this year. Celtic, the tournament’s fall sensation, was unlucky in being cast in with Juventus, the resurgent Italian giant that finally looks fully recovered from the Calciopoli scandal that saw them ruined and relegated in 2006. Who will join Messi in 2012's best XI? Review FOX Soccer's list. Also intriguing is the affair between Valencia, which continues to amaze with its ability to find jewels on the scrapheap and make its island of misfits harmonious, and Paris Saint-Germain, which does the opposite, buying up only the game’s rich and famous. The Parisians hope to prove that you can, in fact, win continentally immediately after buying a team together whole cloth, something never achieved in less than five years. But the real hidden gem of the Round of 16 is Dortmund vs. Shakhtar, featuring two of the more fluid and exciting teams in European soccer. Dortmund, painstakingly constructed from within, has managed to hold off the much richer Bayern to win the past two German league titles with a pleasingly attacking style. It also won Group D — or the Group of Death, so dubbed — and was the only team undefeated in it. Shakhtar’s success is largely underpinned by a small army of mobile Brazilian playmakers, who orchestrate their own run-and-gun style and helped the club get the second spot in Group E, knocking out defending champion Chelsea. And now, the appetite thoroughly whetted, there remains nothing to do but wait. For almost two months . . .

161,"Link to video: Benitez defends Torres after Chelsea scrape through in Europa League Rafael Benítez launched a defence of Fernando Torres's spluttering form after Chelsea squeezed beyond Sparta Prague and into the last 16 of the Europa League courtesy of Eden Hazard's stoppage-time equaliser. The Belgian substitute's 92nd-minute goal set up a tie with Steaua Bucharest next month and spared Benítez's side an awkward period of extra-time, with Sunday's trip to Manchester City in mind. The European champions had created enough chances to prevail, though their profligacy, not least that of Torres, had left the tie on edge until the end. The interim first-team manager delivered a show of support for his compatriot in the aftermath despite Torres now having scored only once, against Brentford of League One, in 14 games stretching back before Christmas. ""We could be talking about Fernando not scoring goals and him having had four chances but let's turn it into a positive: he had those four chances,"" said Benítez. ""I've seen him in games not having these chances because he's not in the right position. But this wasn't a situation where the striker disappeared. He was in the right place at the right time. ""The goalkeeper stopped him, and he missed some chances. Are we disappointed he didn't score? Yes, we are. But he was still giving his all to the team. He's playing better. He didn't play badly tonight. You can analyse a striker purely on the number of goals he scores – maybe you're right – but he did a great job for the team. It's not easy against a team playing so deep, but he won the ball in the air, brought options for those around him. I thought he played well. If he continues working like today and playing like he did today, he will score goals. I'm convinced about that."" Benítez pointed to Chelsea having 22 shots on goal and enjoying 60% of the possession but he conceded he had been anxious as the seconds ticked down and extra-time loomed large before his substitute saved the day. Sparta had time only to kick-off from the restart before the Macedonian official blew for full-time. The home side's captain, John Terry, still admitted frustration at the team's inability to impose themselves earlier on the tie. ""It wasn't our best performance and the way we started was disappointing,"" he said. ""We left it as late as we could, as sometimes that's the best way, but we're in the next round and we're happy with that. We've kept going and going and going. The first 80 minutes nothing went for us. We had a lot of attempts on goal but it didn't go for us. But the persistence from the lads was fantastic. We're still very disappointed to be out of the Champions League and watching that on Tuesday and Wednesday nights is frustrating but this is a good competition and we're in it to win it.""",Raw Data

""Initial scans showed that it was only a dislocation but the scans were sent to Australia for further opinion,"" Sri Lanka team manager Michael de Zoysa said. ""The opinion from Australia is that Mahela will have to undergo surgery and have a wire inserted to keep the dislocated bone in place. ""He will be out for between four-to-six weeks which means he is certainly ruled out of the Bangladesh Test series."" Thilan Samaraweera would replace Jayawardene for the two Tests against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement.

164,"A master at playing to his audience, Djokovic came with several boxes of chocolates to his post-match news conference and then played host as he distributed them to a room packed with journalists. Novak Djokovic got the better of rival Andy Murray this time, winning the 2013 Australian Open men's final. See the photos. ''Please, take two,'' Djokovic said, offering his box of treats to one reporter at a time. ''I see nobody's on a sugar free diet,'' he joked as the chocolates began to disappear. The No. 1-ranked player became the first man in the Open era to win three consecutive Australian titles when he beat Andy Murray 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-2 in Sunday's final. Djokovic has won four of his six major titles at Melbourne Park, and likes to give a little something back to the crowds who cheer him on. An entertainer on court and off, Djokovic is known for celebrating hard-fought victories at Rod Laver Arena by ripping off his shirt. He kept his clothes on for this final, but did bare his chest after winning a five-hour thriller over Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round. ''It's definitely my favorite Grand Slam,'' Djokovic said during his victory speech on center court. ''It's an incredible feeling winning this trophy once more. I love this court.'' To mark the national holiday on Saturday, Djokovic pinned a fuzzy koala to his sweat shirt and walked into his pre-final news conference saying, ''Happy Australia Day!'' He was asked on Sunday if his good humor was a conscious effort, which made Djokovic turn philosophical. ''I try to enjoy what I do, and every moment of the life that I have is a blessing,'' he said. ''What else can you do but to be happy and try to bring that joy to the other people around - especially in the tournaments.'' ''Everybody has bad days, I'm not always funny or laughing,'' he added. He then apologized to reporters for canceling the winner's traditional day-after news conference scheduled for Monday but said he wanted to get back to Europe to begin practicing for the Davis Cup which starts next weekend. That's when he brought out the chocolates, as a consolation prize. ''Let's keep it sweet,'' he said. TRIBUTE TO ANDRE: Andre Agassi made his return to Rod Laver Arena in a suit and tie. Now 42, Agassi was invited back to the site of some of his greatest tennis triumphs to present this year's trophies. ''It was obviously a big pleasure and honor for me to receive the trophy from him,'' Djokovic said. By winning his fourth Australian Open, Djokovic matched a record set by Agassi who won the tournament in 1995, 2000, `01 and `03. ''He's a legend of the sport,'' said Djokovic. ''He won everything.'' An eight-time Grand Slam winner, Agassi won at each of the four Grand Slams and owns an Olympic gold medal from the 1996 Atlanta Games. Agassi watched the final from the stands and then presided over the trophy ceremony. It was his first trip Down Under in nearly 10 years. MIXED DOUBLES: It all started with a long-distance text message. Australia's Matthew Ebden picked up his phone and sent a message to Jarmila Gajdosova to see if she would play mixed doubles with him at the Australian Open. ''I got hold of her number from a secret person, and she was over in America,'' said the 25-year-old Ebden. ''And I just texted her hoping that she would she would be available to play or wanted to play.'' She said yes and they won a wild-card entry to the mixed doubles draw. On Sunday, the Australian duo combined to win the mixed doubles title with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Czech pair Lucie Hradecka and Frantisek Cermak. They ousted second-seeded Elena Vesnina and Leander Paes in the second round and fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova and Mahesh Bhupathi in the quarterfinals. Gajdosova praised her partner's strong serve and ''his Ninja skills on the net.'' Asked if they plan to play together in the future, Gajdosova said: ''Hopefully he doesn't ditch me for somebody else.'' ''No,'' Ebden said. ''I've already signed her up for next year.''",Raw Data

167,"With the score tied and time running out, Cobbs drained a long jump shot with 0.7 seconds left to send California past No. 23 Oregon 48-46 on Thursday night. The shot, which came after the Golden Bears (17-9, 9-5 Pac-12) ran nearly all of the final 26 seconds off the clock, hit nothing but net. ''Pure as the driven snow,'' Cal coach Mike Montgomery said. The shot was bit of redemption for Cobbs, who had a team-high 14 points to go with eight rebounds and seven assists. But the junior guard also had a team-high eight turnovers. But with the game on the line, he asked for the ball. ''Just the whole game I felt like I had a lot of mental lapses and I owed it to my team,'' Cobbs said. ''I've been working on my jump shot a lot and I knew if I got the ball in the right spot I'd be able to knock it down.'' Allen Crabbe, the Pac-12's leading scorer, had 12 points on 5-of-12 shooting. Richard Solomon also had eight points and 11 rebounds. Arsalan Kazemi had 11 points and a season-high 18 rebounds for the Ducks (21-6, 10-4), who lost their 11th straight game to the Bears. Carlos Emory scored 13 points for Oregon, which hasn't beaten Cal since Feb. 9, 2008. Oregon lost sole possession of first place in the Pac-12 with the loss. The Ducks are tied with Arizona. Cal, meanwhile, continued its climb up the rankings with its sixth win in seven games. The Bears are tied with Arizona State for third place, one game behind the Ducks and Wildcats. ''The last game against California, I told Coach I let him down, I didn't play my best,'' said Kazemi, who had 10 points and six rebounds in a 58-54 loss to Cal three weeks ago. ''And it really hurts right now sitting here and not winning this game.'' The Ducks' season-low 27.6 percent shooting led to a season low in points. Oregon was 16 for 58 from the field, 2 for 15 from 3-point range and 12 for 20 from the free throw line. ''That's really a disappointing loss,'' said Oregon coach Dana Altman, who was going for his 600th career win. ''The guys played awfully hard, but you got to hit some shots. We had some open looks and didn't knock them down.'' Oregon, which led 26-21 at halftime, was up 46-43 with 2:06 to play when Robert Thurman recorded a three-point play for Cal on a dunk and free throw to tie it. Oregon had possession with under a minute to play but missed on two shots before Cal got the rebound and called a timeout with 26.3 seconds left. In the huddle, Cobbs asked for the final shot. ''He wanted it, he felt it, he said, `Give me the ball. Give me the ball,''' Montgomery said. ''He made that shot. It was fabulous.'' Cal trailed by 11 points in the first half but came back to tie the score 29-29 on a dunk by Thurman 4 minutes into the second half. Oregon went back up 37-33 on a free throw and 3-pointer by E.J.

Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert's duo of Distracting and Pink Lollipops finished fourth and seventh, respectively. Teddy's Promise drew the No. 4 post, forcing Espinoza to move her outside, where she prefers to run. ''There were two horses in front of me, and I just tracked them,'' he said. ''At the three-eighths pole, I kind of just let her do her own thing. And turning for home, I just let her run.''

''She's really starting to relax and mature mentally. Physically, she's always been quite a specimen, but mentally, she's really turned a corner for us.'' Teddy's Promise was coming off a 5-1/4-length win in the Kalookan Queen Stakes as the 3-2 favorite on Dec. 29 at Santa Anita. ''That last race kind of got her a lot of confidence,'' Ellis said. ''I certainly don't think the mud hurts her. Her last one was on a little bit of a wet track. This was a muddier track today, but she won a Grade 1 on a fast track, so I think here at Santa Anita on the regular dirt it's a little bit better fit.'' Baffert's day wasn't a total wash. His horse, Fiftyshadesofhay, won the $100,000 Santa Ysabel Stakes for 3-year-old fillies by 5-3/4 lengths. Fiftyshadesofhay under Rafael Bejarano ran 1-1/16 miles in 1:42.89. She paid $14.40 as the 6-1 fourth choice in the field of five. Heir Kitty finished second for the second straight race. Scarlet Strike was another 1-1/2 lengths back in third as the 3-2 favorite. Fiftyshadesofhay finished eighth in the mile Blue Norther Stakes on the turf at Santa Anita on Jan. 1, an experiment Baffert labeled ''kind of disastrous.'' ''She can run all day long. She's fast, and she wants to be out there,'' he said. ''We were very high on her early in the year, and it's taken her a while to come around. But she ran like she's supposed to. She didn't like the turf.'' Scarlet Strike, who lost by a nose in the Blue Norther, has been no worse than third in eight career starts.

Newey, with Red Bull since 2006, said: Ive always maintained I do not want to spend my entire career in motor racing and certainly not F1  but right now I am enjoying it. And as long as that is the case and people offer me work, then Ill keep doing it. At this team we keep egos and politics to a minimum and try to keep an atmosphere where theres no finger-pointing. We encourage creativity.

He said: You need to feel happy in the team youre in and it is essential to have a competitive car. Right now I have them both. This is where Adrian is so brilliant. He gives me confidence and he designs world-beating cars. It is an incredible experience to work with him. The recordbuster, said to be about to extend his Red Bull contract, added: I think we can do even better.",Raw Data
173,"Matt Smith's early opener was cancelled out by Luis Suarez but a howler by Reds goalkeeper Brad Jones allowed Smith to restore Oldham's lead on the stroke of half-time. Reece Wabara powerfully headed in a third for the League One club and, even though Joe Allen reduced Liverpool's arrears with a deflected volley, Oldham clung on to seal a famous win. Smith gave indication of his threat in just the third minute with the sort of goal you associate with a player of his physical stature. Youssouf M'Changama swung over a cross from the left and the 23-year-old used every inch of his 6ft 6in frame to out-muscle Sebastian Coates and head past Jones. The first half had an edge to it as Raheem Sterling was booked for challenge on M'Changama which ultimately forced the Oldham midfielder off after just 10 minutes. Robbie Simpson, a scorer at Anfield in Oldham's 5-1 third-round defeat last season, was also cautioned for going in on Jones after the goalkeeper had failed to hold the ball - which turned out to be a pre-cursor of what was to come. Suarez, captaining on the day, brought Liverpool level in the 17th minute when he set off on a driving run from deep and looked to pass but got a lucky rebound off defender Cliff Byrne and reacted quickly to hammer the ball inside Dean Bouzanis' left-hand post. The Uruguayan's touch to Jordan Henderson's inswinging free-kick then diverted the ball into the net only to be denied by an offside flag, while Sterling should have scored after Suarez's pass was backheeled into his path by Fabio Borini but he shot straight at the keeper. But Oldham remained unbowed as they took great heart from the physical battles they were winning and were rewarded with a second goal moments before the interval. Smith, who had already had a header tipped over by Jones in added time, converted the simplest of chances after a howler by the Liverpool goalkeeper who fumbled Wabara's cross to allow Lee Croft to square a pass for the striker to poke home. Borini had the chance to equalise from Jack Robinson's cross with the second half less than a minute old but he side-footed over and it proved costly. The visitors' defensive fallibility in the air was exposed again on 48 minutes as Carl Winchester swung a cross to the far post and Wabara rose above Robinson to head over Jones into the far corner. Steven Gerrard's introduction from the bench was not long in coming and the England captain soon had a shot blocked from which Daniel Sturridge blazed over. Allen pulled one back with 11 minutes to go to with a shot which deflected in off Joe Baxter but Oldham held on to reach the fifth round for the first time in 19 years.",Raw Data
174,"For the first time since 2002, Douglas is not spending the winter months traveling between her home in Greece (with husband Vasilis) and basketball stops throughout Europe. While playing professionally in Russia, Spain, Turkey and Lithuania, Douglas has been a EuroLeague All-Star and a regular veteran in EuroLeague competition, once leading all of Europe in scoring and frequently competing with the top clubs on the continent. Absorbing the cultures, the languages and the cuisine has become one of the favorite staples of her worldly lifestyle. This winter though, she is spending the vast majority of her time doing rehabilitation at St. Vincent Sports Performance on the northwest side of Indianapolis where she consults with Fever doctors and trainers regularly. Immediately after the Fever season ended and championship hoopla subsided, Douglas was in a feverish mode to rehab and return to the court. She had dressed for Game 4 of the Finals with sincere hopes of a possible return in that series  albeit knowing she was not near 100 percent; and also knowing her team was playing with just nine players after a Game 2 injury to Jeanette Pohlen. The whole game, I was nervous, for the team and myself. Prior to the game, I had a talk with Coach [Dunn] and Kelly [Krauskopf] about playing me. Id worked extremely hard and went through shootaround that day, but everybody knew I was nowhere near 100 percent. With me and JP out, we were down to 9 [players]. If somebody else went out, there might be a situation where I might go in. I was extremely nervous, probably the most nervous Id ever been. We were playing for a world championship. I wanted to be in there so bad, but I didnt want to be a hindrance to the team. During and after the Finals, rehab was constant, though slow and frustrating with continued swelling and pain. Weeks after the Fever celebrations, she intended to make her debut with Wisla Can-Pack in Krakow, Poland, in mid-November, but a re-evaluation revealed her ankle had not completely healed. Plans to play in Poland were scrapped and team officials with Wisla turned to fellow WNBA star Alana Beard, instead. Douglas turned to her team of specialists and underwent surgery. Now, she visits the rehabilitation clinic usually twice a day. She maintains her ordinary strength and cardiovascular conditioning and spends the rest of her time between family and finding time for interests lost playing professionally almost 12 months per year for the past decade. Life has been great living here in Indianapolis and actually being an ordinary person. Everybody knows our schedule in the summer with the WNBA schedule and responsibilities. Ive definitely been given a lot of extra time with friends and family here. Its been amazing to reconnect with a lot of different people. I have spent time around family friends and doing a lot of things that I enjoy, that I like, that I cant do in other countries. People might not know that Im big into interior decorating and design. I almost have my house in Florida (Ft. Myers) pretty good now. I put a lot of work into it when I first got it, but usually I would just go down there to enjoy myself. It was just a sanctuary for me and I wasnt putting much effort into it. But in this time period, Ive been down there several times just to clean, re-organize and do little projects that have been neglected because I just didnt want to do them in the occasional 2-3 days at a time that I used to spend there. I just got a new place here in Indy last February. I did a lot with it in the summer, but now, having more free time, Ive comfortably done even more of what I have wanted to do with the place. Im a very clean and organized person. Being overseas usually for eight months at a time makes it difficult to stay organized. Ive been able to get caught up on paperwork and other things that have been neglected for so long. But for strengthening the ankle, Douglas body and mind are as healthy as ever. She has never had this much time between the stress and pressure of travel and playing games and leading her teams. The 33-year old knows she still has multiple years left in her playing career, but thoughts of anything beyond the short-term are purely secondary. Goals now are singular  she has immediate sights set on resuming basketball activity, including a return to action overseas before beginning the 2013 WNBA season with Fever teammates inside Bankers Life Fieldhouse. I took maybe a week off after we won, but ever since that time Ive been lifting and doing cardio as much as I could. I feel about the strongest I ever have been in my whole career. When youre overseas, you have travel and games and hard practices, but this has given me a chance to take care of my body. My body feels awesome and mentally, I feel rested because Im working out just for me. The first and sole focus right now is on my ankle. Im ahead of schedule and definitely looking forward to the next step which is getting back on the court. As her rehab and preparation continues, Douglas took the rare moment to reflect on the Fevers recent title  special to her as an Indianapolis native who initiated trade conversation to return to Indy in 2008, despite the pressure to perform for her hometown team. I think Ill always remember that moment where were all on the podium and holding the trophy finally. So many times we have done crazy little TV promos with the trophy; so many times I have been teased by the trophy and so many times I have been that other team walking off the floor without it. It felt so good to have that trophy in my hands. I think holding that trophy will be what I remember the most. Without a doubt, no question about it, I felt a sense of relief in finally winning a title. Theres a lot of pressure playing in front of your hometown, that I put on myself [when I wanted to come back here], but it definitely feels good to win a championship here. The small-town girl who helped bring Indianapolis a championship trophy still yearns for more, both in the WNBA and in a modern life of around-the-world travel. I just love the game. I cant envision my life without playing. I set goals for myself every offseason, no matter my age, to improve on my weaknesses and even my strengths. I never really imagined going and living overseas half the year, every single year, but its made me who I am as a person. I really wouldnt change anything that Ive done. Im proud of what Ive done and accomplished, but Im still very much an Indiana girl at heart. Ive been all over the world. Basketball has taken me so many places and Ive been blessed to do that. My roots, though, are here and I always want to maintain a life here. No matter her eventual legacy, Katie Douglas can take great pride in helping her city to its first professional basketball championship since 1973. But before any concerns with legacy and long-term goals, Douglas remains focused on her return to the court  sooner, rather than later.",Raw Data
175,"﻿I would be hard-pressed to remember a season that was anticipated like 2013 has been. There were so many unknowns about the new car going into Saturday night’s Sprint Unlimited. Did we get all the answers? We absolutely did not. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. But I have to say, I liked what I saw. Now, I know we didn’t really get to see what a pack of 43 drivers racing these cars will be like next Sunday in the Daytona 500 (coverage begins Noon ET on FOX) — especially not after we lost seven of 19 cars early in the race because of a crash — but even with the limited number of cars, there’s plenty to analyze. I still maintain we saw an awfully good race. I really liked what I saw when folks were going two-wide and three-wide. It’s now more of a science than ever before. No longer can you simply ride around there pushing the guy ahead of you until your engine gets too hot. Now, you really have to figure out where you want to be on the track and with whom. Saturday night also marked the return of the side-draft, which is something we haven’t seen in a little while. Tony Stewart, for one, made side-drafting work to his favor. Expect to see a few more drivers try that during the Budweiser Duel qualifying races Thursday and then in the 500 come Sunday. There at the end, I would have like to have seen Joey Logano and Matt Kenseth get hooked up together sooner. Had they done that, I think they may have been able to race eventual race winner Kevin Harvick back to the checkered flag. But that’s OK — Saturday night was about trying to take the checkered flag, but it was also about learning what these cars can do. If they are in a similar position, don’t expect either Logano or Kenseth (or any driver who watches the replay) to wait too long to make their final move. TRUE INNOVATION How did NASCAR get from Hudson Hornet to Generation 6 cars? See the transition. Speaking of race winner Harvick — we learned something else. For all those people that said “Happy” was going to enjoy a lame-duck season this year before moving to Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014, well he sure put that to rest. Let’s face it, both Harvick and his No. 29 Richard Childress Racing team are professionals. All they care about right now is winning. They will worry about the future later. Because of that approach, Harvick will go down in NASCAR history as the very first winner of the newly formatted Sprint Unlimited. Obviously in addition to that, he can lay claim to being the very first winner in this new Gen-6 race car. Saturday night we also got to see how a few of the teams with new drivers will perform. A couple of new pairings got off to a great 2013 start: Logano finished third Saturday night in what was his very first race for Penske Racing. Then there is Matt Kenseth, who ironically replaced Joey at Joe Gibbs Racing, who clearly had the fastest car but simply couldn’t get in the right position at the right time to pull off the victory. He still came away with a top five finish and that bodes well for the rest of 2013 Daytona Speedweeks. What will we see from them the rest of the year? Saturday night was only a taste — the real season begins Sunday on FOX.",Raw Data
176,"Jason Whitlock writes about the sports world from every angle, including those other writers can't imagine or muster courage to address. His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. Stephen A. Smith and ESPN think we forgot the fool-me idiom. Shame on them. Did Stephen A. Smith really drop an N-word on live TV? You be the judge. For the second time in less than a year, the black beard paid to mask Skip Bayless‘ blatant negro-baiting uttered “N-word, please” on a national-television platform allegedly reserved for non-profane, professional discussion. The first time was in December during a debate about LeBron James. Smith tweeted a denial. The second time was Thursday, when Smith was discussing Kobe Bryant. Smith, this time, taped a post-show denial. I’m not going to waste a lot of time breaking down the weakness of Smith’s latest denial. He dropped the N-word. The audio and video speak for themselves. Smith’s laughable denial — saying he's from New York and sometimes speaks too ""fastly"" — doesn’t even attempt to explain what he said if not “n---a, please.” Nope. The discussion today should focus on First Take, and why this particular show can’t avoid sprinkling the N-word into its discourse. Think about it. Across the television landscape, there are hundreds of talk shows. As best I can tell only one show and only one host are struggling to contain their love of the N-word while on national TV. I could be wrong — I don’t watch everything on TV — but is there another TV talk show where a host is annually blurting out the N-word? Are Kornheiser and Wilbon struggling with this? Michael and Kelly? The cast of Around the Horn? Bill O’Reilly? The crew on Morning Joe? Now, think about this: Stephen A. Smith has been running his mouth on TV for more than a decade. He’s good at it. He’s bright, articulate, passionate and quite informed on the NBA. I’m a Stephen A. Smith fan. I consider Smith a friend. When ESPN gave him his own talk show seven years ago, I thought Smith had a chance to be this generation’s Howard Cosell. When Smith’s show failed, I still believed in his talents. I believed he just needed more seasoning, more knowledge of the sports world beyond the NBA. That’s the job. For years, ESPN pitted a parade of attention-starved, mostly black stooges against Skip Bayless to legitimize and sanitize Skip’s over-the-top attacks on Terrell Owens, Chad Johnson, LeBron James and all the other low-hanging black fruit Skip could reach from his debate chair. The parade of stooges failed to properly protect Bayless. You could still see he was an insecure, disingenuous version of Glenn Beck. Enter Stephen A. Smith, desperate to re-emerge as a high-six-figures TV celebrity, desperate for his next hit from the TV crack pipe. Smith campaigned for the role of Skip’s beard. Recognizing that its black viewers couldn’t resist Skip’s bait, ESPN doubled down, making Smith an equal partner in the show and re-imagining First Take as the black barbershop of sports talk. The rap-music bumpers, the black, eye-candy female host, the guest appearances by rappers and Smith are all an attempt to make Skip’s negro-baiting palatable, marketable and justifiable. The show has been dumbed down and ghetto-ized. An environment has been created that entices Smith and others to bojangle and stoop to Bayless’ level of discourse. Terrell Suggs was celebrated for coming on the show and calling Bayless a “douchebag.” ESPN apologized for its Jeremy Lin headline in February, but this isn't a first offense for the media giant. Do not misconstrue my main point. In my opinion, Skip Bayless is not the bad guy. He is what he is. He’s never hid it. He will unfairly climb the back of any athlete — regardless of color — to compensate for his personal demons and insecurities. Bayless exposed himself decades ago when he groundlessly suggested a white, high-profile NFL quarterback was gay. No. Stephen A. Smith is the villain in this scenario. Smith has enormous broadcasting talent. Dancing for Bayless is beneath Smith. He also has the intellect to see how ESPN and Bayless are using him. Smith could be the Adam Schefter/Chris Mortensen of the NBA, a high-paid, invaluable information-and-insight guru. But taking on Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski is hard work. Dancing for Bayless is easy. Being half of ESPN’s hip hop, N-word-dropping sports show makes you more popular with celebrities. It’s fun. Smith has fallen for the okeydoke. You don’t have to. You were fooled the first time. And maybe you were fooled when ESPN took no action against Mike Greenberg when he said Martin Luther Coon on Martin Luther King’s national holiday. I’m not calling for Smith to be fired. He doesn’t deserve that. But don’t bring me this Mickey Mouse $h*# that he didn’t say it. Don’t do it when you unfairly suspended Max Bretos for a month for uttering a cliche about a flaw in Jeremy Lin’s armor. ""We asked Stephen A. what he said when the confusion arose over his remarks on First Take,” an ESPN executive told Dan Patrick’s radio show Friday morning. “He vehemently denied using any inappropriate language. We removed that part from the First Take re-air to avoid creating additional confusion if people misunderstood him . . . We believe him and no further action will occur."" Well, that settles it. I vehemently deny ever overeating! I’m a Midwesterner, and I chew my food really fast, so it occasionally appears I’m overeating. I’m no fool. This is a horrendous look for black journalists. Where are the standards? How will we have any credibility the next time a white broadcaster says anything remotely racist if we sit quiet while Smith gets away with this? Smith owes us an apology and a few days off work to think about how to properly and respectfully use the immense broadcasting talents he’s been blessed with.",Raw Data
177,"The Real Madrid superstar is set for a first clash with United since leaving the club for a world record £80m in 2009. Ronaldo secured three Premier League titles and a Champions League gong during six years at United, having joined as a 17-year-old. Ferguson rates Ronaldo as one of the best  and bravest  players he has ever worked with. Last month, the Old Trafford boss admitted he would love to see Ronaldo in United colours once again, but described his former starlet as unbuyable. Even though he thinks it is unlikely that Ronaldo, whose current deal expires in 2015, will strut his stuff for United again, he hopes it will happen one day. He said: ""Id love to see that, but its fanciful thinking ­really. First of all, how much it would take to get him from Real Madrid and secondly, I dont think theres any chance they would want to sell him. But you never know. I dont know when his contract finishes."" He may want to go to another club at some point in his career, and Id hope he would want to come here, but thats a long way off. Fergie added: ""The contract with Real says he cant play against us, seriously! I think it will be a disgrace if he plays against us. He has no loyalty to us!"" United fans still sing Ronaldos name during matches. And Ferguson thinks the Portuguese goal-machine deserves the reception he is ­assured on his return to Old Trafford for the Champions League clash in February. He revealed Ronaldo wanted to quit for the Bernabeu in 2008, but was persuaded to stay and helped guide United to his third Premier League title. Ferguson said: ""To get six years out of a boy when he comes at 17 and played for us for six years, weve done well. He always had a hankering to go to Madrid in his career and we helped him on that way. It wasnt disloyalty because I got another year out of him when he wanted to go the previous year and he honoured that and was fantastic for us. He went with our blessing. I was sorry when he left, dont get me wrong, but equally I was honoured that he gave me that extra year. I had absolutely no problem with letting him go to Real Madrid after that."" Fergie, whose side head to Swansea tomorrow, claims Paul Scholes, 38, has made no decision on his future yet. He also said Ryan Giggs, 39, could play for another two years and has rejected talk about defender Rio Ferdinands future. The United boss said: ""Scholesy says very little and I would be surprised if he spoke to some pal without speaking to me, which he hasnt done. Youve got to dismiss that and I think that Ryan Giggs will play for another year or two maybe. Rios form this year has been terrific. Its the kind of speculation you expect because we only put older players on one-year contracts."" Ferguson has also tied defender Jonny Evans to a new deal until 2016.",Raw Data

179,"ATLANTA — Two summers ago when the Falcons essentially went the draft-day equivalent of all-in by trading five picks to take wide receiver Julio Jones, there were mixed emotions about the selection. The Falcons bet the farm — trading two first-round picks, a second rounder and two fourth rounders in a span of two drafts — to take the University of Alabama standout on the premise that he would, indeed, live up to his all-world potential. Sunday's NFC Championship Game in the Georgia Dome served as one of the many justifications in 2012, as Jones once again decimated an opposing secondary, albeit in a losing effort to the San Francisco 49ers. Though the Falcons fell to the NFC's No. 2 seed 28-24 after taking an early 17-0 lead, Jones etched his name in stone on one of football's biggest stages. He finished with 11 catches for 182 yards and two touchdowns. His yardage ranks 15th most in an NFL playoff game since 1960, and his 11 receptions tied him for 11th with guys like Jerry Rice (1996) and his teammate Roddy White (2009). He also set the franchise playoff record for single-game receiving yards. Needless to say, he's more than earned his reputation as a game-changer. ""I thought Julio played great. He stepped up and we knew coming in that we needed guys to step up,"" Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan said. ""I thought he fought hard the entire day and he made some unbelievable catches and he was a big reason we were in it right there to the end."" Jones accounted for the game's two opening touchdowns, allowing the Falcons to take a commanding lead early in the second quarter and send the home crowd into a frenzy. On his first score, the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder left the 49ers defense in the dust for a wide-open 46-yard touchdown catch. The second came in even more spectacular fashion as Ryan lofted the ball to the back left corner of the end zone and Jones found his way underneath, just keeping both feet in. And just like that, 17-0. San Francisco was forced to change its approach after that, a tactic many teams have been forced to take this season versus the Falcons' passing game. ""They started rolling a lot of coverage to Julio's side. And then the later it got, they started playing a lot of 2-man after seeing how many plays we were hitting,"" Falcons receiver Harry Douglas said of his explosive teammate, who did not speak to the media following the game. ""It opened up a lot."" With the new coverage schemes, Ryan was able to find other receivers as well, spreading his 30 completions to six different receivers, including seven to White and eight to tight end Tony Gonzalez, who acknowledged in the locker room that the loss will, in all likelihood, be his final NFL game. Ryan finished with 396 yards and three touchdowns. In his second NFL season, Jones finished with 1,198 yards and 10 touchdowns, catapulting him into the upper echelon of the league's receivers. Don't expect him to go away anytime soon, either. He's just getting started, according to teammates. ""Julio's grown tremendously. He's understanding the game more mentally,"" said Douglas, who finished with three catches for 31 yards. ""He's really, really realizing that he's unstoppable. Can't no one stop him. And I even told him when he first started (vs. the 49ers), I said, 'Hey, keep getting it. There's even more out there to go get.' He's one of the best athletes I've ever seen in my life."" On that April night in 2011, right after he was drafted sixth overall, Jones offered up a premonition. For a guy with ""CHOSEN 1"" written across his shoulder blades, he did not mince his words. ""They can't double me. They can't double Roddy White. You got to pick your poison."" Eighteen months later, Super Bowl appearance or not, those words carry more weight than ever.",Raw Data

181,"The parents of Baltimore Ravens coach John and the San Francisco 49ers' Jim Harbaugh will be watched closely during Sunday's Super Bowl - if anybody finds them - for any visual evidence that mommy and daddy really do love one boy or the other best. It promises to be a fascinating sidebar to CBS' coverage of the game because, as Lynn and Rick Raisman can attest, parent cams are valuable in sports coverage. NBC's clip of the Raismans watching daughter Aly perform on the uneven bars during last summer's Olympics in London went viral, with stage parents everywhere relating to their murmurs and facial contortions. ''I had no idea it was going to be so great,'' said David Michaels, senior producer at NBC Sports, who often produces and directs coverage of gymnastics and figure skating, events where parental involvement can be particularly intense. Michaels makes it a point to know where parents are sitting during competitions, tracking them through spotters or sometimes sports governing bodies that know where parent seats have been assigned. Or where they are not sitting: Sometimes a dad who retreats to a concession stand because he can't bear to watch an offspring compete is a good story, too. Michaels said he tries not to overdo it, sticking with parents who he knows are interesting and very involved in their children's competitive undertakings. ''It has certainly gotten more ubiquitous,'' he said. ''Sometimes it's fantastic and sometimes it's just too gratuitous.'' Jack, a former college and high school football coach, and his wife will be attending the Super Bowl. On a conference call last week, the parents said they did not know where they would be sitting. Even if they did, they'd be unlikely to inform a horde of reporters about their seat locations. The senior Harbaugh was a college head coach at Western Michigan and Western Kentucky and an assistant at several places, including Michigan, Pittsburgh and Stanford. His son-in-law, Tom Crean, is the Indiana University men's basketball coach. It doesn't seem like a family that would want to watch a game casually while piling their plates with nachos. The couple had a practice run to see what it would be like to watch their sons coach against each other on Thanksgiving 2011, when older brother John's Ravens beat the 49ers 16-6. During that game, the couple watched in an office. Jack said his wife's face looked ''nearly comatose'' throughout the contest. ''She just stared at the screen,'' he said. ''Not a word was spoken. And at the end of the game, it was just over.'' They'll experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat - all at once. A 75-yard touchdown pass that would be reason to stand up and cheer for one son is another son's horrible defensive lapse. ''I am going to be neutral in the game,'' Jackie Harbaugh said. ''I know one is going to win and one is going to lose, but I would really like to end in a tie. Can the NFL do that?'' CBS Sports President Sean McManus said there will be a pregame feature about the familial battle. It would be hard to argue otherwise; no matter how much the brothers want to downplay it, it's a unique situation. But McManus said CBS would try not to let it dominate its coverage of the game. Given the need for the coaches' parents to stay neutral, longtime TV critic David Bianculli said he wondered how much of a story it will be visually for CBS. If they really maintain impassive faces, how much will viewers want to see them on the screen? ''I would advise them to pay attention to the field, more than anything else,'' said Bianculli, who teaches about television for Rowan University. A stone face is a story, too, Michaels said. The only question is how much a producer should go back to the shot. He said he can't imagine CBS not knowing where the couple is. If they're out in public, the network will likely keep a close eye on their reactions. ''As a producer or a director in this kind of a situation, it's incumbent upon you to know where every element of the story is because you never know how it's going to evolve,'' Michaels said. Finding the right approach ultimately shouldn't be much of a problem for CBS, he said. ''It's a little bit of a distraction at times,'' he said. ''But they'll figure out the best way to deal with it. The pictures won't lie.''",Raw Data
182,"The fight was stopped after the eighth round when an accidental head-butt by Salido broke Garcia's nose near the end of the round. Garcia won by scores of 79-70, 79-69 and 79-69. ''It is very broken,'' said Dr. Robert Polofsky, one of two New York State athletic commission physicians. ''He couldn't breathe. It's too dangerous to have him continue the fight like that. So we made the decision to stop the fight.'' Garcia said: ''I didn't know my nose was broken. But I felt the pain from the head-butt.'' Even before the accidental head-butt, Garcia (31-0) was dominating the fight, having knocked Salido down four times before the fight was stopped.

Garcia also dominated by landing 39 percent of his punches, including 51 percent of his power punches. Despite those overwhelming numbers, he still was disappointed that he did not record his 27th career knockout. ''It's a great feeling,'' Garcia said. ''But I would have preferred the fight to go 12 rounds and finish the fight. If it would have been a knockout it would have been even better. The timing of the stoppage also may have worked to Garcia's advantage. Want to follow what's going on in the ring? We've got everything you need with news and analysis, schedules, photos, video, current champions and more from around the boxing world. Salido began coming on in the seventh round, the only round he won on two scorecards. Salido also felt if the fight had gone longer that it could have given him more time to record a knockout. ''In the seventh round, I felt like I was getting to him,'' Salido said through an interpreter. ''I had five rounds to get this guy and I felt like I was on my way. Before that flurry in the seventh, a Salido victory did not even seem possible. ''It was a unanimous decision win and I was beating him up,'' Garcia said. ''I was working to keep him off me with the jab. If I could breathe better, I would have continued to fight. We had a game plan and it was working perfectly.'' Garcia set a dominating tone right from the start as he knocked Salido down twice in opening round. Garcia knocked Salido down with a hard right cross halfway through the round and then dropped him again with a sweeping left hook just before the bell. After Salido survived the second round, he went down for a third time midway through the third when Garcia used his uppercut. That sent Salido off-balance to the point where his glove touched the canvas. Garcia recorded another knockdown midway through the fourth by getting Salido to run into a left jab. The opener of the triple-header was a draw as Rocky Martinez (26-1-12) retained his WBO junior lightweight title against Juan Carlos Burgos (26-1-2). One judge had Burgos winning handily at 117-111 while another thought Martinez won easily 116-112 but it was the 114-114 score that helped Martinez retain his belt. In the other undercard, Gennady Golovkin (25-0) retained his WBA middleweight title with a bloody victory over Gabriel Rosado (21-6) that resulted in a seventh-round TKO. Rosado began bleeding in the second round with a cut under his left eye that eventually trickled down his face and trainer Billy Briscoe threw in the towel with 14 seconds remaining in the seventh round, giving Golovkin his 22nd career knockout despite reportedly being sick two days earlier.",Raw Data

184,"Team president Glen Grunwald said Martin will be signed to a 10-day contract with the hopes that he could stay with the team for the remainder of the season. Grunwald said Martin will be insurance for injured big men Rasheed Wallace and Marcus Camby, a pair of 38-year-old backup forwards who have both been battling foot injuries. ""We've always liked Kenyon, he's a great competitor and good defender,"" Grunwald said on a conference call, adding that Martin was already familiar with many Knicks. ""We think that there will be some synergies already built into the mix and we're just looking forward to adding a good defender who can help us in our quest this season."" Martin played with Carmelo Anthony, J.R. Smith and Camby in Denver before spending last season with the Los Angeles Clippers, averaging 5.2 points in 42 games. He also teamed with Jason Kidd in New Jersey on teams that reached the NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003. But Martin, 35, has been injury prone in recent years. Still, he's a rugged and versatile defender whom Grunwald thinks can help. ""We watched a lot of the tape of his season last year with the Clippers and he played very well,"" Grunwald said. ""We're hopeful that he's going to show that he's still got what it takes to be an NBA player."" Brewer was a starter earlier this season who lost his spot - and eventually his place in the rotation entirely - after a shooting slump. He was dealt for a 2014 second-round pick and cash. Brewer was phased out once Iman Shumpert returned from knee surgery. Never much of a scorer, Brewer had played well during the Knicks' strong start, but never recovered once things started to go bad and Grunwald didn't really know why. ""I'm not really sure, but he obviously was not playing and we just tried to look at what our team needed to move forward,"" Grunwald said. Grunwald said Brewer didn't demand a trade, and said the team didn't consider moving Shumpert, who has struggled since returning from his torn knee ligament and whose name was linked to various rumors. Brewer appeared in 46 games, making 34 starts, and averaged 3.6 points and 2.2 rebounds. Signed by New York last summer, he has also played for Utah, Chicago and Memphis. Grunwald wasn't certain if Martin would be available when the Knicks face Philadelphia on Sunday, saying it may not be until next week.

185,"Tom Bradys life is better than yours and mine. Hes more famous. He has more money. DIVISIONAL SCOREBOARD Ravens 38, Broncos 35 (2OT) 49ers 45, Packers 31 Falcons 30, Seahawks 28 Patriots 41, Texans 28 Hes better at his job quarterbacking the New England Patriots than we are at ours. He usually beats your favorite team. Hes better looking, too, with a smile that can cause admirers to swoon. Plus, he has a more attractive significant other unless you are married to a supermodel like Gisele Bundchen. This combination makes it easy for non-Patriots fans to loathe Brady. Everything is so damn perfect. He is the embodiment of New Englands 12-year NFL dynasty. When the Patriots run up the score on the opposition, they do so with Brady unmercifully staying on the field until late in the fourth quarter. As if getting crushed wasnt bad enough. Thats another reason why his failings are more universally celebrated than other players who sometimes fall short. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman became a cult hero when taunting Brady after an October win, then tweeting a photo of the confrontation that included the now-famous caption, U Mad Bro? The Baltimore Ravens and their following will be distraught if Brady wins Sunday in a second straight AFC Championship game matchup. There will be further envy across the board should Brady capture a fourth Super Bowl ring. Such bitterness comes with the territory. But theres one emotion that Brady lovers and haters should share toward him: Respect. Hes earned it. Dont be fooled by his offseason modeling that is approaching Zoolander-like absurdity (the photo of a sneering Brady wearing a suit and dog collar for something called VMAN Magazine was particularly ridiculous). Behind those blue eyes is someone who remains every bit as blue-collar as when he entered the NFL. PATRIOTS 41, TEXANS 28 New England overwhelms Houston Unsung heroes spark veteran Pats Did Texans learn ANYTHING?!?! Video: Recap | Surprise stars Playoff Picture: Road to Super Bowl Brady still hasnt forgotten the indignity of being the sixth quarterback chosen in the 2000 draft class after sliding into the sixth round. Bradys passion for the game remains first and foremost in his professional life. I really love playing football, Brady said Wednesday when I asked him about the subject during a Patriots news conference. A lot of my time and energy is spent focused on trying to help this team win and trying to be a good teammate and leader. I take those things very seriously. I try not to buy into what people say or think. I just live my life and certainly enjoy being the quarterback for this team. Theres nothing more fun than running out onto the field in front of 70,000 people cheering for us. Thats what it will be this weekend. Bradys perspective on not letting his football get affected by the trappings of celebrity and keeping his own ego in check was shaped by Patriots players who came before him. Brady cited three now-retired veterans Tedy Bruschi, Lawyer Milloy and Willie McGinnest as helping him learn the Patriot Way of doing your job so that everyone around you can do their job. At 35 years old, Brady now provides the same advice for New Englands younger players who are in danger of going astray from the program. More than anything, Brady leads by example. Veteran wide receiver Brandon Lloyd was unaware of just how strong Bradys work ethic was until joining the Patriots in the offseason. We like to think that the best players are the hardest workers, Lloyd said. Tom proved that when I got here. Patriots defensive tackle Vince Wilfork said he remains awed by Bradys approach. You get a chance to see him on the field and (not) behind closed doors, said Wilfork, who joined the Patriots in 2004. What he is doing in the film room, how he is taking the younger guys or a group of guys from offense and seeing if they want to do things a certain way, or working on footwork Sometimes I look at him in practice and I say, Man, you have been doing this for so long and you are still worried about your footwork? But it is just little things. He is always going that extra mile to make sure he is in the best shape and putting his teammates in the best situation that can give us a chance to win. New Englands 41-28 victory over Houston last Sunday helped Brady set the all-time record for career playoff wins by a starting quarterback with 17. His overall winning percentage of .777 (136-39) is the best of any passer in the Super Bowl era. Bradys individual statistics are just as impressive. Brady, though, wasnt the best quarterback on the field during his past two Super Bowl appearances. Eli Manning was. The same applies for last seasons AFC title game against Baltimore when Brady was outplayed by Joe Flacco. Brady was battling injuries during those games but never let on with how badly he was hurt. Nor did he ever use that as an excuse. Those kinds of missed opportunities are personally devastating, which explains why Brady doesnt take winning for granted. Another example came last Sunday when he was screaming at teammates on the sideline to not let up even when the Patriots had opened a 25-point lead on the Texans with 13 minutes remaining in the game. Such urgency is understandable. After he won three Super Bowls by the age of 27, the expectation was for Brady to set the bar on championships to unreachable heights. It didnt turn out that way. Following a loss to the Manning-led New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, the Patriots went four seasons before playing for another Lombardi Trophy. Brady also experienced what life would be like without football in 2008 when he missed almost the entire season with a knee injury. He was miserable. That was Bradys first personal taste of knowing that his NFL days wont last forever. He knows the end of his career now is far closer than the start. For those sick of Brady being Brady, that day cant come soon enough.",Raw Data
186,"Cal picked up a crucial 76-68 win over USC on Sunday night, but the teams come-from-behind victory after facing a 15-point deficit in the second half has taken a back seat to a more controversial discussion. During a timeout in the second half, Cal head coach Mike Montgomery became frustrated with junior guard Allen Crabbe and let him know about it by giving him a stern, two-handed shove to the chest. Montgomery says he was trying to get Crabbes head in the game, but many people thought the physical contact crossed the line. He had no expression, Montgomery told reporters after the game, via The Dagger. Mentally, he just needed a wakeup call. Crabbe was clearly upset by the shove, as he needed some of his teammates and a trip toward the tunnel to finally cool down. For what its worth, he ended up scoring 10 points in the final 4:20 of the game to spark the Bears comeback victory. And after the game, Crabbe hardly seemed upset over the exchange. It was coach using his way of motivating me, he said in his postgame press conference. There was nothing wrong with it. It was just spur of the moment. An emotional game was going on at the time and he was trying to motivate me. But everythings fine. Its under the bridge. Hes my coach. No hard feelings about it. Montgomery joked with reporters that his motivation tactic worked before admitting that he probably overdid it a little bit. We were standing around. Nobody was ready to play, he said. Allen had come down twice, hed gone to the wrong side of the floor and his guy shot two threes in. I was trying to get him going. Allens my guy. I need him. We cant win if hes not ready to play. This is the third season Montgomery has coached Crabbe, so you could argue that he simply knows how to get through to one of his best players. Had Cal gone on to lose, the postgame discussion may have been much different. While I personally feel that the shove does not require any disciplinary action, we should note that coaches at the lower levels have been fired for allegedly making contact with players. In the 21st century, its usually best to just keep your hands off the youngsters you are coaching.",Raw Data
187,"FOX race analyst Larry McReynolds has more than 30 years of NASCAR experience as a mechanic, Daytona 500-winning crew chief and broadcaster. He earned 23 Cup wins as a crew chief, including two victories in the prestigious Daytona 500, as well as a pair of non-points victories in the annual all-star race. Going into Sunday’s season-ending NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Homestead-Miami Speedway, everyone pretty much thought things would turn out the way they did. But I’ve got to be honest: The race caught us a little off guard. We felt like Jimmie Johnson and the 48 team were going to swing for the fence because they had to since they entered the race 20 points behind leader Brad Keselowski and considering that in the last 21 races, Keselowski has finished 15th or better in 20 of them. Not being able to forecast a flat tire like Jimmie had at Phoenix or even what happened to Jimmie Sunday with a pit-road penalty and then a mechanical issue, we felt like that it was Brad Keselowski’s championship to lose. But I’ve got to say, when the race started and even through it, he and his Penske Racing team didn’t have the car that I thought they would based on how they qualified and watching them in practice Saturday. I thought they had a car that might even contend for the win. The thing that concerned me, on that third caution at Lap 155, when pretty much all the drivers and Jimmie Johnson pitted to put them in position to be able to make it on one more stop – I was quite surprised that crew chief Paul Wolfe did not pit Keselowski that time. I’ve said all week, they’re only racing one driver and one team here. Whatever that team does, just do the same thing because you know that if you stay with them, you’re going to beat them for the championship. When they elected to stay out, I was very shocked. Yes there were seven other drivers that stayed out, but those drivers are trying to win the race. Brad Keselowski was trying to win the championship. It made it so that he and his team still had to make two more stops. I thought, “Gosh, have they given this championship away here?” Brad Keselowski told us on SPEED’S Victory Lane that he played a role in making that call and it was a bad call. But obviously they were given a gift back when under the next set of green-flag pit stops on Lap 213 -- when Jimmie Johnson was making his final stop -- his team had a left rear lug nut that was missing and he had to come back to pit road. That Hendrick Motorsports crew has not made a lot of mistakes on pit road – obviously neither one of these teams have made a lot of mistakes on pit road this year. That ended up not making a difference because Jimmie Johnson had the hole in the rear end line so they had to go back to the garage area and he ended up finishing back in 36th position. It was definitely a different race than we were anticipating, but there was no question that until the 48 car started having issues that Johnson and his team were doing exactly what they needed to do. They were trying some different strategy. They did a two-tire stop one time to take the lead to get that point for leading, to get that track position, but at the end of the day the title race ended up being different than we thought it would be -- but with the ending we expected with Brad Keselowski getting this championship. I think it’s good that we have gotten a new champion, a young champion. He’s 28 years old, he’s very heavily into social media and that kind of falls to the demographic that we’re trying to lure back into this sport. I said this on Victory Lane and it was kind of misunderstood, but the fans have been kind of disgruntled because they felt like the last few champions have not been outspoken, they’ve been almost a little on the vanilla side. The thing about it is, with this guy, they’re going to be far from that. I wasn’t saying that Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart were vanilla drivers, I wasn’t saying that, but the fans are looking for a different style of driver and Brad Keselowski is very outspoken. Keselowski showed that Sunday night when he came to the stage for the show and basically saturated the four of us on the show with Miller Lite beer. He’s going to represent our sport well, but he’s definitely going to be a different champion than NASCAR has been used to the last five, six, seven years.",Raw Data
188,"A fourth-tier team featuring a former supermarket shelf-stacker, a cancer survivor and players released by top clubs are hoping to beat a Premier League outfit for the fourth time this season when Bradford take on Swansea City in Sunday's League Cup final. ""It's going to be the biggest game we've played in our lives,"" right back Stephen Darby told Reuters on Tuesday. ""Over the last few years the football club hasn't had a lot to shout about but it's going to be a massive day for everyone, it's great for Bradford City and the people of Bradford."" The Bantams are the first fourth-tier side to reach a major English cup final for 51 years and will be making only their second Wembley appearance - the previous one being the 1996 third-tier playoff final. After several miserable seasons since relegation from the Premier League in 2001, including two spells in administration, the feat of a fourth-tier team beating Arsenal, Wigan Athletic and Aston Villa en route to Wembley is the stuff of dreams. The club, whose only major silverware is the 1911 FA Cup, is also probably best known for tragedy rather than glory after a 1985 fire at its Valley Parade ground killed 56 fans. It is not just the football club that has lived under black clouds. The West Yorkshire city has been harder hit than many by the economic downturn, it has higher-than average crime rates and is also still remembered for race riots in 2001. ""Bradford is known for bad things like riots. There are no shops, there's a lot of negative,"" fan Julia North said after giving her 12-year-old son Liam money to get the club's claret and amber flags. ""It's great there's now something positive."" Thrilled Liam added: ""It means the whole world to me. When we beat Villa (in the semi-final) I just went mental."" There is a buzz around the city with stalls selling anything from paper masks with the face of manager Phil Parkinson to T-shirts emblazoned 'Bradford City Giant Killers Marching on Wembley Way'. One pub near the train station was advertising being open from 0430 on Sunday for anyone wanting ale or food before heading south while the local newspaper is printing cut-out-and-keep posters of the players. The cup run will provide the club with a cash injection of more than two million pounds ($3 million) - an amount that would pay one of the Premier League's top earners around eight weeks' wages but for Bradford that should mean long-term financial security. ""It's the owners' job and my job to make sure this extra revenue is used to keep improving the structure of the club and make sure our supporters have got a football club in years to come that is going to flourish,"" said Parkinson. ""That is really important. Much as we are all going to enjoy this weekend, on the back of that it does give us revenue which we wouldn't have expected to make so we are going to have to use it very wisely."" Lying mid-table in the fourth tier, with 44 points from 31 games, Bradford are punching well above their weight with a group of players who have made up for their lack of big transfer fees with a huge show of determination and a slice of luck. There are no household names, only the likes of striker James Hanson who used to work in a local supermarket and headed the goal that booked the place in the final or Reading reject Carl McHugh who almost never made it as a professional. Their most experienced player is probably goalkeeper Matt Duke, who made Premier League appearances for Hull City and who has recovered after being diagnosed with testicular cancer five years ago. Victory over Swansea would earn Bradford a place in the Europa League, their first continental appearance since the now defunct Intertoto Cup in 2000, and a concept that some players could not get their heads around. ""It would be crazy, it would be mental but it would be unbelievable for the club,"" said McHugh who is taking 111 friends and family with him to Wembley. ""We're going to be underdogs. It's going to take Swansea having an off day and us being right at the top of our game and having a little bit of luck to win it."" The lack of expectation is what forward Alan Connell reckons has been the key to Bradford's successful cup run and that could help them against Swansea. ""I honestly haven't even thought about winning it. It's all a bit of a fairytale,"" he said. ""Being the underdogs has helped us, we're just very relaxed and very disciplined as a team. We've got a game against 11 players, let's go and play.""",Raw Data
189,"After years of anticipation, two months was all it took for “Hello Brooklyn!” to give way to “Goodbye Avery!” as the Nets fired head coach Avery Johnson on Thursday in the wake of a 14-14 start to the team’s debut season in Brooklyn. The move was made hastily, but perhaps not surprisingly, by an impatient team — and, more particularly, an impetuous billionaire owner, Mikhail Prokhorov — desperate to recapture the nation’s attention after quickly relinquishing it with substandard play on the court over the last few weeks. Proof of this could even be seen in reports late Thursday night that the Nets have targeted Phil Jackson as their top choice to replace Johnson. Fair or not, Johnson received the brunt of the blame for the Nets’ December flop, which saw them go from Eastern Conference contender to Atlantic Division punching bag. Johnson was made a scapegoat for the current 3-10 slide that has Brooklyn teetering on the edge of the draft lottery with one-third of the season complete. “You never think when you’re a .500 team and you’re going into two more home games, that something like this will happen,” Johnson said Thursday at the team’s practice facility. “But this is ownership’s decision. … Maybe ownership thought when we were 11-4 that we were going to go 11-4 every month the whole season, and it just didn’t happen.” Hard as it is to believe or remember, things actually started well this season for Johnson, who compiled a misleading 60-116 record in two-plus years at the helm of a Nets team that, before this year, was hapless by design as it cleared cap space and prepared for its much-anticipated move to New York. Johnson earned NBA Coach of the Month honors for November after leading the Nets to the best 15-game start in franchise history. And the torrid November, which included wins over the Celtics, Clippers and Knicks, had some touting Johnson as an early candidate for his second Coach of the Year award. But with the start of December came a ramped-up schedule, and losses to the Heat, Thunder, Warriors, Knicks, Bulls and Celtics, among others, exposed the Nets as a fraud — or at the very least, not the title contender we thought they were. So Avery, apparently, had to go, at Prokhorov’s behest. “Watching us, we just didn’t have the same fire that we had when we were 11-4,” Nets general manager Billy King said. “I’ve been trying to talk to Avery, we’ve been trying to figure it out, but we haven’t been able to pinpoint what was missing. When you lose to the Celtics, you lose to the Knicks like we did, you lose to Milwaukee — these are teams that you talk about competing with. It was a pattern.” The biggest reason for the Nets’ regression has been their defense. During the 11-4 start, Brooklyn held opponents to 44.9 percent shooting and 32.1 percent from 3-point range while allowing an NBA-best 90.9 points per game. But since the start of December, the Nets have allowed opponents to shoot 47.4 percent, second worst in the league, and a third-worst 40.4 percent from downtown while allowing 98.9 points a night. The more visible issue, however, has been the offense. That has drawn the ire of some of Johnson’s best players, including point guard Deron Williams, who passed up on an opportunity to play with his hometown Dallas Mavericks to return to Brooklyn alongside Joe Johnson and Gerald Wallace this summer. There’s a case to be made that Johnson may be a casualty of Williams’ dissatisfaction with the Nets’ start and his role in it. In recent weeks, Williams, who is largely blamed for forcing Jerry Sloan’s retirement in Utah, has publicly voiced his displeasure at Brooklyn’s isolation-heavy offense. But Johnson said his firing and Williams’ frustration weren’t directly related. “I thought from Day 1 we had a really good relationship and I don’t think it’s fair for anyone to hang this on Deron,” Johnson said. “He’s one player, we had 15 players, and it’s up to the coach really to try to maximize the team.” Added King: “The one thing I value is the fact that I have a pretty good pulse of players, not just Deron but all our guys. And I just got a sense . . . that, for some reason, (Johnson) wasn’t reaching them anymore. It happens in sports, especially at the professional level, but to pinpoint this on Deron, it’s not fair.” It’s unclear who will get the next permanent shot at turning this team around. For the moment, Nets assistant and longtime NBA head coach P.J. Carlesimo will serve in an interim role. But along with Jackson, names like Stan Van Gundy and, in the twist of all twists, Williams’ former coach, Sloan, have been thrown around as possible replacements, though it’s not known how viable any of them are. Whomever it does end up hiring, Brooklyn won’t be able to make that person a sacrificial lamb should the team’s downward spiral continue. As the Los Angeles Lakers have already shown this season, restoring order to a bumbling, free-spending franchise with high expectations is not always as simple as merely firing a coach on shaky ground — though the guy with the clipboard is almost always the first person to go. “You’re not going to always get a fair shake,” Johnson said. “If I was owning the team, I wouldn’t have gotten fired today. I wouldn’t have fired myself, because I know what I’m dealing with and I know what the future can hold. But it just doesn’t work that way. “This is not all about the fair game. A lot of time it’s about the blame game, because for the most part in this business, the coach always gets blamed. Whether that’s fair or not is not the point. That’s just the way it happens.” And if the Nets don’t return to their winning ways from earlier this season, they’ll be forced to do some sincere reflection on what’s gone wrong, what really has to change, and why a knee-jerk firing of a loyal coach doing the best he could with a roster that didn’t quite fit together wasn’t the answer. Johnson said he expected to meet with King on Jan. 15, when the team can begin to make trades, to discuss the franchise’s successes and failures so far and establish a direction going forward, perhaps adding and subtracting players as he saw fit. But he never got that chance. And that’s the shame in all this — that Johnson never got to see the project through. This team spent like the league’s best with little thought given to how its expensive, new pieces would mesh together on the floor, and, predictably, the countless millions haven’t resulted in countless wins. There are a number of directions the Nets could have gone to help rectify the situation, but firing the coach shouldn’t have been one of them. It’s a raw deal for Johnson, who willingly got crushed for two seasons in Newark, both on the court and by the media, for the sake of a team and its future. It’s an overreaction that will likely only pave the way for another overraction, when the team starts making trades to try to address its flaws. “I’m not one to shy away from making a trade,” King said. “But it’s trying to figure out what trade to make. Once you start moving some pieces, you’re rearranging the whole thing, so before we do that, we wanted to (do) this, and see where we go from here.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data
190,"After missing the last two weeks with a severely sprained neck, the fearless shooting guard returned Saturday and scored 24 points, knocked down three 3-pointers, made 13 of 14 free throws, dished out a career-high nine assists and led the Bulldogs to an 83-71 victory over Temple. Welcome back, kid. ''It felt really good. When something like that happens, it puts a lot of things in perspective,'' Clarke said. ''I felt pretty normal.'' For most of the day, he looked like his old self, too. Clarke repeatedly sent 3-pointers over the outstretched arms of defenders, confounding and frustrating them at the same time. He drove relentlessly through the lane, crashing hard to the floor once in each half. Yes, it brought back memories of that Jan. 12 play at Dayton when he crashed head first into a padded basket support head first and then stayed down for eight minutes before being taken off on a stretcher. On Saturday, Clarke, thankfully, bounced up right away both times as he continued to play his way. And when Temple (13-6, 2-3 Atlantic 10) dared to chase Clarke with extra defenders, Clarke had no trouble finding teammates who were willing and able to knock down open shots. It was a far cry from how the Bulldogs (16-3, 4-1) played in Wednesday's loss at La Salle, their only defeat since Nov. 21. Butler has won 14 of 15, including three wins that came with Clarke on the bench. Clearly, Butler couldn't wait to get him back. ''With his ability to shoot and create shots, and when two guys run at him that opens things up for the rest of us,'' Khyle Marshall said after finishing with 19 points and five rebounds. ''The attention he gets makes it easier for our other guys.'' There was no doubt Saturday. Marshall took advantage of his openings with a nice blend of dunks and mid-range jumpers. Freshman guard Kellen Dunham, who returned to the bench Saturday after replacing Clarke in the starting lineup for the previous three games, still managed to make 5 of 6 from 3-point range and finished with 17 points. Forward Roosevelt Jones, who made the winning shot last week against then No. 8 Gonzaga, finished with nine points, three rebounds and three assists, and the Bulldogs wound up shooting 52 percent from the field overall. The combination was just too much for Temple. ''When a kid like Dunham comes off the bench and does what he did today, that's difficult to defend,'' Owls coach Fran Dunphy said. ''Then you've got Clarke on the other side, that's tough to tag and then when a kid like Marshall hits some shots from outside. ... They've got a lot of weapons, no doubt. I like their team.'' Dunphy was just hoping for better results in Temple's first ever trip to Hinkle Fieldhouse. The Owls were led by Khalif Wyatt, who scored 16 of his 22 points in the first half and had with six assists. Scootie Randall had 13 points and four rebounds, and Anthony Lee had 12 points and seven rebounds on a day that another Philadelphia team was trying to topple another top 10 foe. In addition to La Salle's court-storming win Wednesday, Villanova beat Louisville and Syracuse this week. But Temple failed in its quest Saturday, dropping to 1-3 against the top 10 this season, largely because of Clarke, who sat out last season after transferring from Arkansas. ''He never stops moving, he's quick and likes to get his team involved, too,'' Randall said. ''You try to stay on his hip, you try to stay with him, but he's just a good player.'' It didn't take the Owls long to figure things out. Despite losing starting guard T.J. DiLeo with a high ankle sprain in the first three minutes, Temple managed to control the first part of the game. The Bulldogs swung things in their favor with a 12-0 first-half run that allowed them to take a 37-34 led into the locker room that they extended by scoring the first seven points of the second half. Temple charged back after trailing 51-38, using an 18-5 spurt to tie the score at 56 on Rahlir Hollis-Jefferson's three-point play. But that's when the Bulldogs cranked it up. Marshall broke the tie with a dunk with an assist from Clarke and Dunham hit back-to-back 3s, both with assists from Clarke. Jones turned a nifty pass from Andrew Smith into a layup, Smith followed that flurry with two free throws and then Jones scored on another layup, courtesy of yet another pass from Clarke. When the 16-4 spurt ended, the Bulldogs led 72-60, leaving Temple in the dust. ''We're better in transition time when Rotnei's in the game because of the way he passes and because he's a threat to shoot when he crossed midcourt,'' Brad Stevens said. ''It was heart-warming to have him back on the court, knowing what he went through and how hard it was for him.''",Raw Data
191,"That is the wrong information and I work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention: to harm ARSENE WENGER let slip that he is feeling the heat following Arsenal's latest demoralising defeat. The Gunners crashed out of the FA Cup to Championship side Blackburn on Saturday, increasing the chances they will extend their trophyless run. It is nearly eight years since Arsenal last won silverware, with their hopes resting on the Champions League for this season. Despite the lean spell, reports over the weekend suggested Wenger has opened talks on extending his stay at the Emirates beyond 2014. But Wenger today hit out at such rumours, denying he has begun to discuss a new deal. At a prickly press conference before tomorrow night's Champions League last-16 clash with Bayern Munich, Wenger let loose. ""That is the wrong information and I work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention: to harm,"" he said. ""If it is good information which comes from nowhere it is all right, but this is wrong information that comes from nowhere and it is completely wrong."" Wenger also became involved in a heated one-on-one with a journalist. ""I look at you not because you give information, I do not know if it is you, I do not know where the information comes from. Why do you look at me? I just thought you had given this information out. ""Here this is a pre-match conference for the Champions League, if you want to talk about Saturday, that press conference has been made after the game. ""Can we get some questions about tomorrow's game, that would be very nice."" Wenger later stated he had full confidence in his players to bounce back against Bayern, highlighting his side's experience of playing in the latter stages of the Champions League. ""We know well what is going on here. What is important is to forget what people say and focus on our strengths,"" he said. ""We play for Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions league, we have qualified for a long, long time. ""What is important is not what people say, it is what happens on the pitch.""

193,"Carmelo Anthony wasted little time letting his frustration be known after the New York Knicks’ 102-96 loss to the Boston Celtics on Monday night. In fact, Anthony apparently was so worked up over his team’s sixth defeat in 11 games that he wanted to let his Atlantic Division rivals know first-hand. Following his 6-of-26 shooting performance, one of the worst of his career, the Knicks star was reportedly involved in an exchange outside the visitors locker room at Madison Square Garden, possibly with Celtics forward Kevin Garnett, with whom he had several dust-ups during the hotly contested game — one resulting in double-technical fouls for the two All-Stars. After the game, no one in either locker room would confirm the report, though the players wouldn’t necessarily deny it either. Conveniently, everyone was clueless as to what had or hadn’t gone on. But every indication — the coy smiles, the careful, overwrought language — said that something had gone down. Check out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo. What? We may never know for sure, though a Comcast Sports New England video showed Anthony pacing and waiting for KG near the Celtics’ team bus. That’s all there is to go on for now. “I’m going to let you all figure that out,” said Celtics coach Doc Rivers, who saw his team win its third straight game after losing eight of 10 between Dec. 14 and Jan. 2. “I’m going to stay out of that. If it was the playoffs, I’d tell on him, but since it’s not, I’m going to just be quiet.” When pressed, Garnett (19 points, 10 rebounds) was equally coy (not that he’s ever overly forthright when it comes to such matters) and brushed the maybe-disturbance off as “just basketball.” And ‘Melo himself — well, he left without addressing the media after the game, his empty locker doing the speaking for him as his silence said more than he ever would have, anyway. Paul Pierce, who led the Celtics with 23 points, wasn’t about to be goaded into dishing on the fracas, nor was Avery Bradley, who played the stingiest defense the Knicks have seen in some time. Bradley also scored 13 points in place of Rajon Rondo, who had been suspended by the league for contact with an official in Sunday’s win over Atlanta. Most around the Knicks locker room were, unsurprisingly, somewhere else at the time of the quarrel — J.R. Smith (24 points) was getting 11 stitches above his right eye; Amar’e Stoudemire (13 points) was getting treatment on his knee; and Marcus Camby and Steve Novak didn’t recall where they were, but they definitely weren’t in the hallway trying to hold ‘Melo back. Wink, wink. “‘Melo’s a very fiery guy, believe it or not,” Smith said. “He doesn’t like to lose, and he doesn’t like when people try to come up in his face. It is what it is.” Added Novak: “We’re at home and we expect to win, he (Anthony) expects to win. And I think it’s healthy, I think it’s good. I think that he puts a lot of importance on all these games. He doesn’t take it lightly, and I think that’s what you want to see out of your leader.” Though the details of the dust-up are scarce, and may remain that way, it’s clear Anthony let Garnett and the Celtics get the best of him Monday. But at least Anthony can take comfort in the knowledge that, over the last week, Boston has burned just about everyone during a mini-revival following the team’s challenging run through December. On Friday and Saturday, Boston (17-17) logged convincing wins over Atlanta and Indiana, the third- and fourth-seeded teams in the Eastern Conference, respectively, before heading to New York for Monday’s win over the second-seeded Knicks. Monday’s win came just in time for the Celtics’ return to TD Garden for a five-game homestand. “The last three games have been terrific,” Rivers said. “When you’ve got Indiana and Atlanta back-to-back and then you play the Knicks after that, and to win all three of those games, that’s great for our team. Winning this game here, without Rondo, just tells you our guys hung in there.” Though Boston played solid offensively against the Knicks, who have made their name on defense this season, it was their defense that owned the night. The Celtics held New York to 40.8 percent shooting from the floor and have limited opponents to 37.5 percent shooting during their three-game win streak as they’ve looked a lot like the title-contending Celtics of old. “We’re defending a whole lot better,” Pierce said. “We’re putting more pressure on teams, we’re rebounding the ball a lot better, we’re moving the ball, and this is the type of the ball we envisioned when we came together. Hopefully we can keep it going.” The Celtics’ recent success has propelled them to the No. 7 seed in the watered-down East as of Monday night, and has also helped deflect some attention away from their worrisome start so far. Looking old and slow and completely out of sync for most of the season before January, Boston was finding itself with few answers for its growing list of problems. Between their poor play, Rondo’s poor attitude and the recent, familiar trade rumors surrounding the team — the latest involving the Kings’ Demarcus Cousins — the Celtics’ situation had grown tenuous over the last few weeks. Perhaps their only saving grace has been a train wreck of a Lakers team that has stolen most of the negative press that would have normally descended upon Boston. The heat won’t be totally off the Celtics unless they can continue to play like the team that we’ve come to expect over the years, but this week’s brief reprieve may be helpful on many levels going forward. “It’s what we can be but it’s not what we’ve been, and that’s what I’ve been saying,” Rivers said when asked if Monday’s performance met his expectations for his club. “We can be better, but it’s a start.” Anthony, meanwhile, didn’t get to finish what he apparently intended to start on Monday, but he’ll certainly get his chance on Jan. 24, when the teams meet again at Madison Square Garden. “In the heat of the battle, man, guys go back and forth,” Garnett said. “(Anthony is) trying to get his team to go, I’m trying to get my team to go. Both teams are colliding, not to mention it’s the Knicks and the Celtics.” Added Rivers: “There’s nothing wrong with getting heated, it happens. It’s just a fun game, it’s competitive, it’s rough at times, and that’s good. I think all that’s good. It shouldn’t ever carry over past that — I’ve had my moments as a player, as well — and it does, but you don’t want it to.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or email him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data
194,"Billy Witz has contributed to The New York Times and covered a multitude of sporting events. A Tulane University grad, Witz has won Associated Press Sports Editor awards for investigative reporting, feature writing and game stories. He covered the Lakers' every move last season for FOX Sports West. As this NBA season gets set to begin, there might not be any better place than here to measure the difference between the labor-induced hectic, injury-riddled, what’s-going-on-here 2012 season and this season’s expected return to normalcy. The Lakers have snapped out of their malaise — and perhaps their streak of consecutive second-round playoff flameouts — thanks to a star-grabbing offseason. Snatching Dwight Howard and Steve Nash has had a way of energizing the base. And the Clippers, bless their hearts, have slipped into their usual place, the shadows. There does not appear to be a run on Lob City T-shirts, there is no chatter about who owns the town and the transformation that Chris Paul has made has been significant but not quite transcendent. It all appears to be a little quieter, no? “It’s definitely not quiet, not with DJ and Lamar,” Blake Griffin said of DeAndre Jordan, whose game may be maturing faster than his personality, and Lamar Odom, who is trying to regain his mojo — and his game — back where his career started. “Obviously, getting (Paul) last year was one of the biggest stories, as far as transactions go before the season, and there was a lot of hype coming in. But I don’t think we’ve paid attention to it. We’ve been kind of focused on ourselves.” The Clippers’ last season was tumultuous with the trade for Paul, the free-agent signing of Caron Butler, the amnesty claim on Chauncey Billups at the start of the season and a nearly revolving door of players during it. With the condensed schedule leaving almost no time for practice, it all had to come together on the fly. The overhaul of the roster was nearly as drastic this season, with seven new faces. The Clippers are hardly the only team to remake their roster, but, for some, the logic appears reasonable. The Lakers, for example, have acquired pieces that complement one another. The Celtics have filled Ray Allen’s role with Jason Terry and have improved their frontcourt depth drastically with Jeff Green, Darko Milicic, Jared Sullinger and Fab Melo, perhaps creating matchup problems for Miami. The Clippers, though, seem less like a makeover and more like a laboratory experiment. The two biggest gambits are their two biggest additions — Jamal Crawford and Odom. Both are former NBA Sixth Man of the Year winners who could give the Clippers one of the NBA’s most dynamic second units, with havoc-wreaking guard Eric Bledsoe. But what can you count on from Crawford and Odom? Odom, who went into a funk when he was dealt to Dallas last season, proclaimed himself a changed man when he was dealt to the Clippers. He backed out of an invitation to the United States Olympic team camp so he could focus on getting in shape. Then he showed up out of shape and injured his knee. He is unsure when he’ll return. He bristled after sitting out an exhibition win over the Lakers on Wednesday when he was asked if there had been something keeping him from being in shape. “It makes no difference,” he said, before exiting the locker room. Coach Vinny Del Negro said Odom was dealing with personal matters that the club was helping him work through, and that Odom — who could give them a gifted, personal big man that otherwise doesn’t exist behind Jordan and Griffin — is crucial to the team. “We need him, and he knows it,” Del Negro said. “I have all the confidence that he’s doing everything he can to get to the level he needs to be at for us.” Meanwhile, Crawford has drawn criticism since he revealed last week that this was the first offseason during his 13-year career that he spent doing drill work to refine his game. “People acted like I’m laying around on the couch,” said Crawford, 32, who signed a four-year deal. “But I’m in the gym all the time, for like 10 hours a day — that’s how I’ve trained instead of using cones. This year, I did both. Playing the game is different. I know guys who knock down 40 shots in a row in practice, but in games they struggle with their shots.” If the Clippers are fortunate, Crawford’s new-found awareness of the game’s finer points might translate to an improved shot selection and an interest in playing defense. Beyond that there is 40-year-old Grant Hill, who is likely to join the 36-year-old Billups, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, on the bench for the season opener. The one seemingly solid commodity the Clippers picked up is Willie Green, who should give them a dependable shooter and ball mover off the bench. The reality is that if the Clippers do build on the improvement of last season, it will largely come on the backs of their two stars. A year of familiarity with Paul should benefit everyone as should a real training camp. And Griffin’s diligent work on his perimeter game in the offseason made it look Wednesday night as if he and Pau Gasol will be the NBA’s best power forwards, with Kevin Love hurt. Whether Butler shedding 15 pounds will translate to a better second season, whether Jordan has matured enough to finish games and whether Bledsoe’s disruptive defense demands he be on the court are the types of speculative questions — along with the impact of Odom and Crawford — that typically greet the Clippers. Their place in the Western Conference hierarchy may have changed, but by returning to the shadows and crossing their fingers that all the changes work out, not everything that is normal for the Clippers feels so new.",Raw Data
195,"With the NBA trade deadline passing at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday, here are the deals that went down. The Wizards sent Crawford, who has led the team in scoring 17 times this season, to Boston Celtics for center Jason Collins and injured guard Leandro Barbosa at Thursday's trade deadline. The move reunites twin brothers Marcus and Markieff Morris in Phoenix, and Marcus was swapped for Robinson, his former teammate at Kansas. Houston also sent Patterson, Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich (another college teammate of Morris) to Sacramento. The Hawks did not trade forward Josh Smith, the focal point of many rumors leading up to the deadline, but the did make one move, sending guard Anthony Morrow to the Dallas Mavericks for guard-forward Dahntay Jones. Atlanta acquired Morrow from Brooklyn in the big offseason trade that sent Joe Johnson to the Nets. Morrow, slowed by right hip and back injuries, averaged 5.2 points in only 24 games with the Hawks. Jones, in his 10th season, has averaged 3.5 points in 50 games, including 15 starts. His contract expires at the end of the season. The Heat traded center Dexter Pittman and a second-round pick and an undisclosed amount of cash to Memphis for the rights to forward Ricky Sanchez, leaving them with 14 players on guaranteed contracts. For a possible 15th spot, Greg Oden’s agent said his client remains a possibility. A person familiar with the decision says the Golden State Warriors have agreed to separate trades that will send Jeremy Tyler to Atlanta and Charles Jenkins to Philadelphia. The salary-shedding deals allow Golden State to get under the luxury tax. Both players were drafted in the second round by the Warriors in 2011 and have played sparingly this season. The Oklahoma City Thunder unloaded free-agent-to-be Eric Maynor in a trade deadline deal with Portland on Thursday, picking up a trade exception and the rights to Greek forward Georgios Printezis. The Phoenix Suns have traded point guard Sebastian Telfair to the Toronto Raptors for center Hamed Haddadi and a 2014 second-round draft pick.",Raw Data
196,"(CNN) -- Former world number one Justine Henin has ruled herself out of contention to win January's Australian Open, the first grand slam event of the 2011 tennis season. The 28-year-old returned from two years out of the sport to remarkably reach the 2010 final in Melbourne, narrowly losing to Serena Williams in three sets. However, a serious elbow injury curtailed her progress for most of the year and, speaking to journalists ahead of next week's Hopman Cup in Perth, Henin admitted she is a long way short of the fitness required to win a major tournament. ""I hope I can build my condition up this year by playing tournaments and hope to be really ready around June or July, which would be great for me,"" said the Belgian -- a winner of seven grand slam titles during her career, including the 2004 Australian Open. ""My elbow is getting better. It is six months since the injury and I can't say I am 100% yet, but I am working very hard on it and I spend two hours every day on my rehabilitation,"" added Henin. ""Now step by step I can improve, but it will probably take a few more weeks and maybe months before I can be 100%. I am not feeling free of all the pain, but I am going in the right direction."" Henin is currently ranked 12th in the world, despite not playing since losing to compatriot Kim Clijsters at Wimbledon in June, and her appearance in the mixed-team Hopman Cup event will mark her return to competitive action. And, despite being nowhere near her optimum fitness, Henin also admitted that holder Williams' absence throws the tournament wide open. ""Nobody is dominating women's tennis, Serena is not going to be there so the event is going to be wide open -- but I don't consider myself one of the favorites to win,"" she added. ""The first round is going to be important for me and then we'll see, step by step. Kim Clijsters proved it at the U.S. Open, and I proved it at Melbourne, that a comeback can be a realistic aim.""",Raw Data
197,"Didier Drogba is teaming up with Wesley Sneijder at Galatasaray, giving the Turkish club a second major signing in a week and boosting its chances of making deep run in the Champions League. Galatasaray announced on its website Monday that Drogba had agreed to an 18-month deal, cutting short his stint in China where he had been playing for Shanghai Shenhua since leaving Chelsea after last season. It's a second major coup for Galatasaray after Sneijder completed his move from Inter Milan last week, as the Turkish club has now made arguably the two biggest signings of the January transfer window. Drogba is currently with Ivory Coast at the African Cup of Nations in South Africa, but said on Twitter through his PR company that ''I am looking forward to playing in the Champions League again, against the best clubs in Europe.'' Drogba played a key part in Chelsea's run to the Champions League title last season, scoring a late equalizer in the final and then converting the decisive penalty in a shootout against Bayern Munich. ''The opportunity to play for this great club was an offer that I could not turn down,'' Drogba said. His representatives, the Sports PR Company, said he will join up with the Galatasaray squad after the African Cup is over. Galatasaray faces German club Schalke in the round of 16 of the Champions League, with the first leg to be played in Turkey on Feb. 20.

198,"Chuck Daly would say of the great Bad Boys teams that maybe some opponents could stick with his starters, but nobody could play with his bench. This bench Lawrence Frank has put together recently is about as exciting a group as the Pistons have had since that time. Vinnie Johnson led the bench brigade for the Bad Boys and usually had one of the starting guards, Isiah or Joe D, out there with him, and while those two are both Hall of Famers, Vinnie was the catalyst of that group. Depending on who happened to be starting at the time – and for much of the time it was Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn and Adrian Dantley followed by Mark Aguirre – think about the group coming off the bench. Along with Vinnie, you had Dennis Rodman, John Salley and James Edwards. I think this bench is reminiscent of that group. There are a couple of reasons why this happens. No. 1, you have to have talent, but No. 2, you also have to be able to play together and this group certainly does that. You also have to remember, a lot of times they’re not playing against starters and you can take advantage of that fact when most of your bench could be starters. Lawrence Frank has said often that on this team, there’s not that much difference between some of the guys who start and those who come off the bench – or even beyond that, to some of the guys not currently in the rotation. It’s often about how players fit together and seeing what works. I really believe you have to give Will Bynum all the credit in the world for the way this group plays. I’ve always been an admirer, always loved his game. When he gets minutes, Will usually makes good things happen. Just as Vinnie was the catalyst for the Bad Boys, Will Bynum is the catalyst for this group. As Greg Kelser said on our telecast during the win over Sacramento, they play at this pace. They play his game. He sets them all up. He was the first to give Andre Drummond lob dunks and now those guys are so connected, I think when Andre’s not in the game or Will’s not in the game they need a tranquilizer, they play so well together. When you look at what Charlie V and Austin Daye have been able to do from long range, and Rodney Stuckey before he sprained his ankle – we all know how explosive he can be – I love this group. This bench is more explosive and more dangerous when Rodney is on the court. Don’t take anything away from Rodney, but since he’s been hurt it’s almost like the bench hasn’t missed a beat and I think that goes back to Will Bynum. He’s the guy with the basketball in his hands for the most part with this group. Look at his productivity in the Sacramento game – 15 points and four assists in 21 minutes, but even that doesn’t really tell the story. His idea, I believe, is No. 1 he wants to set up his teammates but he wants to set them up for sure things. What he really wants is to get a guy a lob dunk and if you’re got Andre Drummond on the floor, there’s a good chance that can happen. Second of all, he knows he’s quicker than whoever’s trying to guard him and he can get by him and get his own shot. If you empower a player like that, just as Lawrence Frank has, it makes the opponent crazy. There’s really not much they can do with a guy like that but hope he misses. Will’s going to miss some shots and take some that maybe he’d like to have back, but not very often. When you talk about the way this bench plays, it’s kind of like what came first – the chicken or the egg? If you penetrate and draw the defense in, then it gives the guys who spot up on the wings and behind the 3-point line wide-open shots and these guys are great 3-point shooters. Everybody’s a little better when nobody’s in their face. When Charlie V and Austin are making shots, players tend to try to go out and play them a little harder, which opens up the lanes for guys like Will and Rodney to get to the basket and finish or find Andre for a lob dunk. This is almost the perfect storm. If you talk to most coaches in the Eastern Conference, they would tell you to watch out for Detroit. The Pistons were never as bad as their record. Their point differential is amazingly good for a team 10 games below .500 and they’re coming on strong. They just needed something to get them going and the bench has been that something. I think our fans are going to enjoy this. What we thought before the season was that, one way or another, this team would at least be in the hunt for a playoff spot. Would we have predicted what happened? Of course not. But based upon the almost ridiculous early schedule and now the schedule softening up a little bit and the way the bench is exploding, the turnaround is now not just under way, they’re in high gear. They’re coming full force. Related Articles: George Blaha",Raw Data
199,"His induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame was one of three wonderful things that happened for Mr. Davidson in his last year. For more than half of my life, I’ve worked for Mr. Davidson, the great, great Pistons owner who died last week and took the air out of the room for the entire Pistons family and great Pistons fans everywhere. He and the Pistons took a chance on a young broadcaster back in 1976 and they’ve allowed me to do what I love to do ever since. I don’t know how you could ever try to repay that debt, other than to thank him as I so often did in the past and to thank his family and all his associates for allowing me to broadcast the team’s games night in and night out for all these years. Bill Davidson was truly everyday people 24-7-365, yet he had the brilliance to dream big and the will to carry it through to fruition. He always looked for the best in his friends, his employees, and probably even in his competitors, if the truth be told. But as ordinary as he acted, he was an extraordinary guy. You don’t do what he has done in the business world without a razor-sharp mind. And above and beyond all of that, if we could quantify it – and I’m not sure we ever will be able to – what he’s done as a philanthropist for not only organizations with a worldwide scope, but also for individuals, we might be able to prove he’s the most generous guy ever in our area and in our state. That’s an unbelievable quality. Nobody expects wealthy people to go out of their way to give away their money and that’s exactly what he did. There was a great connection between Mr. Davidson and his players as far back as my first few years with the team. They were in awe of him, in many ways, because of what he had accomplished, but also because of his down-to-earth, friendly personality. It didn’t take anybody long to understand that he really cared about the people and the players in his organization. I remember Bob Lanier telling me how much they had shared personally, as friends. I know how much Dave Bing respected Mr. Davidson. Those are the two greatest players during his early years as owner. After that, there were strong friendships with Isiah and Joe Dumars and many others, but to bring this right into our living rooms today, the current Detroit Pistons felt a kindship with Mr. D, as they called him, because of the time they spent with him in the practice facility – and he was in there at least five days a week, keeping himself in shape and talking to them, not just about basketball but about their families and their friends. And I think when Rip Hamilton scrawled on his shoes, “We miss you, Mr. D,” that really said it all. It’s 2009. Mr. Davidson was 86 years old when he passed away and here’s Rip Hamilton, a young guy barely 30, more than half a century his junior, but old enough and wise enough to know what a friend he had lost. That speaks volumes not only about Rip, but also about Mr. Davidson. I was just thinking about something this morning – that three wonderful things happened for Mr. Davidson in his last year. It started with our 50th anniversary celebration for the Pistons last spring and it allowed him to renew old acquaintances with some of his greatest players. They had the chance to chat and socialize with him and he hung out with the guys – because, after all, he truly was one of the guys. It was at least as much fun for them as it was for him. And then we had The Palace’s 20th anniversary last summer and we were all able to reminisce with him about all the successes there have been with regard to this building – a building some people really didn’t believe he should build in the first place. Certainly, it stands as one shining moment to a great man’s foresight. And then came the ultimate honor for anyone involved in the game of basketball – enshrinement in the Hall of Fame. There couldn’t be a more deserving owner when it comes to Hall of Fame credentials. Everybody in basketball – and I was lucky enough to be there that night – that I saw was truly happy for Mr. Davidson and felt the honor was long overdue. That’s an amazing chain of events that I’m so glad he got to experience in the last year of his life. We didn’t want to bid adieu to Mr. D, but if we had to, that was the right way for him to go out.",Raw Data

Kapler sat out 2007 and played for three more seasons after joining the Brewers in ’08. Edmonds sat out ’09 and played well enough for the Brewers in ’10 to get traded to the Cincinnati Reds before he again retired. Crosby, the 2004 American League Rookie of the Year, likely will serve as a backup to shortstop Jean Seguar. He also has played all three other infield positions, though sparingly, in his eight-year career. His major-league salary will be $800,000 if he makes the club, according to a major-league source. Crosby also can earn an additional $450,000 in incentives, the source said.",Raw Data

204,"Dwain Chambers has been selected for Great Britain's European Indoor Championships squad despite an underwhelming performance on his return from injury. The former European 60m champion, who won silver in Paris two years ago, has been struggling with a back problem and missed the trials in Sheffield before finishing fifth at the British Athletics Grand Prix in Birmingham. The 34-year-old, who ran a season's best 6.58sec to beat Kim Collins of St Kitts & Nevis and American Mike Rodgers in Glasgow in January, admitted that he did not want to take part in March's championships in Gothenburg if he was not fully fit. But he has now been included in head coach Peter Eriksson's team, which will be captained by defending 800m champion Jenny Meadows, who qualified on her return in Birmingham after 16 months on the sidelines. ""It's a great honour to be named captain of the GB & NI team,"" Meadows said. ""I'm really excited to be given the opportunity to follow Helen Clitheroe, who did such a brilliant job in Paris two years ago."" Great Britain won eight medals at the European Indoors two years ago and Eriksson is targeting a similar haul when the championships start on March 1. ""I have been really encouraged by the performances so far by the team in 2013, and I'm sure this will continue at the European Indoors,"" he said. ""Jenny has shown that she is a very strong character, with great leadership qualities and experience on this stage - she will be a great captain for the GB & NI team."" Olympic high jump bronze Robbie Grabarz will bid to add to his European outdoors bronze medal from 2012, while pole vaulter Holly Bleasdale arrives as the world No. 1 after an impressive start to the year.

205,"Crosby and Malkin made pretty moves to beat Craig Anderson in the shootout and give Pittsburgh a 2-1 victory against the Ottawa Senators on Sunday. James Neal scored in regulation and had the first goal in the shootout to help the Penguins snap a two-game skid. ''We obviously didn't want to keep sliding,'' Crosby. ''Every game is so important. It wasn't a pretty one but it was good we were able to find a way.'' Colin Greening scored a second-period goal for the Senators, and Jason Spezza and Kyle Turris beat Marc-Andre Fleury in the shootout. But Milan Michalek was stopped with Ottawa's first attempt. ''Fleury was big for us tonight,'' said Neal. Anderson made 33 saves for the Senators, while Fleury stopped 31 shots. ''It was a little sloppy at times, but you've got to win them like that,'' said Neal. ''It's going to be like that at times this year.'' The Senators had an opportunity to win in regulation when Erik Karlsson's slap shot from the slot sailed just wide of Fleury with less than 40 seconds to play. ''The puck was bouncing a bit and I couldn't really settle it,'' Karlsson said. ''I just tried to whack it and it didn't work out.'' Jakob Silfverberg had a chance in overtime for the Senators, but after stealing the puck at his own blue-line from Chris Kunitz, he was tracked down on a breakaway by Ben Lovejoy before he was able to get a shot off. Greening's first goal of the season for the Senators at 13:44 of the second came after miscues from both teams. Spezza had the puck in the Penguins' end and although his shot was stopped by Fleury, Greening was there for the rebound and he tucked it in from along the goal line. ''I really enjoyed the game and I feel everyone played well,'' Senators coach Paul MacLean said. ''We got a point out of the game which is real important and we played well enough that we deserved a point and we were pleased with how we were able to be consistent throughout the game. ''I thought the game was very well played by both teams, we traded some opportunities here and there and I thought both goalies played well.'' Neal's one-timer at 13:31 came after a cross-ice pass from Malkin, who has five assists this season. Notes: Anderson has played 298 career games in the NHL and should play No. 300 at home against the Montreal Canadiens Wednesday. ... Malkin's first-period assist tied him with Rick Kehoe for seventh place on the franchise's all-time assist list with 324.",Raw Data
206,"Duncan wasn't chosen last year for the first time in his career but has bounced back with a terrific season at age 36, averaging 17.5 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2.7 blocked shots, his best statistics since 2009-10. The co-MVP of the 2000 All-Star game joined a group that includes Michael Jordan for fifth-most selections. Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett, both voted to start, and Shaquille O'Neal all were picked 15 times. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the career leader as a 19-time All-Star. The reserves were voted by the head coaches from each conference, who had to select two guards, three frontcourt players and two players regardless of position. They were not allowed to vote for players from their own teams. With centers Chandler and Noah, East coaches passed on Brooklyn's Brook Lopez, the leading scorer for a resurgent team that is right behind the Knicks for the Atlantic Division lead. Perennial All-Stars Deron Williams and Joe Johnson of the Nets also missed out, as did Boston's Paul Pierce. Lee gave the Warriors their first All-Star since Latrell Sprewell in 1997, but coach Mark Jackson and his team hoped for more. However, Stephen Curry wasn't selected despite averaging 20.9 points. He's the league's eighth-leading scorer and the highest one who won't be in Houston for the Feb. 17 showcase. Lee called his selection ''bittersweet'' because Curry - the first person to send him a congratulatory text - wasn't picked. ''In our practice facility, there's that All-Star chart and it stops at '97 and there hasn't been any since. So the whole team was really excited with the improved record this year and to get one or both of our guys on there,'' Lee said. ''I'm really excited to be the one that goes and represents our team. I wish Steph could be a part of it and maybe he'll still be able to. I'm just very, very excited. It's been a long time for the Bay Area fans. Not only to have an All-Star, but to be winning games.'' Voted as East starters by fan voting along with Garnett were Miami's LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, New York's Carmelo Anthony and Boston's Rajon Rondo. The West starting five is Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard of the Lakers, Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant, and Clippers teammates Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. The Clippers were hoping for a third All-Star, but sixth-man Jamal Crawford wasn't picked. Commissioner David Stern would choose the replacement if any players are injured. Randolph leads the NBA with 27 double-doubles and becomes the first Grizzlies player with multiple selections. ''It is truly an honor to be named by the NBA's coaches to the 2013 Western Conference All-Star team,'' he said in a statement. ''I am grateful for this opportunity and look forward to playing with the best players in the world.'' The leaders of the teams with the best winning percentage in their conference through games of Feb. 3 will be the coaches. Miami's Erik Spoelstra has the inside track on the East spot, while San Antonio's Gregg Popovich and the Clippers' Vinny Del Negro are battling for the West honor since Scott Brooks, whose Thunder have the league's best record, is ineligible after coaching last year. Irving, the reigning Rookie of the Year, and Holiday were rewarded for outstanding individual seasons even though their teams are well below .500. Irving is the Cavaliers' first All-Star since James, the only other East player averaging at least 20 points and five assists. ''It's one of the best days of my life,'' Irving said Thursday night, shortly after also being honored as Cleveland's professional athlete of the year award at the Greater Cleveland Sports Awards. ''It's a big deal for me and it's a big deal for the city of Cleveland to be picked as an All-Star for the first time. I'm turning 21 on March 23 and to be with those guys, to see those names on TV, that was truly a blessing.'' The 22-year-old Holiday, the youngest All-Star in franchise history, is averaging 19.0 points and 9.0 assists but feared the 76ers' 17-25 mark would work against him. ''I thought so. I definitely thought so. I think anybody else probably would, too,'' he said while watching a Philadelphia Flyers game. ''We're not getting on a winning streak or anything like that. I just tried to stay positive and not talk about it.''",Raw Data

208,"﻿NASCAR’s two biggest names — Earnhardt and Petty — are partnering to promote Goody’s Headache Powders. Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was named NASCAR’s Most Popular Driver for the 10th consecutive season, hopes to unite the sport’s younger fan base with the core traditional supporters of seven-time champion Richard Petty. The King has been a spokesman for Goody’s since 1977, when the brand became the sport’s first non-automotive backer. Goody’s remains one of the longest sponsor relationships in NASCAR. “This partnership is unprecedented,” said Joseph Juliano, brand director at Goody’s. “It is the first time that these two NASCAR legends have worked together. Each of them has a huge fan base, and they are both synonymous with the sport of auto racing. Goody’s is all about speed, and nobody personifies the idea of speed better than Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr.” The campaign kicks off during the first quarter of 2013. Goody’s will also continue to be the title sponsor of the fall Sprint Cup race at Martinsville Speedway, to be raced on Oct. 27 this season. “I am really looking forward to working with Dale Jr. on the new campaign for Goody’s, which will introduce the product to a whole new generation,” Petty said. “He is a great driver and a smart businessman, and nobody is more popular with NASCAR fans.” TRUE TEST NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers tried out the new-model car at Daytona. Take a look! Earnhardt, who considers himself a historian of the sport, was tickled to be aligned with The King and Goody’s. The third-generation racer says some of his earliest memories at the track were of Petty and the popular headache powders. “Richard Petty is a role model for me and every other driver in NASCAR,” Earnhardt said. “I am honored to be working with him and thankful Goody’s brought us together. I signed on with Goody’s in part because of their long-term commitment to NASCAR. They helped start the trend of non-car companies coming into the sport. In my mind, they are synonymous with NASCAR racing. I am also a big fan of their product because it works so fast.”",Raw Data

210,"A Chelsea offer would be hard to resist for the boss who has been LMA Manager of the Year on three occasions while operating on a restricted budget at Everton. DAVID MOYES is emerging as a genuine candidate to become manager of Chelsea in the summer. Rafa Benitez, Chelseas interim boss until the end of the season, is not wanted by the Stamford Bridge fans. And if Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich looks elsewhere for his next manager, Evertons Moyes will be in the frame to become the Russians first British boss. Moyes, 49, would be a contender, along with Borussia Dortmunds Jurgen Klopp and possibly Real Madrids former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. His Goodison contract is up at the end of the season and Moyes has to decide whether to continue his 11-year relationship with the club  or make a career-changing decision. Moyes has revealed he has ambitions to manage in Germanys Bundesliga one day  but it could be a case first of London calling. The Everton boss enjoys a special relationship with Goodison chairman Bill Kenwright which would be difficult to end.

Former Toffees star Stubbs, now a reserve team coach at the club, said: The manager has got his destiny in his own hands now. Hes done a fantastic job. Hes basically irreplaceable  but hes probably looking at his career and looking for that next challenge.",Raw Data
211,"Brad Keselowski is going to enjoy this NASCAR Sprint Cup championship. WHAT A DAY! Brad Keselowski won the title but how did the rest of the Chase field end up? NASCAR Standings I think hes going to represent our sport well as the champion. Hes going to bring a new, renewed interest in our sport because he is only 28 years old. Not to take anything away from recent champions Tony Stewart or Jimmie Johnson, theyve been awesome ambassadors as champions of our sport for the last seven years, but I just think Brad attracts a younger demographic which is what were truly trying to get back engaged with our sport. I see these guys enjoying it, but I see then going right back to work pretty hard. Theyve obviously got a pretty major undertaking in trying to win their second consecutive title. Like everybody else in the Cup series, theyve got a major body change, and that kind of gives everybody a clean sheet of paper and everybodys got a lot of work to do. Then, of course, theyre making the transition from Dodge to Ford. I dont think thats going to be that big of a deal for them, especially - I thought it was a brilliant move for Penske right now, it may not be long term since theyve elected to go to Roush Yates for their engines. Thats already an established engine company that wins races and wins championships. I think that transition, especially since weve got a new body stryle regardless, puts them on a much more even keel. I see no reason why they cannot repeat as champion. PARTY TIME Go along for the ride as Brad Keselowski celebrates being champ. Every year, a season ends and we start to make our predictions. Our predictions are truly only based off of what we know to that point. Did we have any reason to believe that the two guys that battled in 2011 to the bitter end would not be championship contenders in 2012? Lets face it, Tony Stewart won five races of the 10 in the Chase. Carl Edwards was a model of consistency battling Tony to the bitter end. And then those two guys were really not players this year. Tony won his three races, but he was absolutely never a factor in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. And Carl Edwards didnt even make the Chase. Did we ever believe that Brad Keselowski and Paul Wolfe, in only their second season together in Cup and only Keselowski's third season in the series, did we ever believe they were going to win this championship? We felt they were going to run well, but Im not sure we picked them as championship contenders. Would we have ever believed that Clint Bowyer, going to a brand-new organization, a brand-new race team and Micahel Waltrip Racing as a whole, since they started in 2007 not really making a lot of noise in the sport, did we ever believe they would be contenders wining three races and finishing second in the points? So I guess we sit here today and say it looks like it will be Keselowski, Bowyer, Jimmie Johnson, the five that finished at the top of the heap this year, contending for the title but I can almost guarantee you there will be some new players next year just like there were this year.",Raw Data

""We saw today the tyres were going off pretty quickly, they didn't last a few laps,"" he said. ""But you have to be careful because it is too cold, as simple as that. We still want to understand the tyres but in these conditions it's tricky, everyone is suffering the same problems.""

214,"Editor’s note: for the first time ever, FOX Soccer has named only one person as the USA Player of the Year. Normally, this award is given to a deserving U.S.-based male athlete and a U.S.-based female athlete. But this season, the accomplishments of the gold-medal winning women so overshadowed the performances of even the best male contenders, the editors felt it would be unfair not to recognize those achievements. As such: we congratulate Alex Morgan and the entire U.S. Women’s National Team. Morgan becomes the first ever solo winner of the USA Player of the Year award. Alex Morgan wasn’t supposed to become a soccer star. Just as soon as she could catch things, when she was 3 years old, her baseball-loving father Mike signed her up for softball. ""He really pushed softball on me,"" Morgan said. ""Finally, I told him, 'You know what, Dad? I don’t like softball. I like soccer. I like to run'"". So Mike, who owns a construction company in Southern California, took soccer coaching and refereeing lessons. And he hasn’t missed a soccer game of hers in as long as she can remember, including all 58 of her national team games, her college games and her high school games. Yet whereas her fellow national team heroines Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe trod a familiar path to stardom, being discovered very young, sacrificing and spending untold hours in the car in search of quality coaching and competition, Morgan almost fell into it. Her becoming one of the new faces of the U.S. women’s national team, not to mention U.S. Soccer’s Female Athlete of the Year, is mostly accidental. ""My life didn’t revolve around soccer at all when I was younger,"" recalls Morgan. ""It was very different from most people in my position. Yes, it was a dream from when I was a young girl that I wanted to be a professional athlete but I was never playing at a high level."" For all his enthusiasm, her father never pressurized her into taking sports seriously, and neither did her mother. They didn’t seek out elite travel teams, private coaching or push her to find tougher games. In addition to soccer and softball, Morgan played basketball and was on her high school volleyball and cross country team. She wasn’t even sure which she liked best. She had fanciful ideas about a life in sports, but didn’t pursue it actively. ""I saw that potential but did everyone else? Not really,"" she says. ""It was more about the fun,"" says Morgan. ""It wasn’t about what can I do to take the next step in this sport."" She was working on her craft unintentionally though. Three or four times a week, Alex and Mike would find a goal and he would play in goal so she could shoot. ""But I didn’t do that because I thought that I could make more of an impact on my team but because I loved it, it was fun for me and what I wanted to do after school,"" she says. There were sleepovers and friends, the social life precluded by the serious pursuit of professionalism. See how the United States performed in their gold medal win over Japan. She’d only been playing competitive club soccer for a few years, previously enrolling in the much less formal American Youth Soccer Organization, before she was called into the under-20 national team around her 18th birthday. And then Cal-Berkeley happened and the senior national team happened and the number one overall pick in the 2011 WPS draft happened. And then, at 23, Morgan broke out. In 2012, the women’s national team had another torrid year, posting a 28-1-3 (W-L-T) record while winning a third consecutive Olympic gold medal. Morgan scored 28 times and gave 21 assists. The former made her the youngest ever to break the 20-goal barrier for the U.S.; the latter was just one short of Mia Hamm’s single-year record set in 2004. Hamm was also the only other U.S. player to ever go 20-and-20 in one year. Morgan didn’t know that. And, by herself, she comfortably out-scored and out-assisted her opponents, who combined for 21 goals and 12 assists in 32 games against the U.S. ""Really?"" exclaims Morgan when I tell her. She didn’t know that either. She’s speechless for a few beats. USA star Alex Morgan is a heart-breaker on and off the field. See why. ""Looking back, it’s amazing to look at the stats,"" Morgan says, at length. ""I don’t know that I dreamt of making those numbers."" Nor had she expected them. She was a substitute at the 2011 Women’s World Cup, where she seemed to have scored the World Cup-winning goal before Japan equalized and won the final on penalties. Morgan didn’t become a starter for the U.S. until the fifth game of the year back in January, the final of the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament. She scored twice that day, as did Wambach, in a 4-0 win over the Canadian hosts. The partnership was never broken up. ""To be able to get into the starting lineup, that was my hope,"" Morgan says of her mindset going into 2012. ""Did I think, realistically, it was going to happen as soon as it did? I’m not sure."" Suddenly, she’s the heir apparent to Wambach as the team’s star striker, slotting into a direct line of succession from Michelle Akers through Hamm and Wambach. Wambach, in fact, thinks Morgan will break the all-time U.S. goal-scoring record (which, too, is a record in all international soccer, for both men and women) she herself is on the precipice of setting – she’s six goals behind Mia Hamm’s 158 – and tells her as much. Click here for Abby Wambach's best momemts from her illustrious career. ""It was about a year ago,"" recounts Morgan. ""I went up to Abby and said, 'Wow, it must be incredible to have such a goal-to-game ratio and score so many big-time goals.' She laughed a little bit and said, 'You know what? You’re going to score a lot more big-time goals than I do and you’re going to break the record I one day set.'"" Morgan was understandably incredulous. A year on, she credits much of the success she has had since to Wambach’s unrelenting confidence and guidance. They talk often and Wambach sends her reassuring emails when Morgan is in a scoring slump. Wambach mentors Morgan the way she was mentored by Hamm. In that relationship, the mentee eventually usurped the mentor. Morgan could do the same. At 38 goals in less than three years since her March 2010 debut, there’s much scoring to be done yet. But to put into perspective the freakishness of the goalscoring pace Morgan set in 2012, she could eclipse 200 career goals in just six more years – by age 29 – if she keeps it up. It took Hamm 17 years to get to 158. But that’s only if Morgan can replicate the year she had in 2012. And that could hardly happen by accident.

215,"Itd be tough to say that the defending Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings are still the NHLs best team. On Sunday, the Chicago Blackhawks defeated them for the second time this season (2-0). Just like they did on January 19th, the Blackhawks dominated most of the game against the Kings on national television, looking like the all-around better team with the nations eyes upon them. But that would all be a small side note if it werent for one main factor Chicago is undefeated. Thats right, un-de-feat-ed. And thats not something you can say very often. Back in 2006, the Anaheim Ducks didnt lose a game in regulation (different than winning every game) through their first 16 matchups, an NHL record. The Blackhawks are now in 2nd place on that all-time list, not having lost through their first 15 games (12-0-3) with a chance to tie the Ducks record on Tuesday night against the very capable Vancouver Canucks. But whether Chicago ties the record, edges it out, blows it away, or doesnt reach it at all is not what I want our current topic of discussion to be. The team will be sure to get a lot of coverage going forward, and deservingly so. Its probably even fair to say that theyll be one of, if not the absolute favorite to win the Stanley Cup until their season is done or until they do indeed hoist the prestigious trophy. Its time to give respect to the two young stars that are the driving forces behind this Chicago team and although theyre both only 24 years of age, they are already in their sixth season as difference-makers at the United Center. Its Captain and Kaners Time to Shine Again Jonathan Toews, the 3rd overall draft pick out of the University of North Dakota in 2006 has not disappointed while serving as the Blackhawks captain. So far, the youngster has 337 points to his name (goals + assists), which is an average of just under 1 per game. His best statistical season came in 2010-2011 when he had 76 points (32 goals, 44 assists), though hes just now entering the prime of his career. Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews is one of the main reasons for the teams success this season. (Photo by Matt Boulton via CC BY-SA 2.0) Patrick Kane was selected 1st overall by the Blackhawks in the 2007 draft, and had his best campaign in 2009-2010 when he had 88 points (30 goals, 58 assists). Like Toews, he also averages just under 1 point per game throughout his career (390 points total). He too obviously is expected to be entering his prime just now, as it appears he may be on pace to have his best season yet in 2013 (21 points through 14 games). Both Toews and Kanes names have been very recognizable ones for a few years already, but it looks like theyre now poised to join the upper-echelon and become full-blown superstars. Considering they play in a major city, for a city that loves their team, with big-time media support behind them, if they can keep pace with the high-level of play theyve become accustomed to, they may reach those heights sooner rather than later. And I cant make it clear enough they already deserve it. The 2009-10 NHL season ended with the Blackhawks raising the Stanley Cup trophy, led by playoffs MVP (Conn Smythe Trophy recipient) Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, who knocked in the series-clinching goal in walk-off fashion. Although they were only 22 and 21 years old respectively, it was clearly their time to shine. Since then, the Blackhawks teams havent been quite as good due to being put in a tough financial situation after winning the Cup. Plus, Toews has battled injuries, and Kane has battled immaturity issues, but as Ive mentioned already, the time is now. Although veterans like Marian Hossa, Patrick Sharp, and Duncan Keith are still in town and the Hawks getting superb goalie play from Corey Crawford and Ray Emery, its been Toews and Kane leading the way to the teams 12-0-3 start. Kane and his 21 points are currently tied for 2nd in the NHL in points behind only Buffalos Thomas Vanek. Toews leadership has also been key, as his 9 +/- rating has him just outside of the leagues top 10. Luckily for Chicago fans, the teams depth should be able to keep their stars fresh, as the team has nobody in the NHLs top 30 time on ice per game category. So, What? It takes a lot for NHL stars to be anywhere near the popularity level of the big names from other sports. Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkins stardom level are the biggest any recent stars have gotten in the past several years, and although that level may be tough for Toews and Kane to reach, they really are doing all they can to get there. Considering how young, deep, and talented the Blackhawks are, its not ridiculous to assume they win another Stanley Cup within the next 2-3 years. If they do, led by Toews and Kane, Chicago will have their next big stars to share the stage with the Bulls Derrick Rose. And that is something to get excited about whether youre a hockey or Chicago fan or not. Theres nothing more enjoyable, from a sports consumers perspective, than watching young stars flourish, and thats exactly whats happening right now in the Madhouse on Madison.",Raw Data
216,"Jason Whitlock writes about the sports world from every angle, including those other writers can't imagine or muster courage to address. His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. Here’s what Clark Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, does not understand about his general manager, Scott Pioli: His massive ego is born of insecurity and most effectively used as a shield for his deceit. Pioli is a swindler. Pride and vanity will not push Pioli into forfeiting the millions of dollars he apparently suckered Hunt into promising him in the form of a contract extension. Pioli can’t be shamed. Con men think little of themselves and care even less what others think of them. Hunt fired Pioli’s overmatched, handpicked coach Romeo Crennel and then — with a devastating written statement, an online video posted on the Chiefs website and several print and radio interviews — Hunt publicly announced he was stripping Pioli of virtually all his power. “I will hire the next coach of the Kansas City Chiefs and he will report directly to me,” Hunt told members of the Kansas City media. “It gives us the best chance of hiring the most outstanding coach.” There it is. In terms of power, Pioli has been reduced to his former size. He’s back in the role he played for Bill Belichick in New England: behind-the-scenes puppet. Pioli will not leave. No other organization will elevate him to the perch he enjoyed for four years in Kansas City. And certainly no other organization will make him one of the highest-paid executives in the NFL. The jig is up. Pioli bamboozled Hunt and the NFL media, including yours truly, into believing he was the Belichick of executives. He milked his hustle into a magnificent payday. Hunt would love nothing more than to shame Pioli into begging his father-in-law, Dollar Bill Parcells, to find him another job. That’s the only reasonable explanation for pulling Pioli’s pants down in such a public fashion. Pioli’s status for next season is yet to be determined. Hunt said in an interview with KC Star beat writer Adam Teicher that Pioli’s fate might not be decided until early February. Pioli is a laughingstock — except on payday. The problem for Hunt is Parcells taught Pioli that “you are what your pay stub says you are.” Pioli ain’t going over any fiscal cliff. He’s not leaving KC without his money. Hunt should give it to him and be done. The best chance of hiring the most outstanding coach comes with Pioli in a different zip code. Why would any highly qualified coach want to participate in the Chiefs' dysfunction? Why would any highly qualified coach want Pioli leading and/or participating in draft and free-agent preparations? Admitting a mistake is clearly the most difficult task in American culture. Too many Americans view admitting a mistake as a sign of weakness. It is not. It’s a sign of strength, a sign of maturity and confidence. Clark Hunt and Pioli’s groupies in the media need to acknowledge they were wrong about Pioli. I jumped ship four or five months into his Kansas City reign. The contract he gave Matt Cassel was ridiculous given his highly suspicious resume. The way he treated Pro Bowl guard Brian Waters upon introduction was grade-school bully-ish. And Pioli’s insecurity-fueled ego reared its head in a major way during a get-to-know-you dinner with selected members of the print media. I don’t mind being wrong. I was wrong about Pioli. In the six months before landing the KC job, he charmed me much the same way I suspect he charmed other members of the media he thought could fan the flames of the Scott Pioli myth. It’s clear he’s a fraud. His draft picks have been mostly disastrous. His four first-round picks — Tyson Jackson, Eric Berry, Jonathan Baldwin and Dontari Poe — are either busts or underachievers. Yep, I know Berry made the Pro Bowl. But if you’ve ever watched Berry play pass defense, you know he has no business in the Pro Bowl. Pioli whiffed on both coaches he chose. Todd Haley was an immature hothead. Romeo Crennel was Romeo Crennel, another Belichick myth. If Pioli has a successful free-agent or trade acquisition, I can’t name him. The Chiefs just completed the worst season in franchise history. They went eight weeks without leading a game. Pioli built the Titanic. What value does Pioli bring a new coach? Bill Cowher and Jon Gruden can hire their own flunkies. It’s my belief that Notre Dame’s Brian Kelly is the best NFL coaching candidate on the market. It’s remarkable what he’s done at Notre Dame. I don’t mean this as an insult, but I don’t see Kelly as a “molder of men.” The Declan Sullivan/scissor lift tragedy told me all I need to know about Kelly as a college coach. He’s a mercenary focused on one thing — winning games. Kelly is a guy who loves football. He’s meant to coach in the NFL. He reminds me of Jim Harbaugh. Kelly will tone down his sideline rants in the NFL. But Scott Pioli can’t help Brian Kelly transition to the NFL. Pioli can’t help any college coach transition to the NFL. Retaining Pioli limits Hunt’s options at head coach. Let Pioli walk with his money. Smart people get swindled from time to time. A bought lesson rarely goes unlearned. It’s the mistakes that go unpunished that we most often repeat.",Raw Data
217,"Im sorry, its not a calamity. Not even close. HALL'S FAIR Ken Rosenthal says it's actually a good thing that nobody was voted into the HOF this year. Many fans were stunned Wednesday by the announcement that the voting members of the Baseball Writers Association of America did not elect anyone to the Hall of Fame not a single player from the most star-studded ballot in recent memory. I sensed this might happen, which is why I wrote a column Monday warning against an overreaction. This is a one-year aberration, largely attributable to the ambivalence of many voters, including myself, about candidates who were linked to steroids. But next year, there will be so many inductees, I fully expect to hear complaints that too many are entering the Hall. Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Frank Thomas are strong first-ballot candidates for the Class of 2014. Former managers Bobby Cox, Joe Torre and Tony La Russa will be eligible for induction by the Veterans Committee. And Craig Biggio (68.2 percent) and Jack Morris (67.7) could pick up the 40 or so votes they need to pass the 75 percent threshold. Biggio passed the 3,000 hits milestone, but lets not get too worked up about him falling short Roberto Alomar, the other preeminent second baseman of his era and arguably a better player also failed to make it on his first try. So did two other prominent middle infielders, Barry Larkin and Ryne Sandberg. MORE ON HOF SHUTOUT Scribes pitch shutout | Why? Why I voted for Bonds, Clemens Hall of Famers applaud results Morris down to last chance now Murphy eliminated but thankful Dont forget: A player can remain on the ballot 15 years, as long as he continues to receive a minimum 5 percent of the vote. Biggio will be elected, probably next year. Jeff Bagwell (59.6 percent) and Mike Piazza (57.8 percent) eventually will be enshrined, too. There is no formal evidence that any of them used PEDs. Its just that this year at least, the steroid era was a cloud over the entire ballot. As for Roger Clemens (37.6 percent) and Barry Bonds (36.2), yes, their totals were lower than expected. But did anyone seriously expect them to waltz into Cooperstown, considering their alleged connections to PED use and the intense debate over their candidacies? Sports Illustrateds Tom Verducci, speaking on MLB Network, referred to the days outcome as a deferral, and thats exactly how I see it. Many of us are so conflicted, were unable to say definitively, right now that many of these players belong in the Hall. But is it possible we could change our minds later? Of course. Such shifts in voting patterns drive many fans nuts, but the 15-year grace period gives us time to form new and broader perspectives. The arguments of sabermetricians, for example, helped persuade me that Bert Blyleven was a Hall of Famer. Id rather be adaptable than inflexible, as long as I ultimately get it right. Player Pct. Yrs. on ballot Craig Biggio 68.2 1 Jack Morris 67.7 14 Jeff Bagwell 59.6 3 Mike Piazza 57.8 1 Tim Raines 52.2 6 Lee Smith 47.8 11 Curt Schilling 38.8 1 Roger Clemens 37.6 1 Barry Bonds 36.2 1 Edgar Martinez 35.9 4 Alan Trammell 33.6 12 Larry Walker 21.6 3 Fred McGriff 20.7 4 Dale Murphy 18.6 15 Mark McGwire 16.9 7 Don Mattingly 13.2 13 Sammy Sosa 12.5 1 Rafael Palmiero 8.8 3 BBWAA No doubt, Clemens and Bonds face an uphill battle. I expect that their totals will rise next year; some voters surely did not want to elect them on the first ballot. Yet, its also possible that many voters who oppose Clemens and Bonds will never waver, keeping them far below 75 percent. One thing that concerns me is that our deferral will create more overcrowded ballots, harming deserving candidates. Morris, whom I do not vote for, could be the first victim; he gained only 1 percent from 2012 to 13, and next year is his last year of eligibility. Four players I do vote for Tim Raines (52.2 percent), Lee Smith (47.8), Alan Trammell (33.6) and Fred McGriff (20.7) all lost support this time. It will only get more difficult for such players. Not only is the 2014 ballot stacked, but Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz will be first-time candidates in 15, Ken Griffey Jr. and Trevor Hoffman in 16, Vlad Guerrero, Jorge Posada, Manny Ramirez and Pudge Rodriguez in 17. My colleague Jon Paul Morosi wrote this week that the Hall of Fame and BBWAA should lift the prohibition of voting for more than 10 players. Im not ready to go that far the Veterans Committee exists to rectify any perceived oversights by the BBWAA, and Im not sure the gridlock will be as damaging as some fear. But should we discuss the idea? Absolutely. One thing we definitely need to clean up as suggested by Tyler Kepner of the New York Times is the composition of the voting bloc. The voting should be restricted only to writers who cover the sport regularly. Sports editors and general assignment reporters do not fit that description; nor do writers who have been retired for a certain length of time say, 10 years. Kepner argued that broadcasters, statistical analysts, historians, scouts and executives also should merit a say in the process, but I am certain that the BBWAA would oppose any dilution of its voting rights. Well, if were going to be territorial, we owe the fans, the Hall and the sport the most qualified voting body possible. Beyond that? I still think the process works. Many reacted Wednesday by asking, How could the writers not elect anyone? Fair question, but while the outcome was unusual especially given the quality of the players on this years ballot it was not unprecedented. The BBWAA had thrown such a shutout seven times previously, most recently in 1996. As Hall of Fame president Jeff Idelson said, a single election is merely a snapshot in time. A worthy candidate receives up to 15 chances, long enough for voters to carefully weigh his career, put it in the proper focus. For many of us, that focus this year was elusive. Doesnt mean it will be next year. Doesnt mean it will be forever.",Raw Data
218,"Ideally, the Pro Bowl would be an illusion. It would look and sound like a football game, but would not be an actual, dangerous football game. This is the biggest issue facing the NFL today, primarily because the Super Bowl isn't until next week. The league needs to find a way to make professional football look fast and physical without being fast and physical, and that might not be possible. Sunday's game the NFC won 62-35 was an improvement over last year, but that's kind of like winning the 5k on ""The Biggest Loser."" Last season's game was a watershed moment in Pro Bowl history. For the first time, the players seemed to go out of their way to show they weren't trying. It looked like a silent plea to retire the event. They jogged through enough plays that the NFL this year let the players know if they weren't going to try any harder than that the league might just shut the thing down altogether. Speaking on NBC before the game, Peyton Manning carried some of the NFL's water, saying how enriching the experience had been for him over the years. Not all his peers agree. Presumably healthy players have declined invitations and some who accepted them made it clear they didn't plan on leaving it all out of the field, exactly. ""This isn't basketball,"" Houston Texans running back Arian Foster told the Houston Chronicle. ""You can't go play a pickup game of football. If that's what they expect and they're going to take it away because of that, it's probably going to be what it is. You can't really expect that from guys that play 16-plus games a season and it to be a competitive game."" This would not be much of an issue if the Pro Bowl wasn't popular as a televised event. But the game drew 12.5 million viewers last year. That was down from the year before, but the Pro Bowl was still more popular than the MLB All-Star game, the NBA All-Star game, all but one game of the NBA conference finals and the Stanley Cup Finals. So the Pro Bowl is still good for the bottom line, but that's only part of the question. What if the game reaches a point where its very existence mocks the game it is supposed to be celebrating? Last year's performance hit the bottom of that sinkhole, so the NFL decided this was something that needed to be officially addressed. Publicly airing its concerns about the game let the fans know that the NFL was hearing their complaints. It also signaled that maybe that this was the Pro Bowl's last chance to fake it as a real football game before the NFL pulled the plug on that illusion entirely and turned this into a skills competition or something. That wouldn't bother Foster. ""Something like that,"" Foster told The Chronicle. ""Everybody's all, 'the Pro Bowl's a joke.' I think it's an honor and a tradition. But for you to expect the best athletes in the NFL to come out and play a game 100 percent when you can't game plan, you can't blitz, you can't do all these things, it's just not going to be competitive like everybody wants it to be. We're going to try to step it up a notch this year, but at the end of the day, you're not going to see 100 percent effort out there, it's just not going to happen."" Most observers seemed to agree the players looked like they were trying harder this year than last, but they still weren't fooling anybody. Football can't be played at half-speed. More than any other sport, the speed, power and collisions are essential to the sport's aesthetic appeal. Sunday's Pro Bowl didn't solve that problem, because that problem can't be solved. Whatever happens, it's clear there is an appetite for something football-related the week before the Super Bowl, and considering the maniacal interest in even the most mundane aspects of the game have you seen NFL Network during the Scouting Combine? it seems like a reasonable supposition that some sort of event in which Peyton Manning and Drew Brees throw footballs at disposable targets and Ray Lewis gives a pep talk to a crowd of tackling dummies would have legs. But then again, why change something that's working? Most people would say the MLB All-Star game is more significant (because it decides home-field advantage in the World Series) and the NBA All-Star game is more entertaining (because pick-up basketball between NBA players really is a spectacle). But in terms of measurable popularity, the NFL's all-star game sets the standard. Granted, it helps that football is simply more popular in the United States than baseball or basketball, but the NFL helped create that appetite. We can't blame it for cashing in. We can blame it, however, for trying to tell us this game is something it isn't. You'll probably see some mention of J.J. Watt's bloody hand in the discussion of Sunday's Pro Bowl. It'll be shown as a visual example that these guys really were going after each other. ""They can't say we don't play hard,"" Watt said. Maybe he can tell his teammate, Arian Foster.",Raw Data

220,"There's no shortage of controversy in A-Rod's career. Take a look back at some of his finer moments. Cashman says ''there's no guarantees in this stuff'' that Rodriguez will be able to play this year. The 37-year-old Rodriguez had surgery on his left hip last week. The team said the rehabilitation time was expected to be six months, which would sideline the star slugger until the All-Star break. On Friday, Cashman said it was possible A-Rod could be out all year. ''Yeah,'' Cashman told WFAN radio. ''I think because (of) the serious nature of the surgery and the condition that he's trying to recover from, you know, there is that chance.'' ''I can't say it's not possible that he won't be back,'' he said. The Yankees signed free agent Kevin Youkilis during the offseason to play third base while Rodriguez is out. Cashman said Rodriguez is doing everything ''in his power to put himself in the position to get back and be healthy and productive.'' ''Best case scenario, yeah he should be back,'' Cashman said. ''Worst case scenario, he won't be back, or there might be something in between.'' A 14-time All-Star, Rodriguez hit .272 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs in 122 games last year. The three-time AL MVP was benched in three of nine postseason games and pinch hit for in three others, batting just .120 (3 for 25) with no RBIs in the playoffs. Rodriguez had surgery on Jan. 16 to repair a torn labrum and reshape a bone to alleviate an impingement. He has 647 career homers and is due $114 million over the next five years as part of his record $275 million, 10-year contract.

221,"Indiana coach Lin Dunn criticized the coach of the Minnesota Lynx on Thursday, accusing her of a ''lack of respect'' for an outburst that seemed to spur the Lynx to a win in the WNBA Finals. Dunn said she wasn't amused by Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve's meltdown on Wednesday night. Ignited by Reeve's technical foul and subsequent jacket toss, Minnesota turned up the intensity in the second half to pull away for an 83-71 win in Game 2 to even the series at a game apiece. Game 3 is in Indianapolis on Friday. Dunn said she thought Reeve should have been ejected because the wildest part of the tantrum came after the technical. ''I guess the thing that concerns me is that after she got her first technical, then she proceeded to take her jacket off, throw her jacket,'' Dunn said. ''In my opinion, that should have been reason for a second technical and removal, and they (the officials) did not do that, and of course, she was able to incite the crowd. ''There's no doubt in my mind that her behavior after the first technical warranted ejection, and I was very disappointed that the officials allowed her to in some ways, you know, just kind of a lack of respect for the game and lack of respect for them. I was disappointed in the whole affair.'' After Minnesota's Lindsay Whalen tied Wednesday's game at 48 with a reverse layup, Minnesota's Maya Moore picked up her third foul on the other end. After Whalen's layup was blocked by Briann January, Minnesota's frustrations came out. Whalen was issued a technical foul for complaining about the no-call by official Michael Price, then Price gave Reeve one, too. Reeve took her suit coat off and threw it so hard that she hurt her right shoulder and said she needed to see a trainer after the game. Reeve wasn't available to reporters in Indianapolis on Thursday. Minnesota's Taj McWilliams-Franklin said her coach knew what she was doing. ''She wanted to light a fire under us,'' she said. ''She wanted to light a fire under the refs and everything else and the fans and energize us, which is what she did. She's very calculating in everything she does. You all think she's out of control but she's not, by far.'' Indiana forward Tamika Catchings, who scored 27 points in Game 2, said Reeve's tactics worked. ''I think she was just trying to get her team fired up, and she did a good job in that moment,'' Catchings said. ''It seemed like after that, they really picked it up as a team and all of them played a little more motivated, a lot more physical from that point on.'' Catchings said her team failed to realize the importance of what was happening and didn't respond well. ''For us, we have to use that as a learning curve, too,'' she said. ''I should have pulled everybody over and said, `Now, they're going to start going at us, they're going to start attacking us.''' Dunn also took exception to Reeve's halftime speech, during which she directed her players to use their elbows in the second half. ''When you go to the basket, I want an elbow out,'' Reeve said in a speech that was televised. ''I want them to collapse their arms on you because you're sticking an elbow in their chest.'' Dunn learned of the speech after the game and was shocked. ''I've never heard a coach say that publicly before - lead with your elbow, they're not calling it.'' Both January and Shavonte Zellous had concussions during a game at Minnesota late in the regular season. Now, Dunn wonders if there was intent behind the hits. ''I guess the thing that sticks in my mind now is I look back to those two concussions we had in the game up there that we played in the regular season, and it makes me think, hey, maybe that was attributed to that because that's how they teach their players to play, which I consider very dangerous and shouldn't be part of our game,'' she said. Dunn said Minnesota's elbows and Reeve's outburst didn't cost Indiana Wednesday's game. The Fever were outrebounded 32-20, committed 24 turnovers and let Seimone Augustus score 23 of her 27 points in the second half. ''Just do your job, box out better, don't give so many second-chance points, take care of the basketball and you win the ballgame,'' Dunn said. ''So that's what we're focusing on tomorrow night, is doing the little things like that better.'' Indiana guard Katie Douglas isn't sure if she will play. The Fever's No. 2 scorer sprained her left ankle in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals and missed both Game 1 and Game 2 of the Finals. Douglas said she's dealing with pain and instability and doesn't know how effective she will be if she plays. Indiana reserve guard Jeanette Pohlen left Wednesday's game with an injured left knee. Dunn said she doesn't expect Pohlen to play Friday. Minnesota is at full strength and feeling good after playing its style of game and winning on Wednesday. ''I think for us, the vet team that we have, we can't dwell on anything,'' McWilliams-Franklin said. ''It's about sharpening what we do well, which is what we did. We are a fast breaking team, set up second, and I think we pushed it at them. We were up and aggressive and doing the things that Minnesota Lynx always do.''",Raw Data

""Everyone at the Chargers is in complete shock and disbelief right now,” the Chargers organization said in a statement after Seau's death. “We ask everyone to stop what they're doing and send their prayers to Junior and his family.""

225,"MIAMI — News of Junior Seau’s death hit the Miami Dolphins hard, but the news that Seau’s death is being investigated as an apparent suicide hit even harder. Former Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas said in a statement that Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowl selection, was his “hero.” “You never heard one negative word come out of his mouth,” Thomas said. “Junior just had this energy that followed him around wherever he went, almost like theme music. It was like he never had a bad day.” Former Dolphins wide receiver Oronde Gadsden also cited Seau’s attitude as part of the reason everyone is puzzled by his death. “I talked to the players that keep in touch — Pat Surtain, Sam Madison and Tim Bowens,” Gadsden said. They all recalled Seau’s positive, energetic mindset during his three years with the Dolphins (2003-05). An apparent suicide is hard for them to reconcile. “They don’t mix, it’s like oil and water,” Gadsden said. “Exuberant, and hard-working, great football player, and then a suicide. “You just come to understand you don’t know what’s going on in anybody’s life for real.” Seau, found dead in his Oceanside, Calif., home on Wednesday, started 15 games in the 2003 season, when Miami went 10-6. He had 66 tackles and six sacks. Over the next two years his production dropped dramatically as he only played in 15 games, starting 13. The Dolphins slumped to 4-12 and 9-7 records in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Seau signed with New England after his Dolphins years. Seau, who joined Miami after 13 seasons in San Diego was already a likely Hall of Famer when he moved to South Florida. But he never played to that status. “At the time he came to the Dolphins everybody knows he may have lost a step,” Gadsden said, “but he still had that passion.” And he endeared himself to everyone in the organization. Jason Taylor, the former Dolphins defensive end/linebacker, noted Seau’s attitude in his statement, which said, in part, “I'm shocked and saddened. Devastated, really. Junior was one of the most positive, uplifting people I have ever known.” Taylor noted how Seau was fond of calling everyone “buddy” and said “This is an immeasurable loss for so many. My heart and prayers go out to Junior's family, Gina and their children. I'm going to miss you buddy.” Dave Wannstedt, who was Miami’s head coach during Seau’s years with the Dolphins, is now Buffalo’s defensive coordinator. Wannstedt called Seau’s death “tragic” but, such as Gadsden, recalled Seau’s enthusiasm. “He brought a sense of renewed energy and a spirit to the field, off the field, in the weight room, just everywhere that Junior went and everyone that Junior was associated with,” Wannstedt’s statement said, in part. “He instilled a belief that we hadn’t reached our potential and that we could be better, and he would find a way to help make that happen.” Dolphins CEO Mike Dee acknowledged Seau’s charitable works and his personality in a statement on behalf of the organization. “Whether it was in San Diego, South Florida, New England or everywhere else in between, Junior loved putting a smile on a child’s face during his ‘Shop with a Jock’ program, or during one of his countless school visits. He made a difference to so many people in so many places,” the statement said. But it seemed no one took the death as hard as Thomas, who ended his statement by saying, “I am absolutely devastated to hear this news. Today I lost my hero, my friend, my buddy.""",Raw Data
226,"Jason Whitlock writes about the sports world from every angle, including those other writers can't imagine or muster courage to address. His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. More than the health of his knee, more than Mike Shanahan’s alleged negligence, here’s what concerned me about Robert Griffin’s first playoff appearance: RG3 bought the hype -- his own. His postgame comments explaining why he stayed in the game beyond the first quarter revealed a young man who had crossed the thin line between confidence and arrogance. “I don’t feel like me being out there hurt the team in any way,” Griffin proclaimed. “I’m the best option for this team, and that’s why I’m the starter.” That’s true when Griffin is healthy. He was clearly not healthy on Sunday, especially after he tweaked his already-injured knee late in the first quarter. On a gimpy leg, Griffin tossed a second touchdown pass and staked the Redskins to a 14-0 lead over the Seattle Seahawks. From that moment on, he was awful and a liability to his team. He couldn’t plant on his right leg or accurately throw the football downfield. He couldn’t run much either. He limped sideways for nine yards on one play, and you wondered why he stayed in the game. You can’t be Willis Reed in the 1970 NBA Finals and play quarterback in the NFL. Inspiration only goes so far at the QB position. Obviously, Mike Shanahan should’ve pulled his 22-year-old quarterback from the game. My initial thoughts during the game and in the immediate aftermath of Griffin re-injuring his knee in the fourth quarter were that Shanahan should be disciplined by Redskins owner Daniel Snyder for jeopardizing Griffin’s future. My feelings reflected the emotions of my Twitter following. Football fans from across the country berated Shanahan for his perceived negligence, particularly since USA Today reported that earlier in the season Washington’s team doctor -- James Andrews -- said he did not clear Griffin to re-enter the Ravens contest. On Monday morning, syndicated morning radio host Tom Joyner analogized Shanahan to the slave owner, Calvin Candie, in the popular movie Django Unchained. Candie trained and fought “Mandingo” fighters. He brutalized them. I get the point Joyner was trying to make. But he does not understand the politics of football in this era. Griffin has more power than Shanahan. It wasn’t until I heard Griffin’s postgame comments that I realized Griffin used that power to play in Sunday’s game. Griffin made it clear in his postgame news conference that he desperately wanted to play in Sunday’s contest and that he repeatedly made it clear to Shanahan that he wanted to stay in the game. Sitting Griffin isn’t as easy as it sounds, especially when the Redskins held the lead until midway through the fourth quarter. In fact, it wasn’t until the Seahawks took a 21-14 lead that Griffin’s knee completely gave out when he tried to scoop up a bad snap from his center. Until that moment, Griffin likely had visions of a Gatorade commercial dancing in his head. He likely thought he was in the middle of his Michael Jordan flu game. He could see Bill Simmons preparing a 30-for-30 documentary about the day he beat the Seattle Seahawks on one leg. Griffin stated that had the coaching staff tried to sit him, he would’ve run back onto the field. So with his team leading for the overwhelming majority of the game and his star QB defiant, what was Shanahan to do? I’m not excusing Shanahan. But I’m saying there was considerable risk in benching RG3. Shanahan could’ve fractured his relationship with his rookie quarterback. Had RG3 complained in the aftermath, some of the very same people crucifying Shanahan for leaving him in the game would be crucifying Shanahan for taking him out. Shanahan, who is white, is in a difficult spot. The Redskins represent one of the blackest and the most politically charged cities in America. Griffin, who is black, is a phenom. Black people and black sports fans are itching to discuss his race and itching to complain about racial unfairness as it relates to Griffin. Rob Parker’s misguided statements about Griffin being a “cornball brother” don’t begin to do justice to all the different ways Griffin is being discussed. Shanahan submitted to the will of his star QB and was analogized to the fictional slave owner of Candyland. The QB that everyone wanted Shanahan to send onto the field -- Kirk Cousins -- is the same QB some criticized Shanahan for drafting last year when he had already selected Griffin in the first round. Shanahan could see what we could see. Griffin was hurting his team trying to be a hero. But Shanahan is in a political quagmire. Any decision he makes with Griffin can be second-guessed and spun into a Django analogy. Moving forward, Shanahan will need the help of his young quarterback to navigate these dangerous waters. That’s going to require some humility and self-awareness from Griffin.",Raw Data

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. Quinton “Rampage” Jackson gave more of a show as he exited United Center than he did in his UFC on FOX 6 co-main event that Glover Teixeira dominated for a unanimous decision victory at United Center on Saturday night. ""He just walked out and screamed, 'You're gonna miss me!'"" UFC president Dana White relayed. “I said, ‘I miss you already, buddy.’” Maybe Rampage the name. Rampage the movie star. Rampage from five years ago. The Rampage in the Octagon was nothing to feel misty about. He was winded by the second round and maybe his lone victory on the night was not getting knocked out by Teixeira, who extended his winning streak to 18 consecutive fights. Jackson, 34, spent the final few seconds of the final fight of his UFC contract on his back as Teixeira fired away from the mount. While losing of late wasn't new for Jackson, there was a rare scene in a Fuel TV post-fight interview: a contrite and introspective Jackson. Need the punch-by-punch details from UFC on FOX? We've got 'em right here. “I’ve been fighting 13 years and the game has changed,” said Jackson, who didn’t appear at the post-fight news conference. “I don’t know if I can compete with the top people anymore. This is the first time I’ve lost three fights in a row. I have a lot of thinking to do. I am not going to give up. I feel like I can come back if I put my mind to it.” Jackson, a former light heavyweight champ, certainly hasn’t adapted, preferring to trade punches rather than go back to his wrestling roots to become a more complete fighter like champ Jon Jones. Teixeira, the target of Jackson’s taunts in recent days, actually gave Jackson the fight he wanted as he stood and traded all three rounds. “I tried to knock him out,” Teixeira said. “I said, ‘I’m going to stand with you and I’m going to try to knock you out.’ I knew knocking Rampage out is a tough thing to do. I did my best. I just stood and said, ‘Let’s see what’s going to happen.’” Teixeira got a few good shots in on Jackson, who showed — at the very least — he can take a punch. Jon Jones. Chael Sonnen. What more could you want? New episodes Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on FX. “If Glover was fighting anybody else, he would have knocked him out in the first round,” White said. Maybe that’s what we’re left with when we’re looking to praise Jackson. It certainly hasn’t been his attitude, not that Jackson’s brashness is anything new. (Especially for White, the focus of many of Jackson’s barbs.) Jackson certainly didn’t ingratiate himself to the media this week as he was combative at a news conference, at least when he wasn’t playing video games. He’s even gone after his own fans at times, although — judging by the applause here during the few fleeting moments he tagged Teixeira — he remains a popular figure in the sport. And the cast member of the “A-Team” movie looks to parlay the popularity at another MMA promotion. He said Saturday that maybe the twilight of his career would follow that of Gary “Big Daddy” Goodridge, a showman who was a huge draw even late into his kickboxing and MMA career. Take a look at the most brutal shots from UFC on FOX in Chicago. “He’s one of the guys who can put on a great show,” Jackson said. “He taught me it’s all about the show.” Goodridge is also a sad tale of somebody who hung on too long. He was diagnosed last year with the degenerative brain disease pugilistic dementia. For legends like Jackson, moving onto another league or, in this case, possibly another sport (boxing) is easier than choosing what’s prudent. Like retirement.",Raw Data

ESPN2 will provide coverage and analysis of the first round beginning at 8 p.m. ET from ESPN in Bristol, Conn. ESPNU will air the second and third rounds beginning at 9 p.m. ET. To schedule the WNBA Draft in prime time is a significant commitment by our broadcast partner, ESPN, and is indicative of the growing interest in the league and the womens game overall, said WNBA President, Laurel J. Richie. We are very much looking forward to the 2013 season and that tips off with what we anticipate will be one of the most exciting  and followed  drafts in league history. ESPN is continually looking for new ways to expand on our commitment to the WNBA and the sport of womens basketball, said Carol Stiff, ESPN vice president, programming and acquisitions. With the caliber of players that is expected to enter the 2013 WNBA Draft, it was a logical decision to move the event to a primetime window. After garnering the top selection in this years WNBA Draft Lottery, which aired on ESPNs SportsCenter, the Phoenix Mercury hold the top pick in the WNBA Draft for the third time in franchise history. In 2004 the Mercury used the No. 1 pick to select Diana Taurasi from the University of Connecticut and in the 2007 Draft they chose Dukes Lindsey Harding. Taurasi went on to lead Phoenix to a pair of championships and earn league MVP honors in 2009, while Harding eventually helped the Atlanta Dream win consecutive Eastern Conference titles. Last year, the Los Angeles Sparks used the top pick on Stanfords Nneka Ogwumike, who earned the WNBA Rookie of the Year award and helped lead the Sparks to the Western Conference Finals.

229,"Mario Gomez put Bayern ahead in the 22nd minute, before last season's runner-up lost defender Jerome Boateng to a straight red card in the 51st. But Thomas Mueller and Xherdan Shaqiri added goals for Bayern before BATE was also reduced to 10 men with a second booking for Denis Polyakov in the 69th. David Alaba scored for Bayern in the 83rd, while Yegor Filipenko netted a consolation goal for the Belarus side in the 89th. ''We had problems at the start because they defended well, but we wanted to give our fans something before Christmas,'' Gomez said. Bayern finished ahead of Valencia because of a better head-to-head record. Valencia won 1-0 in Lille to finish with Bayern on 13 points. BATE, which had already qualified for Europa League, finished third on six points. Lille was last with three. Although Bayern was eager to avenge a 3-1 loss in Belarus - one of its only two defeats this season - coach Jupp Heynckes left seven regulars on the bench. ''I am very pleased because this line-up had never played together before,'' Heynckes said. ''I have confidence in all my players.'' Gomez, in his first Champions League start after coming back from ankle surgery, notched his 21st goal in the competition thanks to a good run by the diminutive Shaqiri on the left. Shaqiri sent in a useful low cross, and Gomez stretched out his foot to knock the ball into the net. Boateng was sent off for a needless sliding tackle from behind on Artem Kontsevoi in BATE's half in the 51st. But only three minutes later, Mueller doubled the lead after a quickly taken free kick by Toni Kroos. Bastian Schweinsteiger flicked the ball to Mueller, who tapped it in from close range. Shaqiri, the shortest man on the pitch, somehow managed to sneak ahead of the towering Maksim Bordachev to head in a cross from Gomez to make it 3-0 in the 66th. Three minutes later, Polyakov earned his second booking for diving in Bayern's penalty area. Two late substitutes produced Bayern's fourth goal. Franck Ribery's corner wasn't cleared, allowing David Alaba to control the ball and then use the same left foot to drill it inside the post.

230,"Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com. He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. Yes, the Steroid Era is a large, pimply, ornery reason why, and everyone seems to have an opinion on what the Baseball Writers’ Association of America ought to do about it. Some want to bar the doors of Cooperstown. Some are comfortable enshrining even the most blatant performance-enhancing drug users without preconditions. And some expect the BBWAA to come up with an authoritative whodunit list of steroid cheats, even though such information is known only to scribes in the celestial press box. In this unenviable position, the BBWAA needs help. The most logical — and most necessary — step is to remove the prohibition on voting for more than 10 players, beginning with the 2013-2014 voting cycle. My most difficult snubs (Non-Steroid Division) Jack Morris: I do not dismiss that Morris was the winningest pitcher of the 1980s, but I can’t get past his 3.90 ERA, which would be the highest of any pitcher in the Hall. His supporters say he “pitched to the score,” but sorry, that doesn’t fully explain why his career ERA-plus barely rates above league average. Dale Murphy: Another case in which I fear electing a player who would lower the Hall’s standards. Virtually all of Murphy’s career offensive numbers are light, and his peak was too short. I give him points for his exemplary character, but even in his 15th and final year on the ballot, I can’t bring myself to give him my vote. The BBWAA never will have all the answers when it comes to PED use among Hall candidates. For all we know, a past steroid cheat has been enshrined already or will receive his ticket to Cooperstown when the 2013 results are announced Wednesday. But at a time when BBWAA members are expected to serve concurrently as talent evaluators, private investigators and morality policemen, they should be afforded two luxuries — time and flexibility. Here’s what that means: Hall of Fame electors — BBWAA members with at least 10 years of consecutive service — are instructed to vote for between zero and 10 players on each ballot. A candidate needs support from 75 percent of the voters to be elected. (Disclosure: I’m a BBWAA member but don’t have enough tenure to vote for the Hall.) The 10-player provision has been in place since the first election in 1936, when the majors included only 16 teams. This was more than a decade before Jackie Robinson courageously broke baseball’s color barrier, greatly expanding and diversifying the sport’s talent pool. Today, the majors include roughly twice as many teams — and nearly 30 percent of players on Opening Day rosters last year were born outside the United States. The game has more great talents from more places around the globe. Yet the limit on every Hall ballot has remained the same. Rather than grow incrementally in a way that maintains the same exclusivity, the 10-player cap makes it harder for contemporary players to gain entry. That, in fact, has nothing to do with steroid use. It’s a simple matter of scale. From skinny rookie to baseball's home run king to convicted felon. See the slugger's life in pictures. PEDs enter into play when we consider the evolution of voters’ thinking. Of course, the actual criteria, set forth by the Hall of Fame, remain unchanged: “Voting shall be based upon the player’s record, playing ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played.” The BBWAA isn’t easily convinced, enshrining more than two players in a year only once during the past two decades. But now it seems successful candidates must check three boxes. • Outstanding statistics, particularly in the realm of relative player value (WAR, OPS+, ERA+), to please the growing number of statistically minded voters. • A compelling narrative — ""The best such-and-such of his era"" — and sufficient old-timey measures of career achievement (MVPs, All-Star appearances, round numbers of hits or wins). • No firm evidence of steroid use. How difficult is it to pull off the hat trick? We’re about to find out. As my colleague Ken Rosenthal wrote earlier this week, there’s a chance no one will be voted in Wednesday. And if that happens, it may be because Jack Morris or Craig Biggio or Jeff Bagwell — worthy candidates, albeit for different reasons — were the mythical No. 11 on a number of ballots. Ken Rosenthal says it's actually a good thing that nobody was voted into the HOF this year. The electoral vise tightened with the debuts of Biggio, Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, Mike Piazza and Curt Schilling in the current cycle. The 10-man limit will be even more cumbersome next year, with the arrivals of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Frank Thomas, Mike Mussina and Jeff Kent. Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez, John Smoltz and Gary Sheffield follow the year after that. ESPN’s insightful Jim Caple deserves credit for identifying this crunch years ago and calling for the elimination of the 10-man maximum. Regardless of Wednesday’s result, officials from the Hall of Fame and BBWAA should discuss and ratify that very rule change. (The Hall’s Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of the selection process.) And if the ballot instructions remain untouched? Well, we can expect unjustifiably stagnant vote totals for many returning candidates. That much will be evident from Wednesday’s results. Morris (66.7 percent), Bagwell (56.0), Lee Smith (50.6), Tim Raines (48.7), Alan Trammell (36.8), and Edgar Martinez (36.5) were supported by at least a third of last year’s electorate, but how can they move upward during a year in which first-timers may occupy half the spots on many ballots? Today's game was shaped by the greats of days gone by. Learn about the oldest living Hall of Famers. Morris, in particular, could become the Sisyphus of Cooperstown. His vote total has climbed achingly close to the 75-percent summit. This year, some observers believe it could actually slide backward. And if Morris doesn’t make it Wednesday, he will be down to his 15th and final try next year — when he may not have much of a chance unless the rules are changed. An expanded ballot wouldn’t ensure Morris’ election. But it would give him — and all players — a fair chance to let their careers be judged on their own merits, rather than against an arbitrary limit set nearly 80 years ago. The greater flexibility also would allow the BBWAA to keep credible candidates on the ballot — which requires a minimum 5 percent — while we gain more (but not complete) perspective on the Steroid Era. The job of Hall of Fame voters is hard enough. With a little more room to work, they have a better chance to get it right.",Raw Data

Reece Wabara powerfully headed in a third for the League One club and, even though Joe Allen reduced Liverpool's arrears with a deflected volley, Oldham clung on to seal a famous win. Smith gave indication of his threat in just the third minute with the sort of goal you associate with a player of his physical stature. Youssouf M'Changama swung over a cross from the left and the 23-year-old used every inch of his 6ft 6in frame to out-muscle Sebastian Coates and head past Jones. The first half had an edge to it as Raheem Sterling was booked for challenge on M'Changama which ultimately forced the Oldham midfielder off after just 10 minutes. Robbie Simpson, a scorer at Anfield in Oldham's 5-1 third-round defeat last season, was also cautioned for going in on Jones after the goalkeeper had failed to hold the ball - which turned out to be a pre-cursor of what was to come. Suarez, captaining on the day, brought Liverpool level in the 17th minute when he set off on a driving run from deep and looked to pass but got a lucky rebound off defender Cliff Byrne and reacted quickly to hammer the ball inside Dean Bouzanis' left-hand post. The Uruguayan's touch to Jordan Henderson's inswinging free-kick then diverted the ball into the net only to be denied by an offside flag, while Sterling should have scored after Suarez's pass was backheeled into his path by Fabio Borini but he shot straight at the keeper. But Oldham remained unbowed as they took great heart from the physical battles they were winning and were rewarded with a second goal moments before the interval. Smith, who had already had a header tipped over by Jones in added time, converted the simplest of chances after a howler by the Liverpool goalkeeper who fumbled Wabara's cross to allow Lee Croft to square a pass for the striker to poke home. Borini had the chance to equalise from Jack Robinson's cross with the second half less than a minute old but he side-footed over and it proved costly. The visitors' defensive fallibility in the air was exposed again on 48 minutes as Carl Winchester swung a cross to the far post and Wabara rose above Robinson to head over Jones into the far corner. Steven Gerrard's introduction from the bench was not long in coming and the England captain soon had a shot blocked from which Daniel Sturridge blazed over.

236,"February didn’t get off to the start the Pistons wanted with the loss to Charlotte, but the stretch of games ahead still represents a golden opportunity for this team. We know there are great veterans on the Pistons, but we also know there are some young people who can learn from playing under some pressure. And that’s what this is – it’s pressure to get back into the playoff hunt. The loss to Charlotte probably was like a shot in the mouth to this team. The Bobcats are the No. 8 team in the East right now, so not only do the Pistons have to jump a couple of other teams, they have to pass Charlotte to make it into the playoffs. Maybe it was kind of a wakeup call. Obviously, the Bobcats were focused and the young Pistons and their veterans have to know what they’re up against here. If they can take advantage of their home-heavy February schedule, they’ll put pressure on the other guys. That’s what it’s all about. You feel pressure, sure, but you can turn up the heat on the other teams, too. It’s an intriguing mix of games coming up and a great chance for fans to see some really meaningful basketball games. Just in the days leading up to the All-Star break, the Pistons have six more home games at The Palace. Clearly, there are some winnable games on the schedule – no disrespect to New Jersey on Friday and some of the others – but there are also some difficult games coming up. San Antonio next Tuesday has the best record in the league and then Miami with all three of its superstars now healthy – LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, of course – comes to The Palace next Friday, followed by two more playoff teams, Portland and Atlanta. So there are teams you feel like you should have a shot to beat, whether they’re home against the Nets or on the road against Milwaukee and Cleveland, and teams you can measure up against among the NBA elite. All those games are part of a learning process for a professional athlete and a professional team. If you can learn how you measure up against the best in the league and you can learn what it’s like to play against the teams you’re fighting for a playoff spot, it makes everything bigger and more meaningful – every shot, every possessions, every defensive stand. You remember more about games that are ultra-meaningful and more about games that are against the best in the league. In both cases, I think it’s an opportunity to take giant steps forward for a young team. I know there’s a school of thought among some fans that it’s better to be in the lottery than to try to make the playoffs or get there and lose in the first round. But I don’t buy that. I never have. First of all, you owe it to the players, the coaches and the fans. There are eight spots in both the East and the West and, yes, I’ll agree six of them are probably sewn up in the East. That means five or six teams are fighting for those last two spots and if you have a chance, you need to go for it. No getting around it. The fans that have come out and supported this team as it restructures itself deserve to have this squad make a meaningful push toward a playoff spot. It would be a great reward for everybody, frankly, including all the people who work so tirelessly in the front office and on the business side at The Palace who make the games themselves there so interesting with fireworks and music and everything else. It helps to have meaningful games and games the Pistons win so they can perhaps be a team that plays in the postseason. For the young players so important to the Pistons’ future, there’s a lot of value to making a playoff push and perhaps playing in a playoff series. That includes Greg Monroe, having such a great year and chosen to play in the Rookie-Soph Challenge. And I’ll just say this: Jonas Jerebko was so good last year and now he’s had most of his second year taken away from him. I’m sure Jonas is on the sidelines chomping at the bit. He can’t wait to get back out there. This season would have been a lot different had Jonas Jerebko been a part of it. I’m sure he’s thinking if the Pistons can stay in the hunt until he gets back, it will be all the more meaningful for him. He deserves to play in games that matter. For Jonas and all the rest of the Pistons, they need to stay in the hunt as long as they can and give themselves the best shot at making the playoffs.",Raw Data

It started when MLS intended to trademark the term ''Cascadia Cup'' in the United States and Canada - prompting outrage from the fans who named the yearly head-to-head competition between the Sounders, Whitecaps and Timbers, and gave it a stately silver trophy. MLS claims it wants to protect the Cascadia Cup from outsiders looking to exploit it. The supporters fear that MLS itself will be exploiting the expression.",Raw Data
238,"The doctor who performed the knee surgery on Robert Griffin III says it is ''everybody's hope and belief'' that the Washington Redskins quarterback will be ready for the 2013 season. Orthopedist James Andrews said Wednesday that Griffin ''had a direct repair'' of the lateral collateral ligament and ''a re-do of his previous ACL reconstruction.'' Andrews says he expects a full recovery because of Griffin's ''high motivation.'' Griffin reinjured his knee in Sunday's playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He previously tore the ACL in the same knee while playing for Baylor in 2009. Griffin had surgery to repair two ligaments in his troublesome right knee Wednesday morning. Now comes RG3's next challenge: a race against time to get healthy before the beginning of next season. Injuries are a part of football, but these players have been hit particularly hard. Griffin's recovery time will take several months at least but could extend into next season, depending on the extent of the damage. The process could also be sped up because Griffin is known as a focused, determined competitor who would be expected to take his rehab as seriously as possible. ''Thank you for your prayers and support. I love God, my family, my team, the fans, & I love this game. See you guys next season,'' Griffin tweeted before the surgery began. Athletes generally need nine to 12 months to make a full recovery from a torn ACL, although Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson made a remarkable return this season about eight months after tearing an ACL — and nearly broke the NFL's single-season rushing record. Russ Paine, a physical therapist in Houston who worked with Peterson during his rehab, said the running back's timetable for returning to competition was in fact ''pretty traditional.'' ''What's non-traditional is him almost breaking the rushing record,'' Paine said in a phone interview Wednesday. Griffin reinjured his knee at least twice in Sunday's playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks, prompting a national debate over whether coach Mike Shanahan endangered Griffin's career by not taking the team's franchise player out of the game sooner. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. The first major injury to the knee came in 2009, when Griffin tore the ACL in the third game of the season while playing for Baylor. Griffin missed the rest of the year but returned in 2010 and won the Heisman Trophy in 2011. Griffin sprained the LCL last month when he was hit by Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata at the end of a 13-yard scramble. Griffin missed one game and returned to play three more while wearing a bulky knee brace, his mobility clearly hindered. Then, on Sunday, Griffin hurt the knee again as he fell awkwardly while throwing a pass in the first quarter against the Seahawks. He remained in the game, with Shanahan saying he trusted Griffin's word that all was OK. Griffin finally departed in the fourth quarter, after the knee buckled while he was trying to field a bad shotgun snap. The No. 2 overall pick in last year's draft, Griffin was one of several rookie quarterbacks to make an instant impact on the NFL this season. He set the league record for best season passer rating by a rookie QB and led the Redskins to their first NFC East title in 13 years. But he also had to leave three games early due to injuries — two because of his knee and one because of a concussion — and missed a fourth altogether because of the knee.",Raw Data
239,"DENVER (AP) -- Brittney Griner made it clear, way in advance: No matter what happened Tuesday in the NCAA championship game against Notre Dame, she's returning to Baylor for her senior season. While most male college basketball stars of Griner's caliber would have left for the NBA after their freshman year, the 6-foot-8 phenom will stay in school to earn her general studies degree in recreation. ""I'm staying, I made a commitment,"" Griner said. ""I'm going to stay here until my time's up, so all the speculations of me leaving early are false."" After hearing her star player say those words at the press conference Saturday, coach Kim Mulkey asked her to repeat it again, ""a little louder so everyone could hear."" Really, it's not a huge shock that Griner will be headed back to Baylor. Staying in school is the norm for marquee women's college players. Diana Taurasi and Maya Moore played all four years. Candace Parker left Tennessee with a year of eligibility remaining, but she already had graduated when she was the top pick in the WNBA draft in 2008. One big reason: The money offered to female players, whether in the United States or even abroad, just isn't on the same scale as what men can earn. While women players would certainly appreciate better pay in the pro ranks, they are more likely to graduate. An annual report released in March by the University of Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport found players from the women's teams in the NCAA tournament graduated at an overall rate of 89 percent, compared with 67 percent for the men. Having players stick around also helps grow the women's game, since fans actually get to see them blossom from freshmen to seniors. Only a few players have ever ventured out early, with former Rutgers star Epiphanny Prince being the biggest star to do so, in 2009. And in fact, it's not as easy for female players to leave early as it is for men, even if they want to. The WNBA has a much stricter code of eligibility for players than the NBA. To play in the WNBA, a player must turn 22 during the year they are drafted, graduate from college or see their class finish its coursework during the three-month period following the draft. Or the player must be out of high school for four years. ""I think it's a great rule,"" Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. ""I think getting your education is the reason you go to college. I think that you want to come out with that degree so after your career ends at the old age of 30 or so you're ready to go into the world and do something else. I think the money is so small that there isn't the attraction that the men have to leave college and make that kind of money."" While the top pick in the NBA could earn roughly $5 million dollars, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA makes about $48,000. The real financial windfall comes overseas for those players who choose to play in Russia or Turkey. Griner could potentially earn over $1 million. ""Everybody tells me I can make millions, but money isn't everything,"" Griner said. ""Money doesn't buy happiness. And I made a commitment. When I make a commitment, I keep my word. And these are your best years, in college. I'm just trying to have my full experience. It was never tempting. I never really even had to think or debate about it."" Griner isn't the only marquee star playing Tuesday night who could play in the WNBA this summer. Notre Dame guard Skylar Diggins is also eligible to enter the WNBA draft on April 16. Yet she also emphatically dismissed the idea, making it very clear she plans to stick around and get her degree in business. ""I'm committed to this program,"" she said. ""I'm going to use all of my eligibility. I'm going to stay a kid as long as I can. I'm not ready for bills and things like that. I'm going to stay out of that. I've preached this before and I'm going to stick to it - getting my education is the most important thing. That's a big reason why I chose Notre Dame, the education and what comes with that degree. It's important. A lot of people take notice."" While Diggins can't play above the rim like Griner, she has already mastered the art of marketing herself. The junior guard has become one of the most followed female athletes on Twitter with over 191,000 followers. She has said after graduating from Notre Dame she hopes to be a television analyst as well as a basketball player. ""We understand that we don't make millions our first year out like the guys are capable of, and at the same time, I think it's a loyalty to the program, the fans, the community, coach McGraw. I'm excited for next year at Notre Dame. I'm working on finishing this year, but I'm exciting about coming back and finishing school. I only have 20 credits left. Knocking that out and being able to graduate in January would be perfect.""",Raw Data

241,"How about a block party for the two-time All-American from Baylor who already holds the NCAA women's record with 11 dunks and is a three-point play from becoming the Big 12's career scoring leader. Griner set the NCAA career record for blocked shots, getting the record-tying and record-setting blocks by swatting away a pair of shots by Oklahoma's Aaryn Ellenberg, as the top-ranked Lady Bears won 82-65 Saturday for their 50th consecutive win at home. ''Definitely happy I got that. Now I'm going to try to set it higher,'' the 6-foot-8 Griner said. ''Blocked shots keep the other team from scoring, that's just how I look at it. Blocked shots kind of remind me when I played volleyball, I used to love to spike. ... That's why I like (blocks) the most.'' With eight in the game, Griner has 665 career blocks, two more than Louella Tomlinson had for St. Mary's in California (2007-11). ''As good as she is on the offensive end, where she really changes games is on the defensive end,'' Oklahoma coach Sherri Coale said. ''She obviously has the wingspan and the athleticism, but she also has that ornate sense that I think all great shot blockers have knowing when to go get it.'' By fouling out for only the second time in her 131 career games, Griner missed a chance to also break the Big 12 scoring record before the Lady Bears (18-1, 8-0 Big 12) play their next two games on the road. Her 2,833 career points are two shy of matching Oklahoma State's Andrea Riley's (2007-10). Griner finished with 15 points to lead six players in double figures for Baylor, which has won 36 consecutive Big 12 regular-season and tournament games since a loss to Oklahoma in the conference tournament three years ago. Odyssey Sims had 12 points and 10 assists while Destiny Williams had 11 points and 10 rebounds. Ellenberg had 33 points for the Sooners (15-4, 5-2). Joanna McFarland had 12 points and 16 rebounds. Griner got her 663rd career block with just under 13 minutes left. A similar play with 10:25 remaining was Griner's seventh of the game and broke Tomlinson's record. With 5:14 to go, Griner was called for a foul on another shot by Ellenberg. It was the first time she fouled out since the second game of her freshman season. ''Disappointed I fouled out at the end of the game,'' Griner said. That came less than a minute after Griner was called for a charge against McFarland for the second time in the game. In a 30-second span of the first half, McFarland drew charges against Griner and Jordan Madden and hit a 3-pointer in between. ''It's not like a fear. You've just got to go in and bow up, like if she goes hard at me, I've got to go hard back,'' McFarland said. ''It's a mutual thing.'' McFarland's long-range shot pulled the Sooners within 26-21, but they never got closer. The Sooners made 11 of 26 3-pointers, but were just 9 of 46 inside the arc. ''I'm really proud of our guys, I thought we competed and fought every step of the way, and did some really, really good things and attacked them, and went after them, and shot pretty well from 3,'' Coale said. ''Obviously did not shoot well from 2, but there's a big reason for that. Her number's 42 (Griner).'' Oklahoma won the opening tip and Ellenberg immediately hit a 3-pointer. The Sooners were up 10-8 when Ellenberg hit another 3 from the top left of the key 4 minutes later. Baylor then scored 14 points in a row over the next 5 minutes and took the lead for good. The spurt ended with consecutive baskets by Brooklyn Pope, who finished with 10 points like Kimetria Hayden and Jordan Madden. Even after shooting 60 percent from the field (35 of 58) and having six players in double figures against the Big 12's second-place team, there were still things for Baylor coach Kim Mulkey to emphasize to her team. ''You have to evaluate yourself and say if you shot like that and had that many players in double figures, why did you only win by 17?,'' Mulkey said. ''Well then it goes back to two things. One, missed free throws, they make free throws. We missed 14 free throws, that's unacceptable. Then they made a lot of 3's.'' Not nearly enough though.",Raw Data
242,"Eurosport - Williams Formula One drivers Pastor Maldonado (L) and Valtteri Bottas and test-driver Susie Wolff (R) pose with the new FW35 racing car during its presentation at Circuit de Catalunya racetrack … more in Montmelo, near Barcelona (Reuters) less Related Content Eurosport - Tue, Feb 19, 2013 17:04 GMT Related Content Bet on Formula 1 The last of the 11 teams to show off their 2013 car, the former champions had barely started testing the FW35 before it emerged that the sport's governing body disagreed with their interpretation of the rules. ""The team spoke with the FIA this morning which is when they gave us their view,"" said a spokeswoman at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya. ""The team are now seeking further clarification on this and a decision as to whether this design will be carried forward will be made before the first race."" The season starts in Australia on March 17, with one more four-day test scheduled for Barcelona after the current one ends on Friday. Teams can put all sorts of aerodynamic and technical innovations on their cars in testing with the FIA only declaring them to be 'illegal' once they are presented for grand prix scrutineering. All teams are constantly seeking advice from the governing body, however, as they search for possible loopholes or seek to deny rivals any suspected advantage. Caterham have already drawn critical comments from rivals for their exhaust design, with Lotus technical director James Allison saying at the previous test that he expected to see changes before Melbourne. The FIA concern is believed to be over the use of bodywork behind the exhaust exits that harnesses the gases for aerodynamic advantage. The technical debate followed a confident rollout by Williams, who won with Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado at the Barcelona track last year. ""Given the rule stability over the winter, I'm pleased with the gains that we've been able to make with this car,"" said technical director Mike Coughlan. ""It's a better, more refined Formula One car than the FW34."" Founder Frank Williams, whose team are the second most successful in terms of constructors' championships (nine) but finished eighth last year, saw a step forward. ""Williams has been at the top many times over the last 30 years. It's the nature of the sport to have ups and downs, but when we are down we always fight our way back,"" he said. ""I'm hoping that with the current team we have in place... we will be in a position to challenge the very best."" Maldonado has a new team mate this year in Finnish rookie Valtteri Bottas, previously the reserve. Susie Wolff, wife of shareholder and new Mercedes team executive director Toto, is the development driver and was first to drive the new car in a shakedown at the nearby Idiada track before Maldonado took over for the second pre-season test. The team said more than 80 percent of the car was new, including the gearbox and rear suspension as well as radiators, floor, the exhausts, bodywork and nose. A ""considerable"" amount of weight had been saved also. Reliability work over the winter had been promising, with the gearbox alone completing 3,200km on the dyno at the factory. ""This season we must be even more competitive which I believe is possible,"" said Maldonado, who got married over the winter break and also has a new race engineer. ""My goal is to help take the team back to the top.""",Raw Data

Sports stars make loads of cash but they don't always hang on to it. Check out athletes who went bankrupt. Are you too young to recall “Scared Straight”? A handful of juvenile troublemakers visited Rahway State Prison. They were placed in a room filled with hardened inmates who cussed, screamed, threatened and described the horrors of incarceration in graphic, four-letter-word detail. The three-hour conversation was reduced to a 52-minute documentary. I remember watching the show late at night with my brother, stepsister and stepbrother. We were between the ages of 10 and 17. We were scared. We talked about the show for days with all of our friends. Obviously this was long before the social-media era, long before cell phones were common. But somehow everyone — and I mean everyone — watched “Scared Straight.” It won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1978. It was hailed as revolutionary TV. Most people, in the moment, thought it was an effective tool in convincing troubled youth into making better choices. I’ve never forgotten “Scared Straight.” Many of you will never forget “Broke.” It was Corben’s simple attempt at scaring athletes into making better financial decisions. For years we’ve read the stories about young professional athletes squandering millions of dollars and filing for bankruptcy shortly after their careers end. Corben put all the stories in one place and let the athletes speak their own stories in front of a camera and a microphone. The presentation was uncreative but powerful. If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: Sports fans, athletes and executives connected to the sports world responded to the show organically on Twitter. It was a big town hall meeting about an obvious topic. It was the new millennium's “Scared Straight.” What will be the result? I’m reluctant to call “Scared Straight” a failure. The forces — drug war and politically driven, get-tough sentencing guidelines — that have powered America’s astronomical, world-leading, shameful incarceration rate undermined any chance of “Scared Straight” having any legitimate cultural impact. But “Scared Straight” did work. It got our attention. It caused young people to focus on the consequences of their rebellious misbehavior. What “Scared Straight” did not do is provoke our society to double-back down on providing opportunities to troubled youths. Opportunity is a better long-term motivator than fear. Education is a better healer of dysfunction than fear. The difficult job of teaching a man to fish cures starvation more effectively than explaining the perils of starvation. We need to teach athletes to fish, and we need to teach them in a language and a curriculum they are passionate about. Too many people think education is memorization. True education is about learning the ability to think critically. Knowing the exact dates of the start and end of the Civil War will serve you well on ""Jeopardy."" But it will not teach you how to think critically, how to deduce. Many so-called educated people simply cannot think. They can’t apply all the bits of information they’ve memorized to life skills. You can learn damn near everything you need to know about life through the study of sports. It’s all there. By understanding the history of Major League Baseball or the NFL, you can learn the concepts of America’s system of governance (democracy) and system of economics (capitalism). Much of my column philosophy is based on the premise that I can use the sports world to explain the rest of the world. Last week I wrote a column comparing the NFL’s replacement referee disaster to the 2008 financial collapse. There is no better place to learn about diverse human interaction than the sports world. Major League Baseball is the United Nations. You might think a finance class would solve most athletes’ financial woes. Nope. They have to first develop the critical-thinking ability to understand the value in a finance class. As a society we can do a much better job of making education inviting to athletes by teaching them in areas of their passions. The History of the NBA sounds like a course for dummies. It doesn’t have to be if taught properly. I know many of you are laughing. You think I’m suggesting the pampering of athletes. I’m not. Whatever level of intellect I have — and I admit it may not be much — was cultivated by my intense passion for sports and wanting to understand the sports world. No teacher asked me to read Sports Illustrated as a kid. I studied the sports world on my own time, and I put more time into that than my regular school work. I regret that now. And I’ve spent a significant portion of my adult life studying things I could’ve learned in high school. But my advanced degree in sports has helped me easily understand the things I’m learning now. I’ve recently read several books on Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. General McClellan’s fear of engagement, unwillingness to exploit his superior numbers reminded me of a too-conservative football coach (Marty Schottenheimer). General Robert E. Lee made me think of Sean Payton, a fearless gambler. My degree in sports taught me to think critically, taught me to read people and situations. If athletes understood their industry on a much deeper level, they would not be as prone to make the financial and personal mistakes they routinely make. Colleges and universities across the country are making millions of dollars off the labor of these athletes. Those institutions of education also have an obligation to prepare these young people for life after school. Every athlete, including those of us who never got a whiff of a pro contract, could benefit from being taught the world through the prism of sports, our passion.",Raw Data
244,"1. Monday Fun-day: Woods has a good record in Monday finishes at Torrey Pines. It was on a Monday that he defeated Rocco Mediate in a memorable 19-hole playoff for the US Open title in 2008. Woods is hoping for not nearly as close a finish this time. “I’ve got to continue with executing my game plan,” he said. “That’s the idea. I’ve got 11 holes to play, and I’ve got to go out there and play them well.” In spite of erratic play to start the fourth round, Woods was 3 under for the seven holes he completed before darkness. He saved par at the first two holes after hitting drives well left of the fairway, then birdied the par-3 third after hitting his tee shot to 11 feet. He chipped in for a second consecutive birdie after missing the fairway well right on No. 4. Woods had to hole an 8-foot par putt at the fifth hole after hitting his approach into a greenside bunker. He two-putted for birdie at the sixth hole after reaching the green in two shots with a 5-wood from the right rough, then parred No. 7. He hit just two of six fairways in the fourth round, but scrambled well enough to grow his lead from four to six shots. 2. TV time: The final round will not resume until 11:10 a.m. PT Monday. No, the late start has nothing to do with the pesky fog that basically canceled Saturday’s play. This is all about television. Golf Channel and CBS will televise portions of Monday’s play. CBS, which will show the tournament’s conclusion, asked the PGA Tour to have the fourth round finish at 2:30 p.m. local time. “They're our television partner, and if that's what they want to do, that's what we're going to,” said Mark Russell, the PGA Tour’s senior vice president of rules and competitions. Russell couldn’t recall ever starting a Monday finish so late. There’s little question the desire to televise Monday’s finish was based on the man atop the leaderboard. The late finish keeps any player who made the cut at Torrey Pines from participating in the Monday qualifier for the Waste Management Phoenix Open. That qualifier featured many of the Q-School and Web.com Tour graduates since only about five or six players in that category will get into the Phoenix field. 3. Like old times: The third round began Sunday morning, and Woods had built a six-shot lead by the time he came to the 18th tee. He bogeyed the easy par-5 and Brad Fritsch, playing in the group ahead of him, made birdie to reduce Woods’ lead to four entering the final round. Woods is seeking his eighth title at Torrey Pines. His last victory here came in 2008. Woods’ play early Sunday was reminiscent of his form during those early years. He missed just two fairways on the front nine of his third round Sunday, often twirling his driver as another ball found the fairway. He hit 15 of 18 greens, as well. Four of Woods’ five birdies came on putts of 3 feet or less. The other was completed by a 6-foot putt. 4. In the rearview mirror: Woods’ closest competitors have had success here. Snedeker won last year after overcoming another large lead: He was seven shots behind Kyle Stanley at the start of the final round, and three shots back with one hole remaining. Nick Watney is the 2009 champion. The Monday finish forced Watney to cancel his plans to go surfing. Instead of catching waves he’ll be chasing arguably the game’s best front-runner. “All we can do tomorrow is go out and try to make him think about it a little bit and see what happens,” said Watney, who’s playing two groups ahead of Woods. Snedeker is back near the top of the leaderboard after a fantastic Sunday. He was tied for the 18-hole lead after shooting 65 on Torrey Pines North, but struggled with his putter Friday on the South Course and shot 75. Snedeker was 7 under for 31 holes Sunday to move up 29 spots on the leaderboard. He has just five holes remaining Monday. “I’ve got a long way to go,” Snedeker said. “I’ve got a guy at the top of the leaderboard who doesn’t like giving up leads, so I have to go catch him.” For some golfers, the biggest prizes aren't their tournament wins but their wives and girlfriends. 5. Short shots: Monday qualifier Adam Hadwin was in ninth place through 54 holes. He was 12 over through 15 holes when the fourth round was suspended, though, and had fallen into 83rd. . . . Phil Mickelson, even par for nine holes Monday, is T-72. . . . Erik Compton is T-5 with 11 holes remaining; he’s seeking his first top-10 in his 59th career Tour start. . . . Rookie Brad Fritsch is fourth, two shots out of second place; he’s trying to extend this streak: a 2012 Web.com Tour grad has finished first or second in each of the season’s first two full-field events.

245,"The news came during Boston's 100-98 double-overtime win over the Miami Heat on Sunday in which Ray Allen returned to his old home court for the first time. ''New guys are going to get an opportunity now,'' Boston forward Paul Pierce said. ''These guys haven't had a chance to really showcase what they can do.'' For the past five seasons, Pierce, Allen and Kevin Garnett made up the Big Three. After Allen signed with the Heat as a free agent in the offseason, Rondo joined that group - and became the team leader with his ability to run the offense. He was chosen as the starting point guard for the Eastern Conference in the All-Star game in Houston on Feb. 17. Now the Celtics hope he can be ready for the start of next season. See where we rank Rajon Rondo among NBA's top 10 point guards. ''How far is that?'' coach Doc Rivers said, ''I don't even know how long that is. Eight months? Nine months? So he'll probably be ready, but I don't know. Rondo injured his right knee in Friday night's 123-112 double-overtime loss in Atlanta, a game in which the Celtics blew a 27-point lead, but Rivers said he didn't know when. He reported to the TD Garden on Sunday for a pregame shootaround but was taken to a hospital after complaining of pain. The initial report was a hyperextended knee, but tests showed the ACL tear. Rivers said he learned about 25 minutes before the game that Rondo wouldn't play. Word of the injury's severity came during the game. ''He was telling me he thought he pulled his hamstring,'' Rivers said, ''Rondo will be fine. He just will not be fine this year.'' The team made the announcement during Sunday's win in the nationally televised game that snapped a losing streak that had reached six games despite back-to-back triple-doubles by Rondo. ''We've just got to rally around each other,'' Pierce said. ''I feel for him. He was having such a good season. It's disappointing news.'' As Celtics players walked off the court through a tunnel toward their locker room, Rondo, dressed in street clothes, greeted them. ''I know he's sad. I'm sad for him,'' starting guard Avery Bradley said. ''Whatever Doc wants me to play, that's what I'm going to do.'' Rondo was averaging career highs of 13.7 points and 5.6 rebounds along with 11.1 assists this season. Still, the Celtics are struggling to remain around .500, finishing the day with a 21-23 record, 2 1/2 games ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers for the eighth and final spot in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics have no true point guard behind Rondo. Rivers said he didn't know if they would try to add one. Jason Terry, known for his outside shooting, Courtney Lee, Leandro Barbosa and Bradley are the other guards. Each played at least 25 minutes Sunday with Lee starting in Rondo's place. ''We knew something was up at the beginning, but we didn't know how serious it was,'' Lee said. ''Nobody can fill his shoes. That's what makes him great. So the only thing we can do is work as hard as possible and keep the momentum going from this game and have no letup.'' Rondo suffered a dislocated left elbow in the playoffs on May 7, 2011, when he became entangled with Miami's Dwyane Wade. Boston won 97-81, but Miami won the next two games to clinch the second-round series in five games.",Raw Data
246,"Benitez arrived at Stamford Bridge in November determined to land some silverware during his spell as interim manager. But he has instead watched one piece after another slip from his grasp in the midst of a campaign in which Chelsea have competed on an unprecedented number of fronts. Two trophies could vanish in the space of five days if they follow up Wednesday's Capital One Cup exit with an FA Cup fourth-round shock at Brentford on Sunday. But despite no Chelsea manager having survived the axe at the end of a barren season since Roman Abramovich bought the club, Benitez claimed he should, and would, be judged by a different standard. He said: ""If you analyse all the managers, how many had pre-season here? Not me."" ""How many managers have spent massive money here? Not me."" ""How many managers have played in Japan in the middle of the season with some players injured and they had players in the African Cup of Nations? It is just only me."" ""My conclusion is the reality is that if you put everything together and you will see why we are happy in the way we are doing things and the way the team is progressing."" Asked if he would like to stay on beyond the summer, Benitez said: ""I like to be at a top side and Chelsea is a top side with great potential. So I think it's a great opportunity."" A permanent contract for the former Liverpool boss would go down like a lead balloon among the supporters who vehemently protested against his appointment. Benitez was undeterred. He said: ""If we play a game like we played against Arsenal [last week], this is what every fan, everyone is expecting, a winning team with a winning mentality, attractive football, scoring goals and strong in defence."" Benitez also reined back from his recent admission that Chelsea were completely out of the Barclays Premier League title race, having closed to within 11 points of Manchester United. ""If you play two or three games in a row and you can win in the Premier League, what will happen? You never know,"" he said, promising a stronger challenge next season if he remained in charge. Pointing out competing on an unprecedented eight fronts this season had stretched resources to the limit, he said: ""I think this team has enough quality and the squad is a good squad."" ""The circumstances this year were more difficult."" ""If this club - which is a top, top side - continue doing things in the right way, they will always be challenging for trophies."" Benitez admitted Chelsea were two players short at present, with John Obi Mikel and Victor Moses on Africa Cup of Nations duty. He insisted he was happy with his squad ahead of the closing of the transfer window but added: ""Obviously, every manager wants a little bit more."" Benitez is preparing to rest some of his weary stars at Griffin Park, something that could put the FA Cup holders at risk of a shock against lower-league opponents. The Spaniard knows all about those from his time at Liverpool, who suffered ignominious exits at the hands of Burnley, Barnsley and Reading during his six years in charge. ""We will try to win and avoid this situation but we know the cup is always dangerous and that anything can happen,"" he said. A likely first start since November for fit-again captain John Terry would help prevent that. ""He is a key player for us and for the rest of the season,"" Benitez said, becoming the latest Chelsea boss to hail Terry as management material. ""We agree on a lot of things in football."" ""We don't talk too much about tactics. But I have had players in the past who have been big names, who have not understood the game like him. He seems as though he understands."" ""The way he treats the young players and takes care of them, it is quite possible he has the qualities to become a manager.""",Raw Data
247,"Each FOXSports.com fantasy contributor shared three-to-five fantasy baseball sleepers to keep an eye on heading into owners' fantasy baseball drafts. Over the next two months, expect several updates to our positional fantasy baseball second base rankings. Howie Kendrick, Angels – Heading into last April, Albert Pujols’ arrival in Anaheim positioned Kendrick up the second basemen ranks, with the theory that the presence of the three-time MVP would correlate to amplified run production. This principle didn’t come to fruition, as the emergence of Mike Trout slid Kendrick from the two-hole to the bottom of the lineup. A stumble out of the gate didn’t help matters either, flashing a shabby .251/.280/.367 through his first 53 games. Yet the rest of the way home, Kendrick showcased the hitting tools that made him such a prominent selection, hitting .308 in the final 94 games of his campaign. Hoping for Kendrick to duplicate his feat of 18 long balls in 2010 is wishful thinking, but the Angels second baseman is a top-10 talent at his position that can be had in the later rounds of fantasy drafts. Daniel Murphy, Mets – Absolutely no power production here, but you’re getting a solid and steady, if not spectacular, player in Murphy. His .302 batting mark the past two seasons makes Murphy a viable shot in the arm for teams searching for help in the average column. His hike in strikeouts is somewhat troubling giving the lack of homers, though his career 22.6 line-drive percentage is too enticing to pass up. Though he’s more suited for a bench role than a starter, in daily leagues, Murphy is the type of glue guy whose consistent output can be the difference at the end of the season. Jeff Keppinger, White Sox – The journeyman infielder had a career year in Tampa and parlayed that success into a long-term deal on the South Side of Chicago. While that’s normally enough info to shy away from a soon-to-be 33-year-old, don’t envision the raking to diminish for Keppinger, who should flourish in the hitter-friendly confines of U.S. Cellular Field. Reaching double-digits in the four-bagger category probably won’t befall, yet a figure on the positive side of a .300 batting average with 60 runs and 60 RBI should be expected. Given this forecast is similar to second basemen ranked near the top 10, Keppinger, who will go unselected in many a draft, is a bargain. Chris Nelson, COL - Nelson, a former first-round pick, finally broke through in a big way for the Rockies in 2012. He logged 33 extra-base hits with 53 RBI and a strong .301 batting average last season. The looming concern about Nelson is his contact rate. He struck out 84 times in 345 at-bats last year (one per four at-bats). Still, while Colorado doesn’t have the same home field advantage of years past, Nelson certainly acclimated well to the home park. He batted .347 at home, a full 90 points higher than his road mark. As an added bonus, Nelson boasts both second base and third base eligibility for 2013. Scott Sizemore, OAK - Sizemore missed the 2012 season because of a torn ACL. As a result, he’ll slip off the radar, though he’s likely to claim either the starting second base or third base role in Oakland. In 2011, Sizemore produced fantastic numbers as a member of the A’s after coming over from the Tigers. He batted only .249, but yielded 33 extra-base hits (11 home runs) with 52 RBI in 93 games. Steve Lombardozzi, WAS - Lombardozzi isn’t going to be the everyday second baseman in Washington immediately, but there are lingering concerns about platoon-mate Danny Espinosa’s inability to hit left-handers. Lombardozzi batted .273 in 126 games last season, producing 22 extra-base hits with 27 RBI and five stolen bases. The 24-year-old switch-hitter demonstrated great speed in his minor league career. Lombardozzi stole at least 20 bases in three consecutive minor league seasons before joining the Nationals in 2012. Lombardozzi also demonstrated great gap power in the minor leagues and has always carried a strong contact rate. Dustin Ackley, SEA - Fantasy owners clamored to select Ackley early in 2012 drafts following his strong introduction to Seattle. Unfortunately, he produced only a .226 batting average with a sub-.300 OBP. Armed with a new hitting coach and a re-tooling of the lineup, Ackley’s vying for “post-hype sleeper” status this year. Despite his weak batting average, Ackley did generate solid numbers in three other standard categories. He hit 12 home runs, scored 84 runs and stole 13 bases for Seattle last year. Daniel Murphy, Mets - When dealing with fantasy baseball second basemen, the phrase “you could do a lot worse than {name}” is tossed around often after the first few players come off the board. Daniel Murphy finds his name inside the brackets heading into 2013. The Mets’ second baseman hit .291 with six home runs, 62 runs, 65 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 156 games last season. Chase Utley, Phillies - If you are the gambling type, why not wait and take a shot on the 34-year-old Utley? After missing 185 games over the last three seasons (62 games / season), the Phillies second baseman has reportedly looked healthy during offseason conditioning drills and the hope is he can be an everyday player in 2013. While, I wouldn’t hold my breath on that, Bill James has projected Utley a .274 / .372 / .463 with 19 home runs in 122 games this season. The projections are far from stable, but the gambling fantasy owner would be happy with .265 / .355 / .453 with 14 home runs compared to the remaining bottom-tier options. Jose Altuve, Astros - Sorry Houston fans, but this is the only player on the roster I’m willing to draft (admittingly, it will be tough to pass on Jed Lowrie). Fantasy baseball is all about balance and finding the right combination of players to take categories. For 2B, look at runs, stolen bases, and batting average. Altuve finished 1st in SBs (33), 5th in AVG (.290), and 12th in runs (blame that on his team). Jose is entering his third year in the pros and first year in the American League. His stats will only get better with the aid of a DH in the lineup. Marco Scutaro, Giants - I’m not quite sure what happened to Scutaro after joining San Francisco and I’m not asking. Until a PED test proves positive, I’m finding a way to get him on my roster. In only 61 games with the Giants he hit 41 RBI and batted an astounding .362 AVG. The post-All-Star game production by Scutaro helped boost his stats to a career-high level driving in 74 RBI, 20 more than 2011. Last year was also the first time he hit above .300 (.306) and nearly .100 higher after leaving Colorado. Omar Infante, Tigers - Infante to Detroit…take three…action! His stats won’t jump off the page (12 HR, 53 RBI, 17 SB, and .274 AVG in 2012), but if you spend higher picks on other positions Infante can be a great filler and gets the job done at 2B. I tend to shy away from players who bat last in the order (obviously, just a projection right now), but if you miss the run of second basemen in the draft don’t force a pick just to fill a roster spot. Instead, stash Infante on the back burner and wait until other options are fulfilled. It’s highly unlikely fantasy teams will draft two 2B. Dustin Ackley, Mariners - While Seattle general manager Jack Zduriencik is catching a lot of flak for trading John Jaso away in order to acquire Mike Morse, you can’t blame the guy for wanting to boost the AL-worst 619 runs (3.8 per game)his team scored last season. Jesus Montero will now catch full-time and new signees Kendrys Morales and Jason Bay will rotate at DH. Ackley should benefit from all of these roster moves. Dustin recently had surgery to repair left knee issues that seemed to affect his 2012 season. As the leadoff hitter, Ackley had the fifth-most at-bats (607) with his injury compared to other 2B. He’ll get the chances; it’s a matter of what he’ll do with them in 2013. I’d take a flier on him. Jemile Weeks/Scott Sizemore, Athletics - So, I’m clearly cheating by selecting two guys battling for the 2B spot in Oakland. These write-ups take place well before a decision will be made. I like either player as a potential sleeper in 2013. If Sizemore wins the job, his strengths will be HR and RBI. He’s recovering from a torn ACL that caused him to miss the entire 2012 season. In his 93 games with Oakland in 2011, Scott hit .249 with 11 HRs and 52 RBI. Also, he finished second on the team in OPS (.778). If Weeks gets the nod, his biggest strength will be SB. His 2012 turned out to be a sophomore slump. His average dipped from .303 to .221, RBI fell from 36 to 20, and his stolen bases slipped from 22 to 16, all of this happened with 21 more games played, too. There’s potential for Jemile to bounce back and I like his wheels for Team Moneyball. Chase Utley, Phillies – Utley is on the SLEEPER list? Absolutely, since he’s going as the 13th second baseman in early Mock Draft Central drafts, with an ADP of 188. Utley’s health is certainly a risk, but after missing most of the first half of 2012, he hit 11 homers and stole 11 bases in 83 games. I’d have no problems taking a mid-round chance on a potential top-six fantasy second baseman. If things don’t work out on the injury front, you can replace him with one of the guys listed below. Daniel Murphy, Mets – Nothing Murphy does will blow you away, but when you’re looking for late-round value at this wasteland of a fantasy position, try the guy with the .292 career batting average instead of reaching for five extra stolen bases that come with all sorts of BA danger. I’m looking at you, Cliff Pennington. Johnny Giavotella, Royals – Hey, did you know that Giavotella’s aunt runs Gio’s Pizza and Spaghetti House in suburban New Orleans? Mmm … pizza. Anyway, Giavotella will need to compete with Chris Getz for the Royals’ keystone job, but he’s a better hitter, with minor-league numbers that suggest a 10-homer, 10-steal kind of guy. That’s not bad for an endgame option, and his gritty, scrappy, Brett Gardner-ness will make him fun for you to watch. Jedd Gyorko, Padres – The Padres want Gyorko to win their second-base job. He hit 30 homers between Double A and Triple A last season, so fantasy owners should want him to win it as well. Gyorko batted .309 in 2012, so batting average doesn’t appear to be a worry, and the moving in of the outfield fences at PETCO Park can only help. Gyorko might qualify only at third base in some leagues, but FOXSports.com will have him at the keystone from the get-go. Jurickson Profar, Rangers and Kolten Wong, Cardinals – Neither of these guys is expected to start the season in the majors, but you should keep them on your radar. Profar is regarded by many as baseball’s best prospect, but he’s currently blocked by Ian Kinsler and Elvis Andrus in the Rangers’ middle infield. Whenever he comes up – perhaps when Lance Berkman’s knee starts to bark – speed/power fantasy stardom probably won’t be far away. Wong has a much lower ceiling than Profar, but his main obstacle to playing time (Daniel Descalso) is less daunting. He’s a little guy with a good BA – Dustin Pedroia is a widely-mentioned comp – who could be in St. Louis pretty soon.",Raw Data

249,"﻿Chris Wood knows what its like to blow the lead in the final round of a tournament, and he had no intention of doing it again in the Qatar Masters. Needing a birdie on 18 to force a playoff with Sergio Garcia and George Coetzee on Saturday, the 25-year-old Englishman went one better. He landed his 200-yard approach shot 12 feet from the hole and sank the eagle putt for the victory. He finished with a 3-under-par 69 and 18-under 270 for the tournament. ''It feels amazing. It's a dream come true,'' said the 142nd-ranked Wood, who moves into the top 60 with his first European Tour victory in Doha. ''I didn't know the situation when I was on the 18th fairway, but, luckily, I'd hit a great drive and I had the perfect yardage for a 6 iron. I knew I had to just let my swing go and trust it. It's up there as one of the best shots I've ever played, because it was to win a tournament.'' Wood said he was thinking of Tiger Woods — someone who has hit a few tournament-winning shots in his day — just before he hit the shot on 18. ''I remember watching Tiger hit a shot at a tournament a few years ago on 18, an 8 iron to 6 feet, and that was for his first win in a couple of years after he struggled. I watched quite a bit of that, and although he didn't play his best, his attitude was, 'I'm going to win this tournament whatever happens,' '' Wood said. ''I had that in the back of my mind, to just let my swing go and no matter how it feels, trust the swing, commit to it, and I hit a really good shot there.'' Wood came into the final day with a comfortable three-shot lead over former US Open champion Michael Campbell, Simon Khan and Alexander Noren. He had been here before and it had ended badly — in 2011 at the Iberdrola Open in Majorca, he came into the final day with a four-shot lead but scored a 76 to lose by three to Darren Clarke. Early on, Wood appeared to be faltering once again. He missed a 4-foot birdie putt on No. 2 and then double-bogeyed the par-3 third. He hit his tee shot into a sandy, waste area and then a chip failed to clear a wall. He rebounded with a birdie on No. 5 but then bogeyed the next hole to open the door for Coetzee and later Garcia. ''On the third, I tried to get it up and over the wall but it ricocheted back and it turned out to be a good 5,'' Wood said. ''That actually settled me down a bit, surprisingly.'' The 48th-ranked Coetzee, also looking for his first European Tour win, had three birdies on the final four holes on the front nine and then eagled the 10th to take a two-shot lead. His approach shot on the 10th bounced on the fringe and rolled to a few feet, setting up the easy eagle putt. ''It's always good if you can hold the lead on the final day because it's very difficult,'' Coetzee said. ''I thought to myself, 'All I have to do is get past 15 and make him shoot a number.' And luckily for him, he did.'' Garcia got into the hunt with his much-improved short game, carding six birdies on his final 11 holes. His tee shot on the par-3 17th rolled to 3 feet, and his birdie putt left him one shot behind. On the 18th, the Spaniard hit a long wedge shot for another birdie chance, which he converted to tie Coetzee for the lead. ''I gave it my best effort,'' said Garcia, who could have moved into the top 10 with a win. ''The last 10 or 11 holes were good. The first six holes, I didn't feel great with my swing, and you could see it.'' These golfers weren't smoking anything when they picked out their outfits. But you might think otherwise when you see what they wore. Wood recovered with some clutch putting, sinking long birdie putts on Nos. 8, 9 and 14. He saved par on the 15th after his approach shot went into the rough and then just missed a 20-footer for birdie on the 16th. He missed another good birdie chance on No. 17, leaving him a shot behind with one hole to play. The win was Wood's second overall — after a victory on the Asian Tour in Thailand last year — and gives him a sense that he finally has turned the corner after 116 European Tour events. ''I got to about 65th or something a couple of years ago, but since then I've had all the problems with my back and I've struggled a little bit,'' Wood said. ''But I always knew that I would be getting back just in my own time, and I'm absolutely desperate for it. It definitely opens the door to a few more things and now I can set a couple of different targets for the next few months.'' Steve Webster (68) and Noren (71) finished four shots back in a tie for fourth, with Webster ending his chances with a double-bogey on 15. Three others including Branden Grace (71) finished a further shot back in a tie for sixth. Grace, a rising South African star who won four tournaments last year, gave himself a chance with an eagle on the 10th but had two bogeys to fall back before he birdied the 18th.",Raw Data

252,"GARY ALEXANDER has told everyone at AFC Wimbledon to stick together in their bid to escape the drop. he striker, on loan from Crawley, netted a last-gasp winner for the League's bottom side to send Dons fans into ecstasy and dent the Wembley build-up for Bradford. Wimbledon's home form has been so poor that the win was their ?rst since October and their ?rst on a Saturday since the opening day. ""We've just got to stick together and take the rough with the smooth, and hopefully at the end of the season we've done enough,"" said Alexander. ""To nick a 90th minute winner is fantastic, and it's a big buzz for the lads for Tuesday against Northampton. ""We needed that win, and obviously we've got the monkey off our back at home. ""I can't credit the team enough. Going a goal behind we could have quite easily folded. But we came back at them and scored the goal, and it gave us a little bit of a lift."" While Bradford will spend this week preparing for Swansea, Wimbledon face two more crucial games, against the Cobblers and Dagenham. ""It's de?nitely a springboard for us for the rest of the season,"" added Alexander. ""We know what we've got to do we've got 15 games. We've spoken about it as a bunch of lads, and we've had it out in the last couple of weeks. ""There are ?ve or six teams down there, obviously we're one of them and we want to pick up points and put the other teams under pressure."" The Dons have been struggling at the wrong end of the Football League for most of the season, due in part to letting in sloppy goals. Alan Bennett was the guilty party this time, heading short towards Neil Sullivan and allowing Gary Thompson in for his fourth goal of the season. However, with seven minutes left, sub Jack Midson grabbed his 10th goal of the season to give Wimbledon a glimmer of hope. The crunch came right on the ?nal whistle, when Alexander bundled home to send Dons fans wild. The result was a painful one for the Bantams, who certainly did not take it easy before their big date at Wembley. Having kept the same side that beat Wycombe 3-0 in the week, boss Phil Parkinson admitted it was tempting to make major changes for Sunday's ? nal. ""If we change things too much that will be the wrong thing to do we will train as normal and prepare as professionally as we can,"" he said. ""We are going to enjoy the experience and the lads deserve it they have worked exceptionally hard. ""Swansea are an outstanding football team so we won't have much of the ball. We will have a real go and that is all we can do. ""I don't think Wembley showed in the way we played. ""We were good all round we were strong, and I couldn't fault the lads today.

253,"Bet on Golf How many days will they last? Will their golf be good enough to win in Wednesday's opening round? Can they still advance after a slightly off-day? Will the putts drop at the right time? ""When I was packing my bags the other night, I'm thinking, 'How many shirts did I bring? How many pairs of pants?' This is always a fun event,"" world number one Rory McIlroy told reporters on a sunny, breezy day at Dove Mountain on Tuesday. ""It's one of those weeks where you've just got to try and get through every round, and you face different opposition every day. I'm looking forward to it. I love the golf course here. ""It's a great course for match play. You can be really aggressive and make a lot of birdies,"" added Northern Ireland's McIlroy, who has been drawn to play Irishman Shane Lowry in Wednesday's opening round. Matchplay is much more unpredictable than strokeplay and because of the extraordinary depth in the global game, anyone in this week's elite 64-man field is capable of winning the title. ""There are no weak players in this tournament and no easy matches,"" said Britain's former world number one Lee Westwood, who did not reach the third round in his first 11 appearances at the event before getting to the semi-finals last year. ""Very rarely do you get given one (a win) in this, and that's the idea for tomorrow, just to try and turn up and play well. Hopefully it's good enough. ""And hopefully the guy doesn't blitz it and hole everything and chip in and frustrate you like that. You do need a bit more luck in this event than in other ones."" CAREFREE GOLF Asked if he changed his strategy going into last year's Match Play where he eventually lost 3&1 to McIlroy in the last four, Westwood replied: ""Other than not really putting too much pressure on myself to try and get going in the tournament, no. ""Just try to play carefree golf sort of and see what happened."" Tiger Woods is a three-times winner of the event but he has also suffered early disappointment, losing on the opening day in 2002 and 2011 and going out in the second round in 2005, 2009 and last year. ""Anybody can beat anybody at this level,"" said the former world number one. ""That's what makes it so interesting for us as players. It is a sprint, it is a boat race. You have to get off to quick starts. ""Generally if you get down early, two or three down, you rarely come back. It's hard to make up ground when you're only playing 18 holes,"" added Woods, who plays fellow American Charles Howell III in the first round. Hunter Mahan will be defending the title he won last year with a 2&1 victory over McIlroy in the final but he also knows the pain of losing in the opening round, having been eliminated by South African Charl Schwartzel at the first hurdle in 2010. ""It's a weird feeling,"" American Mahan said of the long, uphill journey by van from the course back to the clubhouse after being ousted. ""You just want to get out of there. ""The van can't move fast enough. People can't get out of the way fast enough. Everything bothers you. And if someone asks you, 'How was your day?' you want to punch them in the face."" McIlroy, Woods, 2011 champion Luke Donald of Britain and South African Louis Oosthuizen are the top seeds in the four groups of 16 for this week's event. World number three Donald will launch his campaign against Germany's Marcel Siem while fifth-ranked South African Oosthuizen takes on Briton Richie Ramsay in the first round.

254,"NEWARK, Del. -- Elena Delle Donne is used to the physical toll. The University of Delaware's 6-foot-5 All-American is familiar with all that comes with being better and bigger than anyone else on the basketball court -- the clutching and grabbing, the elbows and forearms that find their way into the small of her back but go uncalled. Watching Delle Donne with the ball in the post or as she drives the lane is as close as basketball comes to what cameras capture of the underwater mayhem that makes Olympic water polo must-see television every four years. She went to the free throw line nearly eight times per game last season; she could have gone at least that many times each half. It's part of the deal, and when your team goes 31-2, spends a good part of the season ranked in the top 10, wins a conference title and gets visits from the vice president, the bumps and bruises aren't so bad. But the defensive dark arts aren't all that will take a toll on Delle Donne's body in her final college season. There is one more twist for her to navigate. “ For it to flare up for my senior year -- it's disappointing, but I'm not going to let it stop me from playing. I'm going to be out on the court if I can. ” -- Elena Delle Donne, who has had Lyme disease since 2008 With the start of the regular season just a week away, Delle Donne told espnW she is experiencing a recurrence of symptoms of Lyme disease, the same illness that forced her out of the lineup for 12 games during the 2010-11 season. Although she experienced sporadic symptoms last season and remained on medication for the disease, she was for the most part healthy as a junior. The results were otherworldly, one of the greatest statistical seasons on record. She averaged 28.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game while shooting 52 percent from the field, 41 percent from the 3-point line and 89 percent from the free throw line, turning over the ball fewer than two times per game. But when full practices began several weeks ago, Delle Donne felt the return of familiar symptoms, which can include extreme fatigue, migraine-like headaches and anything from mild to debilitating pain in muscles and joints (hold your arms out in front of you for a few seconds; now imagine not having the strength to keep them there). ""After last season, I thought I was kind of clearing it and thought it was going to be over with,"" Delle Donne said. ""I even started going off medicines in the summer because I was doing so well. And then for it to flare up for my senior year -- it's disappointing, but I'm not going to let it stop me from playing. I'm going to be out on the court if I can."" She said if the opener against Sam Houston State had been this Friday, instead of a week away, she would have been in uniform and on the court for the preseason WNIT game. ""I don't feel great, and I don't always look great,"" Delle Donne said, ""but I'd play."" She is taking a new round of medication in consultation with the specialist she has seen for two years. She is practicing; Delaware coach Tina Martin finds Delle Donne before practice each day, and sometimes again during practice, and asks a simple question: good day or bad day? They go from there. There will be a litany of small challenges to overcome -- things like keeping on enough weight to withstand the punishment she takes on the court. But unlike two years ago, when she cautioned that she wasn't sure if 100 percent was a realistic option after she returned, she is hopeful it is now. ""I'm optimistic that at some point in the season I will be,"" Delle Donne said. ""Right now, I'm not at all. But I've played at not 100 percent for a lot of games before, and it's something I'm used to. It's something I'm willing to deal with."" [+] Enlarge Evan Habeeb/US PresswireElena Delle Donne led the nation in scoring last season with 28.1 points per game. Delle Donne originally contracted the bacterial disease known to be spread by bites from infected blacklegged ticks in 2008, during the summer in which she returned home from the University of Connecticut. Antibiotics were prescribed, but because they hurt her throat, Delle Donne said she stopped taking them a week earlier than directed, something she believes allowed the disease to linger dormant within her. When symptoms reappeared in 2010, they were more severe than anything she had experienced two years before, at times leaving her physically unable to get out of bed. She played the first eight games that season while feeling the full effects of fatigue and pain, but in tears after a game at Penn State, a contest in which she scored 25 points on 9-of-23 shooting in 37 minutes, she told her parents she couldn't take it any longer. But two years had passed, and Lyme disease wasn't on the radar in explaining her misery. In the weeks that followed, the search for answers led down some rather dark paths. At one point, Delle Donne's father, Ernie, said a doctor told him that his best guess was either Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, or a brain tumor. These weren't just basketball-threatening maladies. ""I was scared, really scared,"" Elena Delle Donne said. ""My family, obviously it was great being with my family at that point in time because they were taking care of me the best they could, but they were also there for me mentally, where I was like, 'I could be dying.' That's what I felt like; I felt like I was dying. No doctors knew what it was."" Six weeks later, the recurrence of Lyme diagnosed, she was back on the court, scoring 28 points in her return. Neither she nor the program seemingly ever looked back. The Blue Hens drew fewer than a thousand fans to the Bob Carpenter Center for all but two home games during the season before Delle Donne decided to return to basketball. The school has already sold more than 2,000 season tickets for the upcoming campaign and expects to be close to a capacity of around 5,000 most nights. The team is ranked No. 11 in the AP preseason poll and returns most of its core. All of that is just fine with Delle Donne, the competitor within her craving the challenge, just as she takes the physical punishment from opponents, rarely says a word and keeps piling up points. But the flip side of the phenomenon that is Delaware women's basketball is the specter of disappointing a community if she is unable to meet her own standards, a dilemma that could tempt her to push her body too far. ""It's a really difficult thing to not let people down,"" Delle Donne said. ""No one even knows about [the disease] that much. They thought I had it, and then they thought I got better and it was gone. And especially after last season, I was fine through most of the season, had a couple of flare-ups, but no one knew about it. ""It's a difficult thing to handle when people think you're going to be on top of your game, 100 percent, and you know with the illness you just can't be."" Speaking one night after somehow procuring a Gumby costume that fit her frame in order to partake in Halloween celebrations, and before heading home to cram for an exam the following day, Delle Donne still seems, to her great satisfaction, to be just another college student. Basketball is only one part of that. But someone who once ran from college basketball begins her final season doing everything she can to stay on the court. The toll is one she's willing to pay.",Raw Data
255,"John Beilein isn't going to celebrate when Michigan officially becomes the top-ranked team in the nation Monday morning. After 20 years, though, he knows that his fan base is going to enjoy it. ""This is great for our fans and it is going to be great for the coffee shops tomorrow,"" Beilein said on the postgame radio show following the Wolverines' 74-60 victory at Illinois on Sunday. ""Those are the people that are helping us sell out every game we play, home and away."" Michigan entered the game knowing that, with No. 1 Duke having lost earlier in the week, a victory in Champaign would almost certainly move the Wolverines into the top spot. The key was making sure not to care. ""Yeah, I think we're the No. 1 team right now,"" said Trey Burke, who finished with 19 points. ""But you don't get a banner for being No. 1 in January."" At 19-1 overall and 6-1 in the Big Ten, the Wolverines are having their best season since the Fab Five reached No. 1 in 1992. But like that team, it won't matter if they don't win something in March. ""No one remembers who was No. 1 at the end of January last season, but everyone remembers who won the national championship,"" Beilein said. ""I know this sounds like coach-speak, but this team is really focused on taking things one game at a time. ""If we keep getting better a day at a time, we'll have a chance to do what we want to do win a Big Ten championship and a national championship."" Things got off to a rough start for the Wolverines when Jordan Morgan badly sprained his ankle in the first 90 seconds. That meant more minutes for freshman Mitch McGary as well as little-used Max Bielfeldt and injury-prone Jon Horford. They combined for 17 points and 14 rebounds. ""The team needed me to step up when J-Mo went down, and it felt great to be able to do that,"" said Horford, who only returned this week from a knee injury. ""Jordan's been a huge part of this team for the last few years, but we know that we've got guys who can man up and do the job if he needs us."" Morgan didn't return to the game, so Bielfeldt and Horford could be seeing more action in upcoming games. ""I'm really proud of Max and Jon tonight,"" Beilein said. ""Max has been dying for minutes, and Jon has been fighting through injuries and fighting through injuries. ""Jordan's got a pretty good sprain in that ankle, so they're going to be out there."" The Illini looked like a solid Big Ten force when they routed Ohio State at home on Jan. 5, but they've lost four of five since then. On Sunday, the Wolverines did to them what they've done to teams all season, grinding them down on both ends. Michigan shot better than 50 percent, held Illinois to 37 percent, forced turnovers and kept the Illini off the free-throw line. ""To win championships in the Big Ten, you have to be able to do this,"" Beilein said. ""You have to be able to go into a loud arena and win games. That's why this team is good. We're able to do that."" In a notoriously tough place to play, Michigan got a combined 32 points from McGary and his fellow freshmen, Glenn Robinson III and Nik Stauskas. ""We knew that it was going to get loud in here when Illinois got on any kind of run, and we had told the freshmen what to expect,"" Burke said. ""But they did a great job of keeping their poise, no matter how crazy the fans got in here. They did a damn good job tonight."" The only bad news from Michigan's talented first-year class might have been Robinson's 12 points, seven rebounds and one spectacular (unofficial) block. Robinson ran down an Illini fast break and swatted away a teardrop jumper at the top of its arc a play that, even if he didn't get credited with a block in the box score, is going to have NBA teams paying even more attention to his short-term future. ""Glenn was everywhere in the first half on both ends of the floor,"" Beilein said. ""He was making shots, grabbing rebounds and he has turned into a great defender. That was a very good performance from him."" Like Burke, Robinson isn't likely to have a lengthy college career. But on a team that looks this much like a title contender, having a couple guys playing at an NBA level is a pretty good problem to have.",Raw Data
256,"• Five wins — including a major, the PGA at Kiawah Island — in 24 starts across the world and nine other top-five finishes, including four runner-ups. • Won both the PGA Tour and European Tour money titles, earning $11,953,586 to break Tiger Woods' 2007 single-season money record of $10,867,052. • Extended his lead in the official world golf rankings to 4.33 points over No. 2 Luke Donald, a margin not seen since Woods dominated golf. • Won both the PGA of America’s Vardon Trophy for lowest scoring average and the PGA Tour’s Byron Nelson award for the lowest adjusted scoring average. “He’s on another stratosphere from everyone else right now,” said Graeme McDowell. What’s remarkable about McIlroy’s feats is that he was mired in a slump for two months in the early summer. It seems so long ago now, but there were serious doubts about him then. He bristled at questions about whether he was spending too much time with tennis player girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki and not enough time on the practice tee. Of course, no one’s questioning the 23-year-old now. “He's young, very athletic, got a great swing, seems to work hard at it, seems to have that desire, all the things that you need to succeed out here on a regular basis,” said veteran Steve Stricker. “And he's got to have a lot of confidence from doing what he's been doing, winning both money titles from this year. He seems to have a great head on his shoulders, which we all know in this game you need. You can't do some of the things he's done without thinking properly. “You would have thought that he would have been scarred a little bit after shooting 80 at (2011 Masters), but he comes back and wins the very next major. So, obviously, he's got it all. You know, I've been fortunate enough to play with him a few times, and he's got a lot of game. It's fun to watch, and, yeah, he's going to be around for a while.” In a conference call Tuesday morning, the world No. 1 reflected on his growth as a player. “Over the past 18 months, especially after winning the US Open, I sort of felt like I went to the next level or the next stage of my career,” he said. “I feel like my personality away from the golf course hasn't changed, but definitely when I get to the golf course I'm maybe a little more professional, a little more businesslike and go about my business like that. “But I guess that's just the way you have to be to be successful and to try and win as many tournaments as you can.” The question now becomes this: How much better can he get? “I've sort of had to answer that question a lot the last few weeks: What can you do next season to try and get better and what would be a success next season compared to this one?” he said. “I guess it's just trying to become a better golfer, a better player, maybe add more variety to my game, add a couple more shots here and there. “I still feel like I can improve in all aspects of the game. And if I can do that, and my focus is on that, then, hopefully, the tournament wins and the success will come.” Like his boyhood hero, Tiger Woods, McIlroy sees the four majors as his priority. “What was disappointing this year for me, if there was a disappointment, is that I was only in contention once in the majors. And, luckily, I was able to win it,” he said. What happens when a rising golf superstar and a top tennis player start dating? A romance that spans the globe. “But next year I'd love to be in contention in all four of them and have a chance to win all. Not saying I'm going to win all of them, but at least give myself a chance.” Those are Tiger-level ambitions, but after winning two majors by eight strokes, perhaps not totally far-fetched. What this year has taught us is that when McIlroy’s on his game, he’s unstoppable. If there’s a next step for the amiable Northern Irishman, it’s that he’ll have to learn to do what Woods mastered – winning without his A game.",Raw Data
257,"Kobe Bryant made all the big passes. Steve Nash scored important points down the stretch. Pau Gasol excelled off the bench as the new-look Lakers calmly maintained a fourth-quarter lead on the mighty Oklahoma City Thunder. Bryant had 21 points, 14 assists and nine rebounds, Nash added seven of his 17 points in the final 5 1/2 minutes, and the Lakers held off the NBA-leading Thunder 105-96 Sunday. Gasol scored 16 points in a reserve role as the Lakers picked up the most impressive victory of their thoroughly unimpressive season, coolly maintaining a small lead down the stretch of their second straight win after a four-game skid. With Bryant taking on a playmaking role, Nash stepping up his offensive game and Dwight Howard preaching togetherness, the 19-25 Lakers are cautiously optimistic their latest reboot will work - and even the Thunder were impressed. ''We're doing a good job right now of just being real with each other and holding each other accountable,'' said Bryant, who had 14 assists and fell one rebound shy of a triple-double in each of the past two games. ''That makes a huge difference. I'm trying to evolve and find out what we need as a ballclub.'' Who's down and who's up in the NBA? We rank all 30 teams. So is everybody else with the Lakers, who had lost nine of their last 11 against the defending Western Conference champion Thunder, including four of five in the clubs' second-round playoff series last spring and a blowout loss at Staples Center 16 days ago. The Lakers have strung together two solid games at home since a clear-the-air team meeting in Memphis last week. ''We've found something that works, that's for sure, and something we can feel good about,'' said Gasol, who played 36 minutes. ''I think the way we are playing, we can be very successful.'' Kevin Durant scored 35 points and Russell Westbrook had 17 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds for the road-weary Thunder, who finished their longest trip of the season at 3-3. Durant could sense the Lakers' desperation in their fourth-quarter effort. ''The whole arena felt that way,'' the three-time NBA scoring champion said. ''They needed a win. It was a must-win for them, and they came out and performed well. They were hitting shots, and they were doing a good job of protecting the paint. We missed some good shots as well. As a group, we all have to do our roles better. Every individual has to play their role to a T for us to win games, but we'll be fine.'' Bryant and Westbrook briefly tangled in the third quarter in an exchange that earned a technical foul for Kobe. Both All-Star guards entered the fourth quarter needing just one rebound for a triple-double, but neither got it. Westbrook missed his first eight shots and 12 of his first 13 before finding a rhythm, but the Lakers didn't wilt down the stretch. ''The thought the execution at the end of the game by our team definitely could have been better,'' Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks said. ''It's something that we're pretty good at, but a lot of that had to do with their team. They're a physical team, and they were moving us around a little bit towards the end.'' Los Angeles took the lead with 6:15 to play on a jumper by Metta World Peace, who had 15 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers nursed a small advantage in the final minutes, going up 101-95 on Gasol's driving layup with 1:09 to play. Bryant then hit a tough 19-foot jumper with 37 seconds left, and Westbrook couldn't answer. Durant didn't have a field goal in the final 6:39, scoring just seven points in the fourth quarter of Oklahoma City's third loss in 11 games. Oklahoma City routed the Lakers earlier this month, with Durant scoring 42 points and Westbrook adding 27 while Los Angeles played without Howard and Gasol. Howard had just eight points and 10 rebounds this time out while fighting foul trouble and missing eight of his 10 free throws. Bryant and Nash led a passionate effort by the Lakers, whose season-long missteps and embarrassments have left them well out of the playoff picture heading into the second half of the season. ''I'm very excited to see our progress,'' Howard said. ''We're going to continue to work, continue to talk to each other. The biggest difference is we're holding each other accountable for everything. We had a great talk in Memphis, and it's carried over.'' NOTES: The clubs conclude their season series in Oklahoma City on March 5. ... Lakers owner Jerry Buss celebrated his 79th birthday. The Basketball Hall of Famer hasn't attended a game this season while dealing with health concerns. ...

258,"Ali Carter picked the perfect moment to produce his best snooker of the week as he rallied from two frames down to claim victory over Marco Fu in the final of the German Masters in Berlin. World Championship. Click here to bet. The 33-year-old, who saw off Neil Robertson in the semi-finals, prevailed 9-6 in the best-of-17-frame match to claim the third ranking title of his career. Carter trailed 5-3 after today's opening session but emerged from his dressing room this evening with all guns blazing, the Essex cueman opening with his first century of the week with a 116 before following up with a 121 to level at 5-5. Fu, who defeated Barry Hawkins in the last four, fell just short of a 147 break earlier today as he began the final in fine form, but it was a different story following the resumption. He failed to get on the scoreboard in either of the session's opening two frames, and again failed to pot a ball in the next as Carter scored well to lead in the match for the first time at 6-5. Hong Kong's Fu eventually ended his potting drought after 86 long minutes before going on to take the 12th frame on the colours to draw level at 6-6 going in to the mid-session interval. A fine 71 clearance saw Carter restore his lead, however, before he prevailed in a low-scoring 14th to move to within one frame of the title at 8-6. With Fu's safety game going awry along with his potting, the writing appeared to be on the wall and Carter duly did the necessary in the next, prevailing in another scrappy frame to claim the title, adding to his ranking wins at the 2009 Welsh Open and 2010 Shanghai Masters. ""It was tough out there tonight,"" Carter told Eurosport. ""Marco struggled a bit. We were both keen to put on a good show for the crowd, and I'm delighted to come out the winner at the end of the week. ""Things have turned around for me massively. I just give it my all, it is very satisfying to come out the winner here."" Fu was disappointed to fade so badly this evening, particularly after coming close to a 147 earlier in the match. Leading 2-1, the 35-year-old potted 13 reds with blacks to move towards the magical maximum, but the clearance broke down when he missed the penultimate red on 104. ""Ali played very well tonight so all credit to him,"" said Fu, who was contesting his first major final since 2008. ""I just didn't play very well tonight, and was faced with a lot of tough shots. ""It is nice to be in the final again. The crowd have been great this week. Hopefully, I can come back next year and win it.""",Raw Data
259,"That Antonio McDyess 1,000th game appearance, as a starter, came against the Pistons, was some sort of poetic justice for Dice. In a way, the way he played, even though it was against his old team, affirmed the confidence that Joe Dumars had in him when he might have saved his career by signing him to play for the Pistons in the 2004-05 season. Antonio had missed virtually three years because of injuries and I think when you have the kind of staff the Pistons have medically, and especially Arnie Kander as your strength and conditioning coach, you know if anybody can get a guy on the court again, you can. Thankfully, for the Pistons sake and Antonios, it worked out so well. When you play in 1,000 games in the NBA, youve made a great statement about your talent, your mental toughness and your durability. I dont know where Dice would have been without the faith the Pistons had in him, but nobody is more deserving of that than Antonio. He might be the most likeable player in the NBA. We have great guys sprinkled throughout the league and certainly on our team, but nobody who is better liked than Dice. Dont forget what Ben Wallace said earlier this year when Dice was on his way into town with the Spurs to play at The Palace. He said if anybody doesnt like Antonio McDyess, then Ive got a problem with him. I would say it a little differently. It reminds me of the old Sara Lee commercial: Everybody doesnt like something, but nobody doesnt like Sara Lee. Id say everyone doesnt like somebody, but nobody doesnt like Antonio McDyess. Thats why wed all be smiling from ear to ear if he wins a championship ring this year. Playing at the level at which hes playing in his 15th season, with all the injuries hes had, is amazing. He didnt get a ceremonial start against the Pistons for his 1,000th game. Gregg Popovich said that was a basketball decision. That could be the lineup you see the Spurs use into the postseason as they make a run at a fifth championship. And I think they have a very good chance to win. The more you see of that team, with their poise and veteran stars and solid bench, you know they have a legitimate chance to win it all. More often than not, you win championships with great veterans. Tim Duncan is an all-time great and Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili are NBA All-Stars who know how to take the ball and run with it. When theyre the only one of the big three on the court, they know its their job to control the ball and make plays. They did that to the Pistons last night. If Tony Parker doesnt make that late killer 3-pointer, the Pistons would have had a real chance to come back and win that game. Now if you turn the page to the next stop on our trip, here in Oklahoma City, you see how great young players can help a team come out of nowhere and make waves like the Thunder did last year when they pushed the Lakers to the brink as the eighth seed in the West. They now look like a team that will have home-court advantage in round one. Theyre a team that starts, of course, with Kevin Durant. His ability to score and score when it counts its a lot easier to score in the first three quarters than it is in the fourth can win games for you down the stretch. Kevin Durant, as evidenced by his play in Philadelphia last night, when he scored the game-tying 3-pointer to force overtime, is one of those special kind of scorers. Then you have Russell Westbrook, who has matured into a truly solid NBA point guard from a young guy who had incredible ability and strength and quickness and has found a way to harness it all. You always had to be impressed with the way he could score and rebound for a point guard, plus pass the ball, but there was always that turnover column you had to pay attention to. Those days are in the rear-view mirror. Hes a player. The greatest compliment you can give to him is you can win a championship with Russell Westbrook as your point guard. And you can tell that the Thunder front office is thinking championship now. You dont make a trade for a big man like Kendrick Perkins and then sign him to a contract extension if youre not serious. As much as I like to watch Perkins, Im just as glad for the Pistons sake that hes not playing tomorrow night. When he gets back on the court in a couple of weeks, the Thunder will be ready to prove they can play with anybody. Now can they win a seven-game series against a great team? I guess well find out.",Raw Data
260,"Last night Kevin Garnett announced that the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston will be his last. For nearly a decade Garnett, the “Big Ticket” has been playing with levels of intensity, competitiveness, and a gumption to win that few players in NBA history can claim to match. Garnett was never concerned with making friends in his pursuit of a NBA Championship. After only being able to come within a win of the reaching the NBA Finals with the Minnesota Timberwolves Garnett was saved from early playoff exits and bitter disappointments when he was traded to the Boston Celtics. Although Garnett has not officially announced his retirement it can be safely presumed that this season may be his last. But when that day comes which franchise will hang his jersey from their rafters? Minnesota Timberwolves? Boston Celtics? During his time in Minnesota Garnett won a MVP, set a number of franchise records, 2-time defensive player of the year and was an eight-time All-Star. However, in his short stint with Celtics he restored a franchise mired in mediocrity by helping to bring a NBA Championship to a city that had become accustomed with disappointment. Mone/AP Has his short stint with the Celtics overshadowed the dominance that he displayed as the alpha dog with the Timberwolves? Never one to be concerned with accolades and awards Garnett will be truly missed and as NBA scouts and personnel continue to search for the next Garnett, the unemployment line of ex-NBA general managers who have failed will continue to grow. The reality is that Garnett was a once in a generation athlete that may be imitated but never duplicated or replicated because there is and never will be another one quite like him. The Garnett farewell tour starts in Houston during All-Star weekend the country boy from South Carolina has shown certainly shown us that anything is possible.

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. The Pittsburgh Penguins needed about seven minutes to make the Wells Fargo Center as quiet as the other 29 NHL arenas the past three months with goals by Tyler Kennedy and James Neal. We get after everything you need to know on every division, every team. Despite the lockout that threatened the season, Philadelphia Flyers fans, eventually, made their presence known. This place was sold out for a 3-1 Penguins victory, one of 13 games that kicked off the NHL’s abbreviated 48-game regular-season schedule on Saturday. “They have a lot of loyal fans and a lot of people who love their team here,” Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. “It was great to see that we’re still getting the turnout that we’re getting.” That’s in Philly, where fans would walk through the turnstiles whenever the owners and players agreed to halt the third work stoppage in the NHL over the last 20 years. And full arenas like this one will be the norm — at least in most NHL markets — this weekend. That’s not to say this latest stoppage won’t have an impact. It already has. The NHL has moved further outside the consciousness of the average sports fan. But had a fringe hockey fan or somebody new to the sport entered the building, he or she may not have noticed that we weren’t in the middle of an 82-game schedule. “Thank your fans!” was not scribbled on the ice like had been after the last lockout, which cost the entire 2004-05 season. The play wasn’t crisp, although nothing worse than if both teams had come off long road trips in the middle of a grueling season. “We knew it was going to be a little sloppy,” said Neal, the Penguins forward who made it 2-0 with a goal 7:20 into the contest. “Guys are still trying to get their timing down. It’s been a long time since we’ve been in a game situation. “We knew we weren’t going to come here like it was Game 6 of the playoffs where we’d whip the puck around making great passes. We knew we’d be scrambling.” Flyers fans who wore the free orange “Let’s go!” T-shirts still disliked the Penguins star center as always, and the “Crosby Sucks!” chant began early. Philadelphia became the latest team to offer a tiding, following half-price tickets, free jerseys along with merchandise and concession discounts announced by other teams after the owners and players agreed to a new collective-bargaining agreement. The lockout centered around the owners’ desire to cut the players' take of league revenues, limits to contract lengths and revenue sharing. The two sides agreed in principle to a 10-year deal (either can side can opt out after eight years) on Jan. 6 and the players followed the owners in ratifying the deal in Jan. 12 — leaving a just week for training camp before play began. Maybe the Flyers had a week and one period. ""The first period was kind of ugly,” said new Flyers captain Claude Giroux, who scored Philly’s lone goal, in the second period. “Guys were trying to get their legs back. Things were a little sloppy.” Don’t worry, the sloppiness should disappear. It’s only the first game and, sadly, a large part of Saturday’s crowd probably didn’t notice anyway.",Raw Data

Novak Djokovic got the better of rival Andy Murray this time, winning the 2013 Australian Open men's final. See the photos. He has won four of his six majors titles at at Melbourne Park, where he is now unbeaten in 21 matches. Born a week apart in May 1987 and friends since their junior playing days, the two played like they knew each other's game very well in a rematch of last year's U.S. Open final won by Murray. There were no service breaks until the eighth game of the third set, when Djokovic finally broke through and then held at love to lead by two sets to one. Djokovic earned two more service breaks in the fourth set, including one to take a 4-1 lead when Murray double-faulted on break point. The 25-year-old Serb didn't rip his shirt off this time, as he did to celebrate his epic 5-hour, 53-minute win over Rafael Nadal in last year's final. He just did a little dance, looked up to the sky and then applauded the crowd after the 3-hour, 40-minute match. Murray's win over Djokovic in the U.S. Open final last year ended a 76-year drought for British men at the majors, but he still is yet to make a breakthrough in Australia after losing a third final here in the last four years. Djokovic's win went against the odds of recent finals at Melbourne Park. In four of the past five years, the player who won his semifinal second has won the tournament. But this year, Djokovic played his semifinal on Thursday - an easy three-set, 89-minute minute win over No. 4-seeded David Ferrer. Murray needed five energy sapping sets to beat 17-time major winner Roger Federer on Friday night. The win consolidated Djokovic's position as the No. 1-ranked player in the world, while Federer and Murray will be second and third when the ATP rankings are released Monday. Their last two matches in Grand Slams - Murray's five-set win at last year's U.S. Open and Djokovic's victory here last year in five in the semifinals - had a total of 35 service breaks. It was a vastly different, more tactical battle on Sunday, with the first two tight sets decided in tiebreakers. Murray, who called for a trainer to retape blisters on his right foot at the end of the second set, was visibly annoyed by noise from the crowd during his service games in the third set, stopping his service motion twice until the crowd quieted down. After dropping the third set, he complained about the noise to chair umpire John Blom. Djokovic also appeared frustrated at times, kicking the ball football-style back over the net after he hit a forehand long during a lengthy point, and muttering to himself while sitting down in his chair during changeovers. But both players were guilty of making unforced errors, often ending long rallies with shots into the net or long. Murray's fans came dressed for the occasion, with some wearing ''Braveheart''-style wigs, Scottish flags painted on their faces and tartan caps. One group of men wore white T-shirts with black letters that spelled out A-N-D-Y; they serenaded Murray at the start of the first two sets. There were a number of Serbian shirts, caps and flags in the stadium, as well as fans calling ''Ajde!'' or ''Come on!'' in Serbian to support Djokovic. Retired NBA basketball star Vlade Divac was sitting in Djokovic's box. Djokovic looked agitated after failing to convert the break points in the first set, frequently looking up to his box and yelling at the members of his team and himself. Although Djokovic went into the match with a 10-7 lead in head-to-heads, Murray had beaten Djokovic five out of eight times in tiebreakers, and that improved to six of nine after four unforced errors by Djokovic to end the first set. Djokovic pegged back that edge in the second set, when Murray also didn't help his cause by double-faulting to give Djokovic a 3-2 lead, and the Serbian player didn't trail again in the tiebreaker. He leveled the match after nearly 2 hours, 15 minutes. Andre Agassi was among those in the capacity crowd at Rod Laver Arena - the four-time Australian champion's first trip Down Under in nearly 10 years - and he later presented the trophy to Djokovic. Victoria Azarenka, who won Saturday's women's singles final over Li Na, was in the crowd with her boyfriend rapper Redfoo. Actor Kevin Spacey, who met in the dressing room with both players ahead of the match and later tweeted a photo of himself with them, also was in attendance for the third straight night.

LIVERPOOL new-boy Philippe Coutinho is on course to become the Kops new samba star after an impressive full debut. Fellow Brazilian and Lucas Leiva played alongside Coutinho in Liverpools 5-0 demolition of Swansea on Sunday. And Lucas has nothing but praise for the way in which the 20-year-old attacking midfielder has settled in following his £8.5m January move from Inter Milan. Coutinho scored against Swansea and Lucas said: We could see good things from him. He will be a great player. He will need time to settle in but scoring that goal will give him confidence. He is still adapting. Ive been talking to him about the pace of the Premier League. Even in training, he can feel it is much quicker than Italy. Coutinho found first-team chances scarce at Inter Milan, playing just 21 senior games in three years. He moved to Espanyol on loan this season, playing 16 times before the move to Liverpool. Lucas said: At Inter, he didnt get the opportunities he thought he would get. Here this is a new challenge for him. He has settled very well and it will help him that there are a few South American players here. But he will definitely need time.

The Reds are trailing 2-0 from last weeks first leg  a result that came just three days after a shock home Premier League defeat at the hands of West Brom. Lucas said: We started last week thinking it could be very good for us but we had the defeats against West Brom and then in the Europa League. But we finished it well, scoring five goals and having a clean sheet. We know that we need to improve a lot. It just gives us a bit of confidence to go into Thursday, so we can try to get through.

Friday sees the competitors show off their free programmes with the two scores then totalled together and, with Newberry favouring that routine, the chance of a second medal appears to be strong. Short track speed skater Kathryn Thomson won Britain's first in the form of 500m silver and while, Newberry could not hide his delight, he was quick to admit there was plenty of room left for improvement. ""I really did not expect to get that result with the programme that I did so I'm really pleased,"" he said. ""I need to try and land some jumps in the free on Friday. ""But I prefer that programme and it gives me a bit more room for error so I'm looking forward to it.

""I honestly didn't do as well had hoped to do, but I can't be too upset and I have my fingers crossed for a better performance in the free,"" she said. ""The free programme will be very exciting, I just hope I can make it through without any errors. ""To say I am happy to be here in Brasov is an understatement, it is the experience of a lifetime. I am so excited to be here and my team-mates are fantastic."" Over in the alpine skiing there was also good news for Team GB as Darcie Mead rounded off a strong showing over the week with a 31st-place finish in the slalom. Mead was in action twice during the week in Brasov, first on Monday in the giant slalom where she secured an impressive 28th-place finish. And the 16-year-old followed that up on Wednesday with a massive improvement in the slalom, her least-preferred discipline, from her bib number of 56. ""This week has definitely given me more confidence in myself and in my ability, I was quite nervous coming into the competition,"" she said. ""The slalom went OK, it went better than I expected it to. I started quite far back in 56th, my aim was to jump up ten bibs, and I finished 31st so that is a big improvement.

271,"﻿After spending four years crafting a reputation as one of the NBA’s best teams in November and December, the Boston Celtics have found the last two seasons to be rather unkind when it comes to getting out of the blocks quickly, with early hardship coming to define them in their old age. It started last year when, without a training camp to rely on, coach Doc Rivers’ past-its-prime roster took a 15-17 mark into the All-Star break during the condensed, lockout-shortened season. Boston was essentially left for dead as a result, written off as finally too decrepit to hang with the league’s young, up-and-coming powers — especially at the headlong pace the league had them playing. But then the Celtics shocked virtually everyone in the second half by winning 24 of their final 34 games, becoming just the fourth team in league history to win its division after having a losing record at the break. That Boston team earned the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference as a result and then continued to defy all logic by coming within one win of its third NBA Finals appearance in five seasons. With their 2011-12 volte-face in mind, this season’s Celtics entered Tuesday’s Christmas Day matinee against Brooklyn hopeful for the future despite their 13-13 record and an uncomfortably familiar view from the fringe of the Eastern Conference playoff race with a third of the season in the books. And a 93-76 win over the free-falling Nets helped Boston keep its head above water and maintain its No. 8 seed in the East. But there are still serious questions as to whether another U-turn like last year’s is feasible with this season’s retooled lineup, even with an extra 16 games to make it. And regardless of what you think you saw Tuesday, these Celtics, as currently constructed, don’t have another stunning turnaround in them. “I think we’re getting better,” Rivers said of his club, which, at 14-13, is one win off its 2012 pace heading into Thursday’s game against the LA Clippers. “I think we’re very, very close to becoming a good team, but we’re not yet. Our record tells us we’re not. So until our record tells us we are, we’re not.” There are a number of reasons Rivers won’t say his team is good and fans don’t think Boston is capable of a run like the one it put together last year. Chief among them is the fact that last year’s “bad” start really wasn’t all that bad, while this year’s has been every bit as bad as it looks. Sure, things looked ugly last winter when Celtics GM Danny Ainge publicly considered razing his roster and starting from scratch with his team hovering around .500. But the thing that stood out about Boston’s subsequent recovery after Ainge’s flirtation with an overhaul wasn’t how rapidly the season changed course, but how little Boston actually changed on the floor as it did. Most will point to the Celtics’ stalwart defense as the reason for their success last season. But, statistically, the D that went 15-17 in the first half of the season was virtually identical to the one that dominated the league in March and April, even after Kevin Garnett’s successful, if uncomfortable shift to center and Avery Bradley’s emergence as a reliable on-ball defender starting in place of Ray Allen. Boston held opponents to NBA lows in shooting (41.9 percent) and 3-point shooting (30.8 percent) last season, but it wasn’t the result of a post-All-Star lockdown — the Celtics were second and first in those marks, respectively, before the break, as well. Over its first 32 games, Boston allowed 88.5 points per game on 41.8-percent shooting, and over the final 34, it allowed 90.1 points on 42-percent shooting. Last season's Celtics offense, while unremarkable, was also mostly consistent, too. Though Boston averaged nearly five more points during the second half of the season, its second-half shooting percentage went up only one point from January and February, while the Celtics saw a 2.5-percent decline in 3-point shooting. The only place Boston really showed a marked improvement after the break last year was in the turnover game — but not necessarily by taking better care of the ball. Before the All-Star Game, the Celtics averaged 14.7 turnovers while creating 13.6. In the second half, the Celtics turned the ball over 13.5 times per night while generating 15.7 on defense. In short, last season’s Celtics team was always good, and it just took half a season — and one Ainge threat of a scorched-earth roster transformation — for the wins to line up accordingly. The 15-17 start was a fluke. This season, however, it’s a case of new problems, not bad luck, leading to the same bad results. And this season’s issues — a core that’s another year older and an overhauled roster that’s struggling to gel like the Celtics teams of yore — may be tougher to solve in time to make a run. In a paradigm shift from the Boston teams that have dominated the East since the birth of the Big Three, which is down a member with Allen playing in Miami, these Celtics are making their name on offense, if anywhere, shooting a top-five 46.8 percent from the floor and scoring 97.3 points per game. Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. But Boston also entered Tuesday 18th in the league in opponent shooting percentage, at 45 percent, and 16th in defending the 3, giving up 35.8 percent from behind the arc. Garnett, 36, is continuing to play well, though not quite at the level of last year's playoff run, when he averaged 19.2 points and 10.3 rebounds. Paul Pierce is still the team’s scoring leader, not to mention its emotional leader in the huddle, even at age 35. And Rajon Rondo is still the same enigmatic, temperamental wizard with the basketball that he always was, leading the NBA in assists by a wide margin. But the rest of the roster is still searching for a purpose, and the bench has been a veritable mess. There’s no telling whether there will be another Bradley to step up from the ranks of the reserves this season, though Bradley’s imminent return from shoulder surgery will help, and rookie big man Jared Sullinger (16 points, 6-of-7 shooting) and forward Jeff Green (15 points, 5 of 8) provided a glimmer of hope on Tuesday. If there was anything to be gleaned from last year’s second-half surge, it’s that the Celtics should never be counted out, even when you’re positive that their time in the spotlight has run its course. But whereas last season’s team was able to rebound from a bad start by continuing to do what it was already doing, this season’s needs to make some huge strides, particularly on defense, if it wants to become competitive in the East again — and I’m not as optimistic that it can happen as Rivers is. “I hope so, I do,” Rivers said when asked if this team can rally like last season’s. “But . . . you’ve heard (Heat guard Dwyane) Wade talking about how they’re not there yet, you heard (Thunder forward Kevin) Durant saying that, and I’m thinking, ‘What else do they have to do?’ (Lakers guard) Kobe (Bryant) said that, that they’re not there yet, too. “So there’s a lot of teams saying the same thing. Somebody is going to do what they say and take off, and I’m hoping that it’s us.”",Raw Data
272,"Moran had recently returned from a long hospital stay with colon cancer when she died on Wednesday in her small apartment in Los Angeles, said Jack Neworth, a tennis writer who befriended Moran in her final year. As a 25-year-old seventh seed at Wimbledon in 1949, Moran made jaws drop and flashbulbs pop at the usually staid All-England Club in London when she showed up for her first match minus the knee-length skirt considered proper for women at the time. She lost the match, but her striking fashion statement appeared on magazine covers around the world, the British press dubbing her ''Gorgeous Gussie.'' ''She had no idea what she was getting into,'' Neworth said. ''She definitely liked fashion and was very attractive, but she was very naive and hadn't traveled much.'' Moran was ranked as high as fourth in the United States, would be a doubles finalist at Wimbledon and reach the singles semifinals at the U.S. Open., but would always struggle to be known for more than the skirt and the ''Gorgeous Gussie'' moniker she got from the British press. ''Gussie was the Anna Kournikova of her time,'' tennis great Jack Kramer said in 2002 in the Los Angeles Times. ''Gussie was a beautiful woman with a beautiful body. If Gussie had played in the era of television, no telling what would have happened. Because, besides everything else, Gussie could play.'' She always preferred to spell her nickname ''Gussy,'' but reporters at Wimbledon spelled it ''Gussie'' and that version stuck, at least publicly, for the rest of her life. Gertrude Agusta Moran was born in 1923 to Harry Moran, a sound technician at Universal Studios, and his wife Emma. They lived in a house near the ocean in Santa Monica. Moran began taking tennis lessons at 11, and later played at Santa Monica High and on traveling junior teams with future luminaries like Kramer and Louise Brough. After retiring from tennis, she visited military bases, and was once on a helicopter that crashed in Vietnam. She did various stints on radio and television including a sports talk show for six years in New York. Moran married three times, resulting in an annulment and two divorces, and had no children. She returned to live in her childhood home in Santa Monica, but she could not afford to keep it and lost it in 1986. She spent her last years in a tiny, run-down apartment in Hollywood. Moran could have called on any number of well-off friends in the tennis world for help, but she refused. ''She was quite proud,'' Neworth said. ''But she wasn't bitter.'' Moran always said she wanted red carpet in her house, loving the glamour it invoked. Before she returned from the hospital for the last time, Neworth said, friends pitched in and had one installed. She died a week later. Moran said she was happy that modern-day players like Kournikova, Maria Sharapova and the Williams sisters were flashy and unashamed in their court fashion. ''What's wrong with having a good time with your clothes and your body?'' she said in 2002. ''I was not very comfortable doing so. Maybe it would be different now.'' Moran will be cremated, and friends plan to spread her ashes in the ocean, in view of her family home.",Raw Data
273,"CLEVELAND -- Kyrie Irving's night began with words of high praise from Luol Deng and LeBron James. It ended with Boston coach Doc Rivers singing the blues. Actually, Rivers showed plenty of admiration for Irving, too. And how could Rivers not? He just watched Irving torch the Celtics for 40 points, lifting the Cavaliers to a 95-90 victory at The Q. ""In the fourth quarter, Kyrie Irving happened,"" Rivers said, citing Irving's 11 points in the final 2:32 as a big reason the Cavs were able to pull away. Moments later, Rivers admitted that his not-so-secret ballot for the All-Star game was cast with Irving's name etched on it. Meanwhile, Miami star James and Chicago forward Deng don't get to vote. But they do get to express opinions. James did as much on Twitter, saying Irving deserved a spot on the All-Star team. Then there's Deng, who didn't mention the All-Star game. He just mentioned All-Star skills. ""Man (Irving's) handles is sick,"" Deng wrote. ""The basketball is like a yoyo in his hands."" Of course, what's considerably more important than Irving making the All-Star team is the Cavs' core continuing to develop. Earlier in the day, general manager Chris Grant attempted to do his part by obtaining forward Marreese Speights, shooting guard Wayne Ellington and point guard Josh Selby (and a future first-round pick) from Memphis. The cost? Forward Jon Leuer, who appeared in a measly nine of 41 games. The league actually approved of this basketball version of armed robbery, which can only be good news, because Grant doesn't plan to stop seeing what's out there anytime soon. Anyway, Tristan Thompson did his part, too. Like Irving, Thompson was a top-five pick in the 2011 draft. For a while, he look liked he should've been drafted 217th. But more and more, Thompson is resembling a man who Cavs coach Byron Scott can trust, and not just because Thompson has tons of athleticism and length to block or alter opposing shots. Nowadays, Thompson looks fairly competent on the offensive end as well. Not only does he seem to be playing with more confidence and poise, he's actually developing a real touch. That's kind of nice, because the Cavs will tell you no one puts in more time than Thompson. And guess what? It paid off big against a Celtics frontcourt that features Kevin Garnett and Brandon Bass -- a frontcourt that prides itself on defense and a little intimidation. Yet Thompson hit nine of 18 shots, scored a career-high 21 points and grabbed an important nine rebounds. ""I'm just understanding the game more,"" Thompson explained. ""The more games you play, the more minutes you're on the floor, the more experience you gain."" Some fans never believed Thompson could play this well. Some may not believe he can sustain it. But he's improving and so are the Cavs (11-32), who have looked better the past two weeks than in any other stretch of the season. That may not sound like much, but it's what they've been aiming for all along. They've been aiming for growth. ""Overall, I really thought we hung in there and did the things we needed to do,"" Scott said. ""It's something to build on."" So the Cavs will continue to build on these types of nights, they'll continue to re-purpose the roster, they'll continue to ride Irving and watch Thompson make strides. If they're fortunate, they'll be rewarded by having a representative in the All-Star game. But that sort of respect isn't what they're aiming for in the long run. They would rather make progress today, contend tomorrow, and have fun along the way. Recently, that's been the story with this team.",Raw Data
274,"DALLAS — Fans hoping to see Stars center Jamie Benn back on Saturday night at home against St. Louis won’t be getting their wish. But they should be pretty happy after that — and for the next five years. The 2012 All-Star and restricted free agent, who has been working out in Canada without a contract, on Thursday agreed to a five-year, $26.25 million with the team and is line to make his season debut Monday night at Columbus. ""It's really big. We know how important he is to our hockey club and I think everybody in this building knows how important he is and at the end of the day, it's the right thing,"" Stars general manager Joe Nieuwendyk said. ""It's good for our hockey club. It's great for Jamie. He needs to be back in that locker room with his teammates and tomorrow he will be."" Benn has been working out back home in British Columbia since his stint playing in Germany ended about a month ago. He was en route back to Dallas during Thursday's game with Chicago and the club's GM expects any adjustment back to his teammates to be a short one. ""I don't it's going to take him long. He'll be energized. He's only 23 years old, so once he gets back with his teammates I think it will come quick,"" Nieuwendyk said. Once Benn does return to the pond for Dallas, one would think that he automatically slots back into familiar territory, centering the Stars' second line. That line is currently centered by Cody Eakin, who had two assists in a 2-1 win at Detroit on Tuesday, his first with that unit. Prior to win over the Red Wings, Eakin had been centering Dallas' fourth line while Tom Wandell centered the second line in the first two games before Dallas head coach Glen Gulutzan flipped them — a move that clearly paid off. Nieuwendyk is clearly elated to have Benn back in the fold but like any NHL general manager, he can't help but see the bigger picture associated with Thursday's announcement. ""Well, I'm really proud of the fact that we're improving a core group of players that we think we can build with and win with. And Jamie is obviously one of those players. To have Loui [Eriksson] signed up and Kari [Lehtonen] and [Alex] Goligoski and Trevor Daley, I just think it shows that guys want to be here,"" he said. ""They're committed and we're headed in the right direction. Having a player like Jamie is obviously a big part of that.""",Raw Data

277,"The temperature gauge read 32 as the New York Giants plodded off the field following their 42-7 win over the Philadelphia Eagles Sunday, but the steady winds that whipped through MetLife Stadium had it feeling more like the teens, especially once the sun began to dip below the horizon of the stadium lights, fading like the home team’s playoff hopes. Most of the 80,657 fans who filled the bowl earlier in the afternoon had already left for their cars or for trains home — many doing so after Eli Manning’s career-high fifth touchdown pass of the day with 6:58 left to play. But those who remained until after the final whistle did so shivering and praying, eyes fixed the stadium’s four large video boards showing the end of a Bears-Lions game 600 miles away in Detroit. With a Lions win, the Giants’ playoff hopes would have still been alive, even if the rest of the chain of events necessary to give New York a chance to defend its Super Bowl title seemed unlikely to pan out. So these faithful fans, a few thousand of them, at best, were going to stick around, bundled up, teeth chattering until the bitter end — until they knew, for certain, that another magical playoff run wasn’t happening. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. That moment came just before 4 p.m. ET, when Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler scrambled for 19 yards on third-and-3 with 3:28 left to play, the run rendering an audible sigh from the MetLife crowd. The Giants faithful groaned again when Matt Forte's 13-yard carry took the Bears to the two-minute warning just seconds after Detroit had spent its final timeout. Then most of the fans just stood frozen — by wind or, perhaps, by sadness — as Chicago kneeled out the clock on a 26-24 win that ended the Giants’ season. Once the stunning disappointment had set in, the few supporters still in their seats turned and gathered their things and headed for the exits for the final time this year, while the Giants’ players and coaches did the same in the locker rooms below. And as the parking lots slowly emptied, you couldn’t help but think that everyone leaving the Meadowlands in their rearview mirror was doing the same thing — ruminating on the regrets of a season that ended too soon. “It hurts,” said Manning, who threw for 208 yards, and played a nearly flawless first half as New York cruised to a 35-7 lead in the season finale. “Each year you want to make the playoffs to give yourself an opportunity to win a championship. 9-7 last year was good enough, but it wasn’t good enough this year, and we knew it wasn’t going to be.” It really is hard to believe that this is how the Giants’ season ended, given the way it started for the defending champs. After a 38-10 destruction of the Green Bay Packers improved the Giants to 7-4 the Sunday after Thanksgiving, it was hard to believe that this team could possibly end up watching the playoffs from home. But the month of December proved unkind to New York, and back-to-back road losses to the Falcons and Ravens in Weeks 15 and 16 knocked them out of the driver’s seat with one game left to play. In Week 17, the Giants did their part and turned in their most lopsided blowout of the Eagles in 40 years, but in the end, their destiny was in the hands of too many other teams who didn’t come through. “It goes without saying that the first thing is you don’t ever rely on anybody else in this business,” Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. “You’ve got to take care of your own business, and we certainly had our chances. That’ll be the No. 1 thing that I talk to the team about tomorrow, and I really do want to discuss with some of the players: ‘What in the world was the last two weeks about?’ Quite frankly, I’m anxious to find out if anybody has an opinion or an answer.” It’s easy to explain the season away as having unraveled in Atlanta and Baltimore, as New York needed just one win in those two games to likely clinch a spot. But it’s really much more complicated than that, and the Giants’ inconsistency has been their bane all season long. As impressive as New York looked in blowout wins over San Francisco, Green Bay and New Orleans this year, they also looked equally inept in many of their losses — each of which was puzzling in its own way. In addition to the back-to-back routs down the home stretch, there was the stunning home loss to Pittsburgh in Week 9, during which New York blew a 10-point fourth-quarter lead, and the shameful blowout in Cincinnati the following Sunday, when the Giants offense didn’t even muster a touchdown until it was trailing 31-6 late in the fourth quarter. But the defeats that hurt the most — the ones that really kept New York out of the postseason just one year after winning the Super Bowl following an identical 9-7 season — were the three division losses, one to each of its NFC East comrades, by a combined 10 points. New York had a chance in every one of those games, and single win would have likely given them a division crown and a chance to defend their title. Feed your NFL addiction! Come feast on all the news in our updating blog. “There’s a lot of great football teams in this league, and you’ve got to win the ones you’re supposed to,” defensive end Justin Tuck said. “That’s why the division games mean so much. Obviously if we’d won the division games, we’re still in the driver’s seat. It’s been a funny year.” A humbling home loss to Dallas in Week 1 spoiled the Giants' Super Bowl celebration, and an offensive pass interference penalty was their undoing in Week 4 at Philadelphia, where they lost 19-17. With 15 seconds left in that first Eagles game, Ramses Barden committed an offensive pass interference penalty that made Lawrence Tynes' game-winner a would-be career-long, at 54 yards, and then Tynes missed twice — once wide left, but negated by a timeout, and the other on target but just short. In Week 12 on a Monday night at Washington, New York moved the ball well against the Redskins defense, but couldn’t seem to find the end zone. The result was a 17-16 loss for the Giants, who led 13-10 at the half and 16-10 after three quarters and had come into the game winners of 26 in a row on the road when holding a halftime lead. Each of those division games was expected to go in the Giants’ favor, and there’s a case to be made that all of them could have and should have. Even from the outside of the playoffs looking in, it could be argued that New York had the most physically gifted roster in the division this season. Check out the FOXiest fans from stadiums across the country and tweet us your photo. “You don’t know how many opportunities you’re going to have to be on a team that has the talent to possibly win a championship — the talent to make the playoffs, to give yourself a chance to make it a special season,” Manning said. “We feel like we have that talent here on this team.” But this game is about more than raw skills, and New York is proof positive of that. It’s playing with consistency and making the most of opportunities and never letting up, and the Giants’ season is now over, perhaps too soon, because they failed too often in those facets of the game. “We had it in our grasp; we knew exactly what we had to do,” Coughlin said as he reflected on his team’s collapse. “We weren’t able to get that done, and then we came in and played today like we would have hoped we would have finished the season with. I’m sure that’ll be first and foremost on our minds throughout the entire offseason.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data

280,"Well, it will be interesting to see how Chelsea fans blame Rafa Benitez for this one. What happens next is up to the police as well as the FA but, amid a League Cup exit and the fall-out from Eden Hazard's boot making contact with Charlie Morgan, there is some good news for Chelsea this week. Deloitte have published their rankings of the global turnover of clubs and the European champions sit fifth, with an income of 323m, up from sixth place and 250m a year ago. The victory against Bayern Munich - who remain fourth - helped them leapfrog Arsenal, who still had a bright side to look on as revenue rose 39m to 290m. These figures do not reflect how much was spent to achieve these income levels, however. This is not the only such league table; Forbes produce their version later in the year, which estimates the value of clubs and reflects expenditure, too. It is a source of much irritation (here at least) when the different measures are often conflated by the media under the heading 'rich lists'. The Deloitte Football Money League's value is in charting the extraordinary rise of football income generally, with all the leading clubs' takings rising by a minimum of roughly 30m. Real Madrid cross the 500m mark for the first time, Barcelona are not far behind and Manchester United, despite failing to reach last season's Champions League knock-out stage, are close to 400m, up from 367m. Of course the problem with statistics is how you use them, as well as what you call them; consider the FIFA rankings. Each month you see bare stories that state Spain are top and Germany still second but do not reflect the margins. The world and European champions have a 169-point lead, and Joachim Low's side are 147 points better off than Argentina, who themselves lead Italy by 125. The next 125-point drop covers the rest of the top 10 with something to spare but the headlines would declare someone a 'big riser' or 'big faller' and often the stories themselves omit the points totals. So with the Deloitte chart, beyond erroneous headlines such as 'Real Madrid still world's richest club' on the BBC. Manchester City are up from 12th to seventh, revenues rising to 286m from 170m, but as the full report reveals the sponsorship deal with Etihad Airways, of questionable value to the airline, plays a major part. (To be fair to the BBC, they reflect this, too; but good reporting deserves better headlines.) Chelsea, meanwhile, issued figures in November stating that they made a 1.4m profit in their last financial year, overturning a 67.7m loss. Reporting on the detailed accounts, though, showed one-off items - such as share write-offs and a reduction in payments to sacked managers who got new jobs - without which you are talking about a 19.9m loss. Other one-off items included winning the Champions League. To repeat a detail from above, Manchester United, even in a year where they fail in Europe and do not win a trophy, increase income by 30m. To succeed financially when you are failing elsewhere is a real achievement and it remains unclear what would happen to Chelsea and Manchester City if suddenly they were cut off from the money that gives them success, a question that relates to financial fair play as well as owners' whims. The darker and lighter Blues have rapidly acquired global audiences but no one knows how deeply a fan in the Far East connects to the club compared to one with the physical tie of passing through a turnstile; for all the lists, we are in uncharted territory. Reports such as Deloitte's are hugely informative because of the work that lies behind them but can also be seen as snaphots rather than warts-and-all portraits. Premier League clubs generally will rise against continental peers when the new TV deal kicks in, Deloitte observe - which will make it even more important to look at the individual detail however impressive football's overall financial outlook may appear. Deloitte Money League, revenues in 2011/12: 1. Real Madrid: 513m euros 2. Barcelona: 483m euros 3. Man Utd: 396m euros 4. Bayern Munich: 368m euros 5. Chelsea: 323m euros 6. Arsenal: 290m euros 7.

281,"“Hey, Tiger, the boys want to see you use this,” Bradley said mischievously, pointing to his belly putter. It's his tourney, but Tiger Woods must fight just to contend in World Challenge. It was a good-natured exchange, reflecting the ribbing Bradley’s been getting from his peers since golf’s ruling bodies announced on Wednesday that anchoring a putter — as he does — likely will be outlawed in 2016. But not all the feedback’s been so gentle. “I had a guy yesterday telling me (on Twitter) to send my application in to Burger King for 2016,” said Bradley. As if a 26-year-old who’s won a major and was a Ryder Cup star this year suddenly would be asking if you wanted fries with that order if it wasn’t for his belly putter. Suffice to say, Bradley wasn’t lacking for motivation at the 18-man World Challenge, shooting an opening 3-under-par 69 that left him tied for second, two strokes behind Nick Watney. “It always feels good to play well, but this feels better,” he said. Bradley hit 17 of 18 greens and, ironically, didn’t putt very well, taking 33 strokes on the greens. “I two-putted a couple of times for birdie, only other putts I made were tap-ins,” he said. “Just because you have (a belly putter) doesn’t mean you’re going to make every putt. I think that the public sees it like that, and that’s unfair.” Bradley’s clearly bothered by the implication that by continuing to use an anchored putter — which he plans to do in the immediate future — he’s doing something wrong. “I feel like the USGA has really put an X on our back and really shined a light on us, and I don’t know if that’s exactly fair,” he said. “I just hope that people look at us for the type of players that we are and the accomplishments that we’ve had and not (look negatively) because we use a belly putter. “When we started putting with it, they were legal, and they still are. “It’s a sticky situation, and I hope people can see through that.” Bradley’s feisty by nature, so he’s not taking criticism on the chin, even if it’s been playful taunting by his peers. “I finally had enough of it on the putting green the other day,” he said. “I was putting with Tiger and I grabbed Tiger’s putter and all of a sudden I see everyone start to walk around and start to look. “I took his putter, which is about the opposite of what I putt with; it’s upright, it’s light, it’s a blade, and I made three out of four putts from 10 feet. “So I made sure to remind those guys every time I see them that I made those putts.” Bradley said he switched to the belly putter five years ago because it worked better for him, but noted that he’s still in the middle-of-the-pack in putting statistics on the Tour. He also said he putted well enough to win his first professional event — on a mini-tour — with a conventional putter. “It was just a matter of I just really like the other putter better for me, personally,” he said. “It wasn’t that I was a bad putter or any of that nonsense.” Bradley said he’d use the whole brouhaha as motivation going forward. “Throughout my whole career, I didn’t get really recruited (for college), and no one thought I was any good, and it’s kind of what motivated me,” he said. “I keep trying to tell myself, maybe this is a sign I’m going to switch to a better way of putting.” All that was left to be asked was how Woods — who opened his title defense here with a spotty 2-under par round of 70 — did putting with Bradley’s belly putter? “You don’t want to see Tiger putt with that putter,” he said with a laugh. “If it was up to me, I’d film him and send that to (USGA executive director) Mike Davis. “I think he would take the ban off.”",Raw Data

Lets hope the legendary NBA center gracefully, promptly and humbly rescinds his challenge for physical combat with yours truly. FUSSIN' AND FEUDIN' There's a long history of bad blood in basketball. Like these nasty NBA feuds. Given the propensity of former professional athletes to file for bankruptcy, I would take little pleasure in one of my 20 favorite athletes of all time writing a check his butt cant cash. Normally my reputation in matters such as these precludes professional jocks from selling the kind of wolf tickets Shaq sold on Tuesdays debut episode of my favorite TV show TNTs Inside the NBA. Jason Whitlock, I tell you what: You can come down here and box me any time you want, ONeal bluffed after Johnson read my tweet that pointed out Shaq would lose a Shirt-off rematch to Barkley because Shaq opened another NBA season out of shape. Ill use one hand. You use two. Ill get on my knees. Any time, any place. You dont know who youre talking to, boy. Its my hope that before TNTs next NBA broadcast, Shaq does the proper homework on me. If he does, hell learn the fates of Lawrence Taylor, Andre Rison, Keyshawn Johnson and countless other high-profile foolish jocks who have taken offense at my journalistic work and either threatened violence or personally confronted me. I aint to be trifled with, Shaq. Most athletes know this. Theyve done their due diligence. They recognize that beneath the extra five-to-10 pounds I carry on my otherwise chiseled frame, Im still an elite athlete, the same weapon of mass destruction that made me a dominant force in college football in the 1980s and Mel Kipers sleeper prospect before the 1990 NFL Draft. I hope that Barkley explains all of this to Shaq. Years ago, I had a similar problem with Charles. He was upset with me when I coined the nickname Charles-enio Barkley, a moniker that lampooned Chucks second-banana, Eddie Murphy-Arsenio Hall-like relationship with Michael Jordan. Chuck wanted to beef with me. A mutual friend, Jay Glazer, explained to Chuck that people in the UFC world viewed me as the original and authentic Kimbo Slice, and Barkley quickly made peace. Weve been friends ever since. Look, Im not the type to brag about my physical exploits. But my record in these encounters speaks for itself. Ill knock Shaq to his knees and hell leave the ring on the same stretcher as Keyshawn, Rison and LT. In fact, Shaq would be easier to whip. Throwing hands is not his area of expertise. Weve all seen the infamous video of Barkley bouncing a ball off Shaqs head and then dumping Shaq on his behind. Barkley gave Shaq a free throw, and, not surprisingly, Shaqs left hand missed wildly. I like Shaq. Hes a teddy bear, a gentle giant. Hes an eater not a fighter. UPS AND DOWNS See the NBA's high moments and the low ones. Photos of the week. Kobe ran Shaq out of Los Angeles. It makes no sense for Shaq to challenge a football gladiator such as myself. Again, I hope Shaq comes to his senses and checks my references. As of Thursday morning, 56 percent of independent voters in an LA Times poll predicted I would spank Shaq in a boxing match. Now, the guys at TNT had a little fun with an old, outdated picture of me taking a nap on a couch after a vigorous workout. Because of the camera angle, it appeared I was 10-to-15 pounds out of shape. Trust me, Im as physically fit as most elite-level bodybuilders. Given my superior conditioning and the fact I havent taken my shirt off with the lights on since the mid-1990s, it would be unfair for me to challenge Shaq to a Shirt-off contest. Shaq is clearly out of shape, and theres no reason for me to embarrass him on national TV by revealing my six-pack abs and perfectly sculpted chest and shoulders. Shaq knows this. And thats why he smartly didnt challenge me to a Shirt-off contest. So lets level the playing field. I challenge Shaq to a Shoes-and-Socks-off contest. Ive always been told I have very flattering size-12 feet. Shaqs surgically repaired, size-22 feet would provide quite a contrast. Maybe Rex Ryan and his wife could be celebrity judges. Is Shaq man enough to show his feet on national TV? I am. Any time, any place.",Raw Data
284,"Like old times. The two-time league MVP nailed a one-timer from the left circle on a power play, skated a few feet, bent his left knee and unleashed that familiar downward celebratory fist pump. He then collected the customary row of high-fives as he skated past the Capitals bench. And, naturally, it proved to be the decisive goal in the game, coming with 14:49 remaining in a 3-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres. The Capitals hadn't won - and Ovechkin hadn't scored - since May 9, 2012, during a playoff series against the New York Rangers. ''We finally win,'' Ovechkin said. ''So it's much, much better for us right now. No pressure (on) our shoulders.'' Joel Ward scored his third goal of the season, John Erskine got his first since the 2011 playoffs, and Michal Neuvirth made 22 saves for the Capitals, who had opened with four consecutive losses for the first time since 1993-94. The sluggish start - which included far too many needless penalties and defensive lapses - led players and new coach Adam Oates to openly question the team's work ethic. Not so on Sunday. The Capitals went to the penalty box only twice and didn't allow a power play goal for the first time this season. After the final whistle, the players gathered at center ice and raised their sticks to the fans, a fitting showing of thanks from the last team in the league to get a win. It was also Oates' first as an NHL head coach. ''I was kind of hoping it would be sooner,'' Oates said, ''but I'm glad.'' Ovechkin's goal gave Washington a 3-1 lead. Marcus Foligno put in a rebound with 9:47 remaining to pull the Sabres within one, but Neuvirth and the Capitals survived Buffalo's final push for a tying goal. Ovechkin should have had a second goal in the final minute, but he hit the post of an empty net after the Sabres had pulled Ryan Miller for an extra skater. Nevertheless, Ovechkin looks more comfortable now that he's back on the left wing. He was on the right side for the first time in his career for most of the first three games, an experiment by Oates that's been shelved for now. Tyler Ennis scored in the first period, and Miller made 27 saves for the Sabres, who have lost three straight after opening the season with a pair of wins. Buffalo played without left wing Thomas Vanek, who had been on the ice for all 11 goals in Buffalo's first four games. Vanek sat out with a muscle strain, sustained in the loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday, and was replaced by Nathan Gerbe on the top line with Cody Hodgson and Jason Pominville. ''As a line they didn't get much going on,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ''It looked like maybe a little fatigue in their game. ... A couple of our top guys didn't quite have it.'' NOTES: Sabres 18-year-old rookie C Mikhail Grigorenko was stopped from point-blank range early in the third period and remains without a point through five games. The Sabres will use up a year of his entry-level contract if he plays in one more game, so the team has to decide whether to send him back to the juniors. ''I'm going to look at it again,'' Ruff said. ''I thought overall it was a good showing for him. You'd like to see him finish that play.'' ... The Capitals had led for only 2:32 all season before Erskine's second-period goal. ... The Sabres entered the game as by far the worst faceoff team in the league and got even worse, winning only 20 of 53 draws (38 percent) against the Capitals. ... Washington C Marcus Johansson, who had no points and a team-worst minus-5 plus-minus rating over the first four games, was a healthy scratch for the first time this season.",Raw Data

Hairston, a right-handed hitter, spent last season with the Mets, batting .263 with an .803 OPS, 20 homers and 57 RBI in 398 plate appearances. He is particularly effective against left-handed pitchers, with an .825 OPS against them in his nine-year career. Schierholtz, meanwhile, is a left-handed hitter with an .811 OPS against right-handed pitching over the past two seasons.",Raw Data
286,Defending WNBA scoring leader Angel McCoughtry has re-signed with the Atlanta Dream. McCoughtry averaged 21.4 points per game and also led the league with 2.5 steals per game last season. She has played with Atlanta in each of her four seasons and also was a member of the 2012 U.S. Olympic gold medal team. Terms for the multiyear deal were not announced Thursday. McCoughtry was suspended for undisclosed violations of team rules last season as the Dream found turmoil after appearing in back-to-back WNBA finals in 2010-11. Coach and general manager Marynell Meadors was replaced with Fred Williams. McCoughtry was rookie of the year in 2009. Her career average of 19.0 points per game is fifth-best in league history.,Raw Data
287,"Juventus failed to take full advantage of second-place Lazio's stumble against Chievo earlier in the day as they were held to a 1-1 draw by struggling Genoa on Saturday. Fabio Quagliarella put Juve in front in the 54th minute and they appeared comfortable with their lead, until Marco Borriello equalized in the 68th minute. Juve threw everything forward in search of a winner and had two penalty appeals turned down as tempers flared at the end. With finding the net in mind, reports claimed former France striker Nicolas Anelka was on the brink of signing for the Turin club. The only person keeping his cool was Genoa coach Davide Ballardini, who celebrated his return to the Genoa bench with a point which halt a run of two consecutive defeats. There were only a matter of inches separating Juventus from taking the lead three twice in the first half, and then again just after the interval. Claudio Marchisio was first to go close in the 22nd minute, but he shot wide at full stretch, unable to get the right direction on his shot. A minute before half time, there was a repeat when Quagliarella could not find the target as he lacked an inch to make a more telling touch to the ball. And in the 51st minute, Martin Caceres was the same distance away from getting enough of a touch on the ball in front of Sebastien Frey, who was able to push the ball away. The home team finally gained the lead in the 54th minute. A goal was in the air and Stephan Lichtsteiner provided the ball which Quagliarella shot towards goal, and Andreas Granqvist could only help it on its way in. Juve failed to build on their lead, though, and they were punished in the 68th minute when their former striker Borriello reached Juraj Kucka's cross at the far post to head Genoa level with their first attempt on goal of the match. Genoa were reduced to 10 men five minutes later when Antonio Floro Flores limped off the field with an injury, but all three substitutions had already been made. There was nothing else the Rossoblu could do but get all 10 men behind the ball and try to defend the remaining 15 minutes. The Bianconeri threw everything they could at them, and they had a strong appeal for a penalty waved away when Mirko Vucinic had his shirt tugged inside the penalty area. Sebastian Giovinco curled a free-kick against the left-hand post, but Juve simply could not find a way through. With 20 seconds of the game remaining, Juve had another penalty appeal turned down by the referee when Granqvist handled involuntarily in the area, prompting furious scenes with Juve coach Antonio Conte racing on to the field to confront the referee at the final whistle, but Genoa had the point they were looking for.",Raw Data
288,"He persevered through it all, even after not receiving a formal interview for the job. But his appreciation for the position he was already in, and his respect for the organization overall, was rewarded on Thursday. That's when Petke, 36, had the interim label removed, and officially became coach. ''If they decided to go with someone else, I never would have had a problem,'' Petke said. ''But I believed that I was always more than ready. I'm more than capable. I always put this club ahead of me in everything I do.'' The road was long and not easy for Petke. He was first promoted to interim after Hans Backe's contract was not renewed following the end of New York's season. He then went about his business as the franchise attempted to hire Gary McAllister and Paulo Sousa. Sousa, 42, had been close to filling the position, but he told The Associated Press on Thursday ''we didn't reach a final agreement. This sometimes happens in football and we need to turn a page and focus on the future.'' Sousa, who has managed British clubs Queens Park Rangers, Swansea and Leicester, left his job at Hungarian club Videoton earlier this month citing family reasons after winning three trophies inside two years. Sousa said ''this will be a fantastic opportunity for another manager.'' That will be Petke, who was quickly promoted because the team is already in training in Bradenton, Fla. The MLS season is set to begin March 3. Red Bulls sporting director Andy Roxburgh said Petke is very passionate about the club, and has shown the leadership and organizational qualities to be coach. Petke served as an assistant the last two seasons, after playing for the franchise as a defender for the MetroStars from 1998-2002 and later the Red Bulls from 2008-2010. ''From the minute he took over as the interim coach, Mike has been enthusiastic and organized,'' Roxburgh said. ''Mike is very experienced in the ways of MLS. If we brought in a coach from Europe, that might not be the case. Mike knows the league and he's passionate about this organization and team. All of those things add up to make him the appropriate choice.'' The Red Bulls went 16-9-9 last season, finishing with 57 points in the tough Eastern Conference. Petke has a talented roster, but a tough chore ahead of him, especially considering there is a thought out there that he is a replacement hire. ''I cannot believe in my mind that Red Bull needed to rush something, just because we opened training camp,'' Petke said. ''I think my interview process began when they turned to me and asked me to take the reins in November. I think Andy saw me in action. I'm not the least bit slighted that they might have looked elsewhere before me.'' Roxburgh explained the flirtation with those experienced coaches. ''It was very important to see all options,'' Roxburgh said. ''I had spoken to a number of people about the position. For whatever reason, it didn't work out. But I always thought I would like to have a young and hungry coach, who is adaptable. As we went through the process, we didn't rush anything we did. I did have a deadline that I wanted to have a coach by the time the players came to camp. The players had to know.'' The Red Bulls, who have never won a league title, were eliminated in the first round of last season's playoffs by DC United. ''Everyone is behind Mike, no question,'' Roxburgh said. ''We told the players this morning and they were very supportive. Mike is one of their guys. He's a pro. He's humble and hard working. He has to start somewhere. He brings so many qualities to the job.'' If nothing else, Petke appears ready for the challenge. ''I know the players,'' he said. ''I've been around this team for a while. I'm not going to do anything differently. I'm going to do what's in the best interest of the club.''",Raw Data
289,"Third-ranked UConn knew this was a bad matchup for one of its former players and coaches. Then again, anytime one of Geno Auriemma's former assistants tests the Huskies, it's a predictable outcome. Connecticut always wins. Stefanie Dolson scored 15 points in limited time on Saturday night, and Connecticut's tough, physical defense allowed only nine points in the first half, setting up a 67-31 victory over Cincinnati. UConn (18-1, 5-1 Big East) has won six in a row since a 73-72 loss to Notre Dame on Jan. 5. The Huskies were coming off a 30-point win over No. 4 Duke on Monday, outscoring the Blue Devils 47-19 in the second half to send them to their first loss of the season. They put this one away in the first half, allowing a season-low nine points. ''They're struggling right now, obviously,'' Auriemma said. ''They've had some injuries and they're having trouble scoring points. We're probably not the team you want to play if you're having trouble scoring points.'' Breanna Stewart added 10 points for UConn, which dominated the boards 49-28. The Bearcats (8-11, 0-6) have lost six in a row overall. They've been held to 45 points or fewer in each of last four games, including a 72-33 loss at Louisville. Cincinnati's problem: A few players are hurt and nobody can score besides Dayeesha Hollins, who leads the team with 16.3 points per game. No one else averages more than 7.7 points. Hollins finished with seven points on 2-of-11 shooting. Alyesha Lovett had a team-high nine points. UConn is 8-0 all-time against Cincinnati, winning by 21, 10, 37, 31, 31, 34, 43 and 36 points. Coach Jamelle Elliott, a former UConn player and assistant to Auriemma, fell to 0-4 against her former team. Auriemma has never lost to a former player or coach. They went out to dinner on Saturday night to catch up. They had a friendly and animated exchange at midcourt after the pregame introductions. Then, Elliott watched the Huskies' defense push her team around and take it apart. ''That makes us really unstoppable,'' Dolson said. ''We're one of those teams that our defense sparks our offense. We're able to score points in transition and play the game we like to play.'' The Bearcats enjoyed the opening minute, hitting a pair of jumpers for a 4-0 lead. UConn's physical man-to-man defense didn't allow Hollins to touch the ball - she got only one shot in the first 11 minutes - and quickly took control. After that encouraging first minute, the Bearcats went 1 of 22 from the field with 10 turnovers the rest of the half, scoring only five more points. ''We continue to struggle shooting the basketball,'' Elliott said. ''In the second half, they didn't pressure us as much as they did in the first half, and they played zone, which is what we needed to have guys knock down some open shots.'' The Huskies led 41-9 at halftime, the fewest points UConn has allowed in an opening half this season. Hollins took five shots in the half and missed all of them. Elliott repeatedly yelled, ''Get open!'' and covered her face with both hands after one particularly bad possession. Dolson - at 6-foot-5 the tallest player on the floor - helped the Huskies pull ahead by double-digits. She made a 3-pointer and had 11 of UConn's first 17 points, getting easy baskets inside and hitting her first five shots overall. ''You always look at the other team and what you can do to make it easier to score,'' Dolson said. ''They did a good job getting me the ball inside.'' Connecticut closed the half with a 24-1 run that included points from six players, underscoring the Huskies' depth. It was 58-13 early in the second half before Jasmine Whitfield hit Cincinnati's first 3-pointer of the game after the Bearcats missed their first 10 shots from behind the arc. Dolson played only 25 minutes - a team high - as UConn rested its starters for most of the second half. Elliott was impressed by how UConn's reserves kept up the pressure even when Auriemma eased up. ''They're deeper this year with Breanna Stewart coming off the bench,'' Elliott said. ''I was telling Geno this last night: I think 1-through-10 they're able to maintain that level that those starters play with. The last two or three years, he hasn't had that depth. This year, I think he has that. The players that were playing a lot of minutes last year also have upped their game.''",Raw Data
290,"This past month I have witnessed yet again just how powerful the platform of sports is as I traveled throughout South Africa and Namibia conducting clinics for various ages and using basketball as an avenue to teach valuable life lessons and build communities. In order to more accurately depict my experiences, I am going to break my travels into a 3 part series. The first section will be my time spent with our NBA personnel over in South Africa, followed by my travels throughout Namibia, and lastly with the small NGO that I have worked with back in South Africa near the Swaziland border. Upon landing in Johannesburg, where the NBA Africa office is headquartered, I was quickly brought up to speed on the State of Basketball in Africa especially in regards to South Africa and Namibia. Three things impressed me about how the sport has progressed since my last visit in 2009. First, I was encouraged to hear that the NBA games are now being aired on an ordinary national TV station, making it more accessible to the average population in South Africa. It is a country that joins the rest of the world in their love for football (soccer), add to that an infatuation with rugby and cricket, and basketball naturally takes a back seat in their sports realm. Having games on TV raises the awareness for the game that leads to an increase in participation, which brings me to my second point: the increase in organized leagues, especially for the youth. The growth of any sport has to be done organically and with a huge emphasis on grassroots development. Providing more structured leagues for children to play in at an elementary level will translate to better high school players, more competitive national teams and most importantly a greater pool of the population to become coaches and invest back in the next generation. My final notable observation was the extraordinary increase in the number of young girls now playing basketball! The globalization of womens basketball is quite fascinating to me, and South Africa holds a truly unique chapter in that book. Since the invention by Naismith in 1891, American women went from playing 3-on-3 in bloomers to the universal game, uniform and rules we know today in the WNBA. The South African Basketball Federation, on the other hand, was not even established until 1953, a time when the country was torn apart by Apartheid. During this period, women were encouraged to play in the similar, yet very different sport of netball, and even then it was limited to whites only excluding a majority of the population. Nelson Mandela utilized the platform of sport to unite the country during the 1995 Rugby World Cup and since then opportunities and equality have been on an upward journey. One thing I love about Basketball Without Borders and the NBAs dedication to the grassroots development of the game of basketball is that girls are included in their vision! Our two-hour drive took us outside the metropolitan district of Jo-berg, passed the platinum mines to a beautiful outdoor court where I was greeted by an entire group of young, energetic girls ready to participate in our skills clinic. Historically my time in South Africa has been working with only the boys and maybe a girl or two speckled in, so I could barely believe my eyes when I saw an entire court filled with the Platinum All-Stars of the Royal Bafokeng National, the select girls from the north region!! Like many of the girls attending, Elri Liebenberg, has only been playing basketball for a few months because previously netball was her only option. At 68 she played the goal shooter position her whole life, so shifting over to basketball she already has a naturally good shooting form. Had she been born in the States, she would have been groomed since elementary school, filtered through the AAU system as she grew up, and by now be getting scholarship opportunities from every major university, but instead she was raised playing netball, started playing basketball at the age of 16 where she scored 42 points in her first game, and can still potentially get a scholarship to play but it will be a much longer journey for her to get there. I am not discrediting the kids that I work with back in the United States, but there is just a different energy and enthusiasm that accompanies being given an opportunity that has historically never been afforded to someone before, and the pure passion that these girls displayed captured that ideology! The exciting thing about working with these young girls right now is that they are on the cusp of a learning curve to establish success on the national level at a rate that exists in few places in the world. If you wanted to see a tremendous return on your investment in coaching, spend a little time in Africa. Going from nothing at all to anything, by sheer definition you will see growth at exponential rates! Right now, the country in Africa whose President and Minister of Sport commits to investing in girls basketball will quickly dominate the sport on the continent, I know a lot of young girls who are hoping that will be South Africa!!",Raw Data
291,"There’s always excitement about walking into any of the NBA’s many great arenas where there’s a history, especially if a big part of that history involves the Pistons. We don’t ever go to the Staples Center without stirring some great memories of the 2004 NBA Finals, for one shining example. But there’s also great anticipation for me, anyway, in going to Brooklyn for the first time to play the Nets since they’ve moved from New Jersey and to see what the atmosphere will be like in their new arena, Barclays Centers. I go back to the Brooklyn Dodgers when I was very young and I always felt bad for Brooklynites when the Dodgers went west. They have such an interesting identity. You can ask Vinnie Johnson. As much as they love being from New York, it’s not quite as strongly as they feel about being from Brooklyn – that comes first. So they get a team back and for nostalgic reasons alone, that’s a wonderful thing. And New York gets another team right smack dab in the middle of the greatest market in the world for pro sports and for basketball. It’s going to set up a rivalry that will be much, much more important to our league than the Knicks in Manhattan and the Nets in New Jersey, no disrespect to New Jersey intended, because they had some great teams and the Pistons were involved with some great games over the years. But this will make more impact around the league and around the world. The 2004 playoff series between the Nets and Pistons had historic importance. That group of Pistons – the Goin’ to Work bunch – went on to win an NBA title, but they were in deep trouble in that series. After losing in a great game – a triple-overtime game at The Palace despite the great mid-court triple by Chauncey Billups – they still had to go to New Jersey and win to have a chance to come back and play another game at The Palace. To fall behind in Game 6 like they did and battle back to win it, behind some Rip Hamilton heroics, I thought set the stage for one of the great Pistons teams to show that they could become NBA champions. You don’t get to the Finals and play the Lakers unless you come back and win that series. This was a Nets team that had played in the Finals in both ’02 and ’03 and beat up on the Pistons in the conference finals in ’03. Those Pistons didn’t have Rasheed Wallace yet, of course, but it was still a pretty darn good team. That was a terrific win. It was very, very exciting to be there and be a small part of it as a broadcaster. Another element of the shared history of the Pistons and the Nets, of course, is Lawrence Frank, which shows you what kind of NBA experience he has and that he knows what it takes for a team to be at the elite level. We’re confident that this staff and their vision for the Pistons is what we need. Some of the relocations around the league kind of make you wonder how they’ll work when they are first announced, but when you talk about the Nets and you remember that they won ABA titles in 1974 and ’76 as the New York Nets when they were playing in Long Island and featured Dr. J and were coached by a former TV broadcast partner of mine in Kevin Loughery, you realize they’ve been part of the New York metropolitan landscape forever. It’s just a matter of getting them in exactly the right place. Maybe Long Island wasn’t it and maybe New Jersey wasn’t quite the right place. I believe Brooklyn is exactly the right place and that rivalry between the Nets and Knicks is going to be off the charts over the years. It’s already a great rivalry in year one. It’s going to be another fun night of NBA basketball on Friday when the Pistons make their first trip to Brooklyn. Related Articles: George Blaha True Blue Pistons",Raw Data

293,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Three of the four teams in Sunday's NFL conference championship games have this in common. New England, Baltimore and San Francisco were all in the same spot last season and all fell short of winning a Super Bowl. The 49ers, Patriots and Ravens could be ready to take that next step thanks to some significant changes from 2011. The same goes for the Atlanta Falcons, which were eliminated in the first round of last season's playoffs by the eventual Lombardi Trophy-winning New York Giants. Here's a look at the three biggest improvements each team has made and one area that isn't as good entering Sunday's Ravens-Patriots and 49ers-Falcons matchups. The running game: New England has fielded its most productive attack since Corey Dillon galloped for 1,600-plus yards in 2004. These Patriots have done it with a running back-by-committee approach spearheaded by Stevan Ridley, who rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns during the regular season. He's complemented by Danny Woodhead and Shane Vereen, who scored three touchdowns (two rushing, one receiving) in last Sunday's 41-28 win over Houston. Ridley and Vereen were both inactive when the Patriots averaged 3.1 yards on 31 carries in last season's 23-20 AFC title game win over Baltimore. New England is averaging 4.2 yards a carry this season (including the playoffs). The secondary: A 2013 fourth-round pick was a small price to pay for the midseason acquisition of Aqib Talib from Tampa Bay. Talib immediately became New England's best cornerback and is talented enough to stick with an opponent's best wide receiver. He also has avoided the off-field trouble that made him available via trade. Talib's addition allowed Devin McCourty to shift from cornerback to free safety where he is a better fit. Since making these moves, New England hasn't surrendered as many deep passes and is fielding a far better secondary than last season's patchwork group of defensive backs. Roster health: With the exception of tight end Rob Gronkowski (see below), the Patriots enter Sunday's contest with no starter from the season-opener forced to land on injured reserve. Every player should be available for action Sunday. The 2011 Patriots were relatively healthy but still missing some key players down the stretch like defensive end Andre Carter, who led the team in sacks. Quarterback Tom Brady also was battling a shoulder injury that affected his play. No Gronkowski. He landed on IR after re-breaking his forearm against the Texans. That means the Patriots can't draw the same type of advantageous coverage matchups as last season when Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez were fielded in two tight-end sets. “Gronk” and Hernandez combined to catch 12 passes for 153 yards against Baltimore in last season's AFC title game. San Francisco 49ers Colin Kaepernick: Alex Smith quarterbacked the 49ers into last season's NFC Championship game but he didn't do so in as spectacular a fashion as Kaepernick. Since replacing Smith as San Francisco's starter at midseason, Kaepernick has emerged as one of the NFL's top run/pass threats while orchestrating a potent read-option attack. His 181 rushing yards last Saturday against Green Bay was the highest single-game total in league history for a quarterback. He also added 263 passing yards and two touchdowns to highlight a 45-31 rout. Michael Crabtree: The biggest beneficiary of Kaepernick's emergence is Crabtree. He has 44 catches for 657 yards and six touchdowns in the past six games. Crabtree has carried a wide receiver group that has lost Mario Manningham and Kyle Williams to season-ending knee injuries. Crabtree, though, drew the wrong kind of headlines earlier this week when it was revealed he is being investigated for a sexual assault following last Sunday's game. Crabtree is still expected to play against the Falcons. Continuity: The 2011 49ers had a new head coach (Jim Harbaugh) and no offseason program because of the NFL player lockout, which makes the team's 13-3 regular-season record and playoff showing even more impressive in retrospect. Keeping the first-string units almost entirely intact – 19 of 22 starters from last year's NFC title game remain on the roster – has allowed the 49ers to become an even tighter-knit and more cohesive squad. Who's fired and hired? Check in here for all the NFL head-coaching moves. No home-field advantage: The 49ers were able to host last season's NFC title game when top-seeded Green Bay lost to the New York Giants. San Francisco didn't have the same good fortune this season when the Falcons rallied last Sunday to defeat Seattle. Atlanta's tradition of strong play in the Georgia Dome under head coach Mike Smith could prove a major factor in Sunday's matchup. Kaepernick is 2-2 on the road as a starter compared to 4-0 at home. Baltimore Ravens The Ray Lewis factor: Baltimore knew their star inside linebacker wouldn't play forever. But since announcing his plans to retire at the end of the season, Lewis has provided a source of inspiration that the Ravens have rallied around. The 37-year-old Lewis also is playing better football since his postseason return from a torn triceps suffered in Week Six. He notched 30 tackles in Baltimore's two playoff victories. Jacoby Jones: Signed in May following his release by Houston, Jones has greatly upgraded Baltimore's kickoff returns. He averaged a franchise-record 30.7 yards with two touchdowns on his 38 attempts and also returned a punt for another score. ""He's so unique that it's hard to really know what it's going to be like until we get in the game,"" said Patriots special-teams captain Matthew Slater, whose unit had a poor performance against the Texans. “I don't really think there's a returner in the league with his physical presence because he's such a big guy and the speed that he has.” One way to counter Jones is by not letting him return kicks. New England's Stephen Gostkowski booted five of his six kickoffs for touchbacks in last season's AFC title game. Better kicking: Billy Cundiff never had the chance to redeem himself for missing what would have been the game-tying field goal late in the fourth quarter of last season's AFC title game. Cundiff was beaten out in training camp by Justin Tucker, who enjoyed the second-most prolific season for a rookie kicker (90.9 field-goal percentage) in NFL history. Tucker also has come through in the clutch. His field goals as time expired lifted Baltimore to victories over New England in Week Three and Denver last Saturday. Fatigue: The 2011 Ravens received a first-round bye and hosted a second-round playoff game before heading to New England. Baltimore didn't earn that luxury this season with a 10-6 record. After beating Indianapolis at home, the Ravens played the fourth-longest game in NFL history when defeating Denver in double-overtime. Not only was that contest physically grueling in frigid weather conditions, there will be no rest for the weary against New England. The Patriots ran more offensive plays at a faster pace than any other team in 2012. Atlanta Falcons Impact of new assistant coaches: The offense and defense have shown significant improvement under new coordinators Dirk Koetter and Mike Nolan. The Falcons are now a pass-first team directed by quarterback Matt Ryan, who enjoyed his best season with 32 touchdowns and 4,719 yards. Nolan diversified a defense that had become predictable under predecessor Brian Van Gorder. Offensive line coach Pat Hill also deserves props for upgrading the play of his unit, especially left tackle Sam Baker. Improvement in the secondary: The addition of cornerback Asante Samuel was a godsend. Acquired in the offseason from Philadelphia for only a seventh-round pick, Samuel has excelled as a starter and brought swagger into what was a mild-mannered secondary. Opponents threw 14 touchdown passes against Atlanta during the regular season compared to 25 in 2011. Thomas DeCoud and William Moore are among the NFL's best safety tandems. The blossoming of Julio Jones: Another brilliant personnel move by general manager Thomas Dimitroff was trading up with Cleveland in the 2011 draft to select Jones with the No. 6 overall pick. Jones built upon a solid rookie campaign with 79 receptions for 1,198 yards and 10 touchdowns. The Falcons have caused coverage nightmares all season with Jones, fellow wideout Roddy White (92 catches for 1,351 yards) and tight end Tony Gonzalez (93-930). The running game and run defense: Both weren't as good in 2012 as last season, but neither will be a problem Sunday if the Falcons play as well as they did against Seattle. Atlanta rushed for a season-high 167 yards and kept the Seahawks' ground game in check. The 49ers provide an even stiffer test with the NFL's fourth-ranked rush offense (155.7 yards) and defense (94.2) from the regular season.",Raw Data
294,"I'd love to sit down with the four people who've appointed the new England manager and ask them: ""What are you thinking?"" The whole country - and I mean the whole country - wanted Harry Redknapp. I'm even talking about Arsenal fans who don't normally have anything nice to say about a Tottenham manager. So why have these four people take no notice of the whole country? Apart from Sir Trevor Brooking have the others ever actually played a game of football? I just can't believe the decision they've made. I hope this isn't sounding disrespectful to Roy Hodgson because I'm a big fan of his. He's a lovely bloke, he's a top manager and he's got loads of experience - but he's going to be up against it straight away because everyone wanted someone else. I said on Soccer Saturday three weeks ago that I couldn't see Harry getting the job. It had gone on too long. If he was going to get it he would have got it straight away and I just felt they were waiting for the bandwagon to slow down and then pick someone else. Who do these four blokes care about? Do they care about England and their fans or do they care about themselves? They're not listening to the country - otherwise they'd have given the job to Harry. Paul Merson Quotes of the week But I still couldn't believe it when it came up on Sky Sports News on Sunday evening that they were approaching Hodgson. I thought I was seeing things. Who do these four blokes care about? Do they care about England and their fans or do they care about themselves? They're not listening to the country - otherwise they'd have given the job to Harry. I've played under Harry and I know he would have been perfect for the job. Firstly, he's brilliant with the press and you need to be able to have a laugh with the journalists. If you stand up and walk out of press conferences like Steve McClaren did then you're behind the eight-ball straight away. Secondly he always goes out to win football matches. It's very rare that you see a Redknapp team go anywhere and not have a right go. I played for him at Portsmouth and he always told us to go out and play. Also, all the players want to play for him, so I can't believe the decision they've made. I just don't get it, I really don't. Glutton You can't turn the England job down, but Roy Hodgson must be a glutton for punishment. He took the Liverpool job when the fans didn't want him because they wanted Kenny Dalglish instead. Now he's in the same situation with England and Harry. I don't see too many England fans who want him. So I think he's going to be up against it straight away. Every time he makes a decision, people will be asking if it's what Harry would have done. With Redknapp in charge there would have been no pressure on England at Euro 2012. For the first time in years nobody was talking the team up and nobody was really expecting us to win (although I actually believe we have half a chance). If Harry had got the job it would have been a great opportunity for England. But now there will be so much pressure on them it's ridiculous. If Hodgson doesn't get the results straight away the fans will be straight on his back. If they don't win the first friendly 3-0 or 4-0 there will be uproar! I've met Roy a few times. I've played against his teams on many occasions and just before Christmas I bumped into him in a restaurant and we stood outside and talked for 10 minutes. He's a really nice bloke and a top manager. But I feel really sorry for him because I don't think he's going to be given a chance. Money I hope this isn't about money. We've thrown enough money down the swanny with England managers over the years, especially with Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello. Why shouldn't we spend that sort of money on a top English manager? It seems to be frowned upon if an Englishman earns good money, but when it's a foreigner nobody says a word. Hodgson has been an international manager before, but I don't see how that puts him ahead of Harry. He's been around for a hundred years working with international players. His son has played for England and he's been with top-class players all his career. I feel absolutely gutted for Harry. When any Englishman starts a career in coaching his dream is to manager the England football team and Harry is English through and through. I'm gutted when I play Championship Manager and I don't get offered the England job, so I can't imagine how he must be feeling. Seriously though, I'm devastated for him - and I feel sorry for Hodgson too as he's in a no-win situation. I hope he does well. I want England to win tournaments - and I'm sure Harry Redknapp does too - but he's going to be up against it right from the very start.",Raw Data
295,"LONDON: Carlos Tevez steered Manchester City into the FA Cup semi-finals with a hat-trick in a leisurely 5-0 win at home to second-tier Barnsley on Saturday. Tevez scored three times and made two goals at the Etihad Stadium as City joined Wigan in the last four. Im very pleased, because after the game, its easy (to beat a lower-ranked team), but before its never easy, said City manager Roberto Mancini. For this reason its important to have good concentration when you play this game, as the other team had nothing to lose. It is important that Tevez continues to score because we need his goals between now and the end of the season, for the league and also for the cup. Afterwards, we dont know what will happen in the summer. He has another years contract and it depends on him. At this moment we can say nothing, our focus should be on the last two months. Wigan shock Everton at home In another quarter-final, Wigan shocked Everton 3-0 at Goodison Park to book a place in the semi-finals for the first time in the clubs history. Roberto Martinezs side are currently threatened with relegation from the Premier League, while Everton are gunning for a top-four finish, but the Latics upset the form-book with a performance as superb as it was unexpected. For us to go to Wembley is a unique, historic moment, said Wigan manager Martinez.",Raw Data
296,"Ben Wallace, Chauncey Billups, Rasheed Wallace and Rip Hamilton all returned to The Palace in uniforms other than Pistons red, white and blue. Tayshaun Prince becomes the last of the 2004 NBA championship core to do so, but his visit – Tuesday as the Pistons regroup following the All-Star break – comes as Pistons fans are still digesting the reality. The return for Prince and Austin Daye was Jose Calderon, whose playmaking has given Lawrence Frank’s offense a jolt. The Pistons are 3-3 since Calderon was cleared to play as visa issues were resolved two weeks ago. Frank says he’s up to speed with what he’s been handed, but that the offense will continue to evolve as new wrinkles designed to take advantage of Calderon’s strengths are added. “You continue to grow – getting him defensively on the same page with what we’re doing and then offensively it’s continue to cater to him,” Frank said. “There are things he does real well we want to be able to take advantage of, so we’ll continue to add those things as we move forward.” Frank sees the trade as a win all the way around. Toronto got the go-to scorer it was seeking in Rudy Gay, Memphis accomplished its financial goals of unloading a major salary to avoid luxury tax consequences without mortally wounding its chances to chase a title, and the Pistons added a playmaker to better balance the roster while giving themselves the opportunity for even greater cap space heading into the off-season. “I think it’s a win for everyone – I really do,” he said. “Ideally, that’s how trades are supposed to be. That’s being a good general manager and understanding the needs of a team. Tay and Austin have been very good fits there, Jose has been a great fit here and Rudy Gay has done a tremendous job in Toronto.” With Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol as centerpieces of the offense, Prince has assumed a role not unlike what he held with the Pistons in the days when Billups, Hamilton and the Wallaces were making routine All-Star appearances. “Tay is used to playing off the ball,” Frank said. “You think about how he basically played for the better part of his career here. Occasionally, they’ll throw him a postup here or there. When he’s in there with (Jerryd) Bayless, he’ll handle the ball a little bit more. Tay will get his stuff out of transition, he’ll get it out of flow, an occasional drop. Austin’s gotten some really good spot-up opportunities off pick-and-roll play.” Prince slid into Memphis’ vacancy at small forward created by the inclusion of Gay in the three-team trade. In six games, the last five as the starter, Memphis is 4-2 with three straight wins while Prince has averaged 10.3 points, 3 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 32 minutes. Daye is averaging 6.5 points in 13 minutes a game as the backup to Prince, who came to the Pistons in the 2002 draft and spent his entire career in Detroit, an increasing rarity in the age of free agency. Ben Wallace was the first to leave among the championship group’s starters, who logged ironman minutes through the middle part of the previous decade. With the Pistons facing a cap crunch, they simply couldn’t match the $60 million, four-year contract Chicago offered Wallace in July 2006. But Big Ben’s Palace return didn’t come until seven months after the departure. Billups, Rasheed Wallace and Hamilton left in 2008, ’09 and ’11, leaving Prince as the last man standing from the group that advanced to six straight Eastern Conference championship runs and nearly repeated as 2005 champions, losing to San Antonio in a seven-game Finals. “It’s great to have Tay and Austin back,” Frank said. “The longevity of his service and the success that he was a part of with the championship and six Eastern Conference championship runs, what he did here, his growth in a leadership role.” The Pistons won’t have time for any sentimental reunions after the game. They’ll head immediately to Charlotte and wind up playing four games in five nights coming out of the All-Star break. The schedule picks up for the home stretch. Just as the Pistons led the NBA in games played for the first two months of the season, they’ll stay busy over the final two months with 28 games in the final 59 days.

297,"Rubio was upset that he sat out the final minutes of the Timberwolves' 91-83 loss Wednesday night. He was especially agitated after he went to check into the game around the 4-minute mark but was called back to the bench when Porter decided to keep J.J. Barea in the game. ''I apologized to him because it came out like I was saying something against him, and I never went against him,'' Rubio said following a morning shootaround ahead of Friday night's game against the Washington Wizards. ''It was something against me, by myself, because I was frustrated with me because I didn't play. It was something that didn't have to be against him or the team.'' Rubio is on a strict limit of 28 minutes per game since returning last month from reconstructive left knee surgery. He had 4 minutes left on his allotment against the Nets, but Barea hit a 3-pointer while Rubio was waiting at the scorer's table. Rubio said once he cooled down he understood Porter's decision. ''I didn't even need the talk because the next day I realized maybe I didn't deserve (to be in the game),'' Rubio said. ''Because J.J. was hitting the shots and he was able to get hot at some point and make a lot of points.'' Porter is running the team while coach Rick Adelman is away tending to his sick wife. ''I don't think it ever was really an issue,'' Porter said. ''He was frustrated like any player would be who wants to be playing the fourth quarter.''",Raw Data
298,"A.J. Perez previously worked at USA Today, AOL and CBSSports.com covering beats ranging from performance-enhancing drugs to the NHL. AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. Lance Armstrong’s eyes watered when Oprah Winfrey brought up his kids in the second part of their interview that aired Friday night. The disgraced cyclist who had his record seven Tour de France titles ripped away for doping offered more apologies. He said he lost $75 million in one day because of the burgeoning scandal. Armstrong, however, again was light on details and, worse, appeared tone-deaf at times, such as when Winfrey asked if he should be allowed to compete again. “This may not be the most popular answer,” Armstrong said. “I think I deserve it.” Those words likely sent the anti-doping community into a fit of laughter. The man who bullied fellow riders and just about anybody else who threatened what the USADA called ”the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen” now thinks he deserves to be allowed to ride and enter triathlons or any other sanctioned event with doping controls. Don’t expect that lifetime ban instituted by USADA to be lifted anytime soon. In fact, Armstrong first needs to come clean about his comeback in 2009-10 and whether he indeed attempted to bribe the USADA. “That just shows the limits of his confession,” David Howman, the World Anti-Doping Agency’s chief operating officer, told FOXSports.com “He hasn’t convinced himself to go that far. It wasn’t convenient for him.” He no longer has Nike's support. See why. Armstrong denied again that he used drugs at any point after 2005. (Coincidentally, any use during his comeback falls within the statute of limitations, and the Department of Justice — which dropped a conspiracy case against Armstrong last February — could have reason to reopen the case.) In USADA’s 1,000-page report that supported sanctions against Armstrong, officials wrote, “Armstrong’s blood parameters establish that the likelihood of Armstrong’s blood values from the 2009 and 2010 Tours de France occurring naturally is less than one in a million.” Maybe the odds that Armstrong will compete again aren’t quite that high, but close. Howman said the unlikely path toward a redemption will require Armstrong going under oath in front of USADA and not only cop to what was in the report, but also give more information that was not contained. “I know there’s been talk that he believes that he can make a deal with USADA, but that’s not going to happen,” Victor Conte, the founder of Bay Area Lab Co-Operative (BALCO) that supplied performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes, told FOXSports.com. “In my opinion, he’s not going to be allowed to take part in a sanctioned event again during his lifetime.” Conte did what, so far, Armstrong hasn’t done: Give the full version of events — including names, which, in Conte’s case, were track star Marion Jones and boxer Shane Mosley among others. “We are only getting the partial truth,” Conte said. Conte — who had his business and house raided before he served four months in prison — related to Armstrong when the cyclist was asked about his family. Armstrong, who had remained stoic for most the interview, began to show emotion when Winfrey inquired about how Armstrong broke that he was a drug cheat to his oldest son, 13. ""'Don't defend me anymore,'” Armstrong said with his eyes watery. “'Don't.'” Armstrong said the burden of lying to his family was the reason he came clean after more than a decade of lying about his PED use. “The biggest hope and intention was the well-being of my children,” Armstrong said. “It really was. The older kids don't need to live with this issue in their lives. That isn't fair. The younger kids, who are 2 or 3, they have no idea. This conversation will live forever. I have to get that right for them."" Armstrong — whose fortune is estimated at more than $100 million — dropped some points when he began talking financials. ""I have lost all future income,” said Armstrong, who saw Nike and all his other major sponsors bail after USADA announced its decision in August. Armstrong said in one day he lost $75 million in future earnings — probably not the best route to take in a country that still is recovering from one of the worst financial downturns in history. “I don’t think he understands the magnitude of what he’s done,” Betsy Andreu, who was bullied after she testified in a 2006 lawsuit against Armstrong, said on CNN Friday night. “I think he’s (trying) to reason this out, and he’s just not being logical. I think he’s being a little delusional.” At least that’s something Armstrong did admit to on Friday. He said he was in therapy and he’s reining in his tyrannical side. ""I have work to do,” Armstrong said. “There is not going to be one tectonic shift."" So, what we’re left with now are half-truths. The redemption tour has so far been underwhelming. It’s likely not nearly over.",Raw Data
299,"Bosch reportedly has worked with closely with many Latin ballplayers in south Florida, most notably Alex Rodriguez. A source familiar with the Miami-area anti-aging centers told The Daily News that Bosch has advised Rodriguez on nutrition, dietary supplements and training — and that the two consulted with at least one other expert about blood-test results. According to the ESPN report, MLB security officials have been investigating the clinics — believed to be linked to the sale of human growth hormone (HGH) and testosterone to players — since last summer. The Bosches had previously come under scrutiny from MLB and the DEA in 2009 for their links to Manny Ramirez, who had been suspended 50 games that season for using a banned substance. But the investigation isn't centered on the Bosches alone. According to sources familiar with the Miami investigation, MLB is concerned about a widespread ring of suppliers of synthetic testosterone, human growth hormone and other drugs to players who have sought to circumvent MLB’s collective drug-testing program through difficult-to-detect performance-enhancing drugs that players administer through patches or creams or gels on their palms or elbows or under their arms. MLB officials declined comment on the reports.",Raw Data

Between the third and fourth quarters of Miami's 110-88 win Friday night over Detroit at AmericanAirlines Arena, a fan who had been selected for a contest on James' website made a halfcourt hook shot to win the money. With the crowd roaring, James stormed the court and tackled the fan with joy. ""Once he made it, it was instinct,"" James said. ""It didn't matter what consequences came with it. Ain't going to be none. I was excited about it. I'm excited for him. Excited for the moment. It was pretty awesome. That's just who I am."" The fan, Michael Drysch, 50, of McHenry, Ill., had been selected randomly out of 30,000 applicants in a contest sponsored by Carmex and featured on LeBronJames.com. When Drysch made the shot, it also meant the lip-balm company that has a deal with James donated $75,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. ""It was great to make the shot and have LeBron coming to say, 'Hi, nice to meet you,'"" Drysch said. ""He said, 'Great shot.'"" Guard Dwyane Wade has won two titles in his 10 years with the Heat. But he's can't remember seeing anything like that before at AmericanAirlines Arena. ""It was like us when we won the Finals,"" said Wade, who won titles in 2006 and 2012. ""I was listening to the play the coaches were drawing up and I heard screaming going on. ""I don't think I've experienced that since I've been here. It was a great moment. That was a tough shot for anybody to make. Professionals, we try them all the time. For him to step up there, not to stretch, loosen up and to hit a hook shot. All net. You get kind of jealous a little bit."" The always-confident James, though, figured it was a shot he could make. ""Oh yeah. I got that,"" James said of his repertoire. ""Give me enough tries, I'll make that."" Well, Drysch, a computer technician, got one try. He drilled it. Drysch, who flew to Miami on Thursday, said he'd been practicing a variety of halfcourt shots in the past week and nothing really worked. After he tried a one-handed attempt, he said the shots at least were close. Drysch said he will use the money for bills and to pay taxes. He was asked if his shot might get him a role in the Heat organization. ""Maybe I'll be an assistant coach or mascot or something,"" he said. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra didn't see the shot. But then he looked up and saw his star player bowling over a guy at halfcourt. ""I just heard the eruption and I turned and saw LeBron absolutely tackle him,"" Spoelstra said. ""I had no idea what was going on. I figured he hit it, but the tackle blew it away. ""I think the fan, while he'll love the (money), I think having that on video, LeBron James tackling you at halfcourt in front of 20,000, I think that will be the longer lasting memory."" Wade agreed. ""I think it was an out-out-body experience,"" Wade said of James tackling Drysch. ""I'm sure the tackle from LeBron will rank up there with one of his best moments."" Forget just Drysch. James' tackle figures to rank as one of the most entertaining sports moments for some time.",Raw Data
301,"SPANISH starlet Isco has sparked a scramble for his signature by admitting he would be happy to leave current club Malaga. The 20-year-old signed a new contract with the cash-strapped La Liga side last month. But the move was merely seen as a bid by Malaga to extract more money for their prize asset this summer. Isco's new deal contains a £30m release clause, with the club's Qatari owners hoping a bidding war for the attacking midfielder will break out at the end of the season. Malaga have been banned from European competition next term, after their financial difficulties left them unable to pay wages at one point last year. And Isco knows that his side's perilous book-keeping could mean he is sold in the near future. In an interview with Spanish newspaper AS, Isco revealed he would have no problem leaving Malaga, if a deal was in their best interest. ""If it's helping Malaga, I would have no problem in accepting an outcome that was good for both,"" he said.

302,"The team announced a five-year, $300 million plan to rebuild the Friendly Confines at the annual Cubs Convention on Saturday, and owner Tom Ricketts said his family is willing to foot the entire bill — but only if some long-standing restrictions are lifted. “[We would] like to be treated like the other 29 clubs,” Cubs president of business operations Crane Kenney said. “If [the Ricketts] are going to be able to build their business, put signs where they need them, hold games when they need them, they’re prepared to write the entire check themselves.” That doesn’t mean the Cubs wouldn’t accept some help from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. “If we’re a public enterprise that’s going to be restricted like a public asset, and it comes time for renovation, we’d like to be supported,” Kenney said, adding that the mayor has been “terrific” throughout their conversations. A call to the mayor’s office for comment was not immediately returned. Every baseball venue has its own charms. See the highlights of each major league ballpark. Due to its location in the middle of a residential neighborhood, the Cubs are limited to a maximum of 30 home night games per season and can’t play night games on Friday or Saturday. They’re also the only major league team that faces advertising limitations. “We’d just like a little more flexibility to have that stuff,” Ricketts said. “We have an opportunity that is tremendous. Just give us some relief on some of these restrictions and then we’ll take care of Wrigley Field.” Taxpayer burden and job creation are two other points of contention when it comes to the project. Ricketts tried to put them both to bed on Saturday. The remodeling, which the team hopes will start at the end of the 2013 season, would create about 2,100 jobs over five years, according to team projections. Ricketts, who bought the team in 2009, said the team has been looking beyond the taxpayers for help. “We’re not looking at amusement taxes,” he said. “We’re trying to think of other things that might help us finance the renovations and move forward.” Come for the game, stay for the party. Find out everything you need to know to enjoy the grand old game. The stadium overhaul includes a large increase in restrooms and an expanded concourse. More than 50 million pounds of concrete and steel will be removed. All of the historical aspects of the field will be retained, including the ivy, center field scoreboard and the iconic Chicago Cubs marquee. “The elements that really define Wrigley Field, we would be the last ones who would want to touch those,” Kenney said. Kenney also called the Cubs facilities “the worst in Major League Baseball.” General manager Jed Hoyer said the home clubhouse would top the priority list, comparing Wrigley’s facilities to Fenway Park’s when he and Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein were in Boston. “Theo and I both saw how [the renovations] changed the organization, going from an iconic ballpark in a beautiful city, but also in adding first-class facilities,” Hoyer said. Ricketts make it no secret that they have a similar path in mind. Looking for the latest on the Cubs? Get the schedule, scores, standings and more. “We certainly watched what the Red Sox did and there are a lot of lessons we can use,” he said. “We’ve hired a lot of the people they used on their park to do our park.” The Cubs also hope to match Boston’s success on the field under Epstein and Hoyer. The duo is in its second year of a rebuilding project much larger than just a stadium. The Cubs lost 101 games last season, haven’t been to the playoffs since 2008 and haven’t won a World Series since 1908. While the Cubs have a five-year plan for the stadium restoration, their on-field rebuilding is much murkier. “We’re trying to get this organization healthy,” manager Dale Sveum said. “Within a year, believe me, this thing has come a long, long way.” Still, Ricketts, Hoyer and Epstein repeatedly dodged fan questions about specific timelines for success. “It doesn’t happen overnight,” Ricketts said. “You just have to think long-term. We think we have the right time horizon to do it the right way. “I really do believe we have the smartest guys in baseball building us a championship team. It just takes time.”",Raw Data
303,"After years of denials, insults and lawsuits both implying the contrary and flat-out admonishing those who argued otherwise, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has finally admitted what many in and around the sport assumed all along: He used performance-enhancing drugs throughout his illustrious career, including during his unprecedented run of seven consecutive Tour de France championships from 1999 through 2005. The 41-year-old testicular cancer survivor, who became one of the world’s most famous, inspirational and well-paid athletes as he grew to be the face of cycling and his Livestrong Foundation during the early 2000s, confessed to the decade-plus of widespread doping — the confession coming during the first part of a nationally televised interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Thursday night. Part two of the special airs Friday night at 9 ET on OWN. “This story was so perfect for so long,” Armstrong told Winfrey, looking back on his rise to success following his 1996 cancer diagnosis. “You overcome the disease, you win the Tour de France seven times, you have a happy marriage, you have children — it’s just a mythic, perfect story, and it wasn’t true.” Winfrey began Thursday’s portion of the show with a series of no-nonsense, yes-or-no questions, during which Armstrong confirmed he illegally used a number of banned substances, including erythropoietin (EPO), testosterone, cortisone and human growth hormone, and he took part in blood doping and blood transfusions — doing so during each of his seven Tour wins. When asked whether he could have won seven consecutive Tour de France titles without doping, Armstrong said, “Not in my view” — indicating it wasn’t possible because of the rampant use of PEDs during the era in which he won all his titles. For most of the interview, Armstrong defended his actions with claims that doping was an epidemic among cyclists — though he declined multiple times to discuss specific details or any particular riders’ drug use. “I don’t want to accuse anybody else. I don’t want to necessarily talk about anybody else,” Armstrong said. “I made the decisions, those are my mistakes, and I’m sitting here today to acknowledge that.” At one point during the interview, Armstrong told Winfrey it was “scary” that he didn’t feel he was doing anything wrong by doping — which he admitted started in the 1990s, “before the EPO generation.” He said it was “even scarier” that he didn’t feel bad about it, and that the “scariest” aspect of his PED use was that he didn’t feel in any way that he was cheating by using the banned substances. But Armstrong, who wore a blazer, dress shirt and boots, was never particularly contrite, and his outward emotion never really changed throughout the 90-minute special. “I’m not sure this is an acceptable answer, but that’s like saying we have to have air in our tires or we have to have water in our bottles,” Armstrong said. “In my view, (doping) was part of the job. ... I didn’t invent the culture, but I didn’t try to stop the culture, and that’s my mistake. That’s what I have to be sorry for.” When pressed by Winfrey about whether he, as the leader of his US Postal Service-sponsored team, pressured other riders on his team to use PEDs — one of many accusations levied against him as the alleged ringleader of the team’s doping strategy — Armstrong repeatedly denied making any such threats, though he acknowledged to Winfrey on multiple occasions that he could understand how riders could have felt that a threat was implied. “I guess I could have (forced teammates to use PEDs), but I never did,” Armstrong said. “There was a level of expectation. We expected guys to be fit, to be strong, to perform, but I certainly didn’t (make threats). ... Even if I don’t say it, but I do it, and I’m the leader of the team, you’re leading by example, and that’s a problem.” In addition to saying, essentially, that he simply did what everyone else was doing, Armstrong pointed to a number of other motivations for his unabashed PED use. One, he said, was the fighting spirit that motivated him during his battle with cancer, which lasted from October 1996 to February 1997. “That process turned me into a person — it was truly win at all costs,” Armstrong said. “When I was diagnosed, I said, ‘I will do anything I need to do to survive,’ and that’s good. And I took that attitude, that ruthless and relentless and win-at-all-costs attitude into cycling, and that’s bad.” Armstrong, too, blamed the drug use on the pressure to live up to his larger-than-life story. “Behind that story, behind that picture was momentum — whether it was fans or media, it just gets going,” Armstrong said. “And I lost myself in all that. I couldn’t handle it, and I was used to controlling everything in my life. I’ve controlled every outcome in my life.” Armstrong also indicated to Winfrey that, during the height of his success, there was little motivation to stop doping because doping was so easy to get away with during that era — largely because PED testing wasn’t as developed as it is now, and it was only performed at actual races. “Drug testing has changed, it’s evolved,” Armstrong said. “There wasn’t that much out-of-competition testing, so you’re not going to get caught, because you’re clean at the races. … (Then) two things changed … the shift to out-of-competition testing and the biological passport. It really worked.” Armstrong denied ever doping during his return to cycling and the Tour de France —a third-place finish in 2009 and a 23rd-place finish in 2010, his final Tour race — but said that his comeback was what led to his story eventually unraveling. After Armstrong returned to the sport, he faced a federal investigation, which began in 2010. That investigation was dropped in early 2012, and at that point, Armstrong felt he had finally put his past in the past. “It’s hard to define victory, but I thought I was out of the woods,” Armstrong said of the Department of Justice decision, which Winfrey likened to wolves leaving his door. “And those are some serious wolves.” But Armstrong still had to combat incriminating statements —made both publicly and under oath and to the US Anti-Doping Agency — from former teammates and associates, including Tyler Hamilton, Frankie Andreu, George Hincapie and Floyd Landis, among others. During the Winfrey interview, Armstrong referred to Hincapie’s statements regarding Armstrong’s drug use to be what sealed his fate. Hincapie was the only rider who raced on Armstrong’s team during each of his Tour de France wins. “If George didn’t say it, they’d say, ‘Well George didn’t say it, so I’m sticking with Lance,’ ” Armstrong said. “I don’t fault George at all with that, but listen, George is the most credible voice in all of this. He did all seven Tours. … George knows this story better than anybody.” In June 2012, before Hincapie’s statements came to light, the USADA officially charged Armstrong with doping throughout his career. On Aug. 20, 2012, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by Armstrong against the USADA. Three days later, Armstrong dropped his fight against the USADA, and in October, the organization released the details of its investigation, which led to the International Cycling Union's stripping him of his Tour titles. “It’s impossible to say, (but he would have had) much better chances,” Armstrong said when asked if he would have gotten away with it — or at least not been forced to publicly admit his guilt — had he not returned. “But I didn’t. … I just assumed the stories would continue for a long time. This isn’t an issue of new stories or interviews. That’s not why we’re sitting here.” While he made many admissions to Winfrey, Armstrong also denied conspiring with officials of the International Cycling Union to cover up a reported positive test at the 2001 Tour de Suisse with a donation to the Union, and also sidestepped questions about Italian doctor Michele Ferrari, who has been banned for life from cycling and reportedly was the person to educate Armstrong about doping from the beginning. ""There are people in this story that are good people,"" Armstrong said. ""We’ve all made mistakes, and there are people in this story that are not monsters and they're not toxic and they're not evil. And I viewed Michele Ferrari as a good man and a smart man, and I still do."" Armstrong also said he played no role in the Justice Department's dropping the federal case — “That’s very difficult to influence,” he quipped. He also said he’d begun to reach out to those he had wronged — including Frankie Andreu's wife, Betsy, who testified in 2006 that Armstrong used endurance boosting EPO while undergoing cancer treatment in 1996 — plus London Sunday Times reporter David Walsh and former masseuse Emma O'Reilly. Armstrong had already apologized to members of his cancer-fighting Livestrong Foundation, from which he was forced to resign as his case unraveled. The foundation issued a statement late Thursday seemingly distancing itself from Armstrong, the cyclist, but praising his work as an advocate for cancer research. ""Even in the wake of our disappointment,"" it said, ""we also express our gratitude to Lance as a survivor for the drive, devotion and spirit he brought to serving cancer patients and the entire cancer community."" It seems likely that the civil suits will begin to pile up now that Armstrong has admitted his guilt — he’s already facing at least two — and the veracity of Armstrong’s apology tour and his level of genuine concern is certainly up for debate and will be discussed at length in the days, months and years to come. But Armstrong said that now that he has come clean, he’s dedicated to restoring his shattered public image. “These are people that supported me, believed in me, believed me — not just believed in me, but believed what I was saying — and they have every right to feel betrayed, and it’s my fault,” Armstrong said. “I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people for the rest of my life.” As part of his reintegration into the public eye, Armstrong said he’d be interested in pursuing efforts to help clean up the sport of cycling, which has been largely discredited due to the amount of PED use — and much of the credit for that uptick in cheating has been pinned on Armstrong, himself. “I love cycling. I really do, and I say that knowing that I sound like people will see me as somebody that is disrespecting the event, the sport, the color yellow, the jersey, and I did,” Armstrong said. “I disrespected the rules, regardless of what anybody says of the generation. That was my choice. “But if we can — and I stand on no moral platform here, it’s certainly not my place to say, ‘Hey guys, let’s clean up cycling’ — if there was an effort to (clean up cycling), if there was a truth and reconciliation commission — and I can’t call for that; I’ve got no cred — if they have it, and I’m invited, I’ll be the first man at the door.” USADA chief Travis Tygart, who originally pursued the case that would eventually take down Armstrong, indicated that Armstrong's national TV confession was just the beginning of his road back. ""His admission that he doped throughout his career is a small step in the right direction,"" Tygart said in a statement. ""But if he is sincere in his desire to correct his past mistakes, he will testify under oath about the full extent of his doping activities.”",Raw Data
304,"""I don't just want winners. I want champions,"" Jerry Buss said. That sums up the way he lived his life. The Lakers are the NBA's winningest franchise under the guidance of Dr. Buss. He made the NBA finals 16 times, winning 10 titles during his 34 years of ownership. He was an innovator, a guiding light and set a standard of excellence that may never be duplicated again in any sport. He didn't start with a great deal of money, but through hard work and incredible risk, Buss developed a vast sports empire. His genius was perhaps recognizing incredible talent and seizing opportunity before anybody else. Like all legends, from any walk of life, he lived his life on his own terms. He developed the Lakers family and incorporated faithful millions from all over the globe into his Lakers community. The Lakers came to symbolize all that was great about Los Angeles and Hollywood entertainment. Understanding the attraction for stars, he brought Showtime to Los Angeles, the NBA and the rest of the world. As an innovator, he co-founded the Prime Ticket network in 1985, breaking the mold, televising Lakers basketball on basic cable. This is the single greatest innovation driving the value of sports franchises today. He sold the naming rights to the Forum making it the Great Western Forum. They were two innovative ideas, commonplace in sports businesses today, but both unique for their time. By combining entertainment and sports, he made Laker games the place to be in Los Angeles. Basketball became entertainment. Basketball was fun. I remember the old Forum Club within the Fabulous Forum on Avenue of Champions in Inglewood. Buss had the table in the back where he held court before every game. It was a statement and a badge of honor to be invited to his table. Sitting around 20 people total, anybody from President Ronald Reagan to the hottest Hollywood stars and singers would be there on a nightly basis. I was lucky enough to sit there many times and was always amazed at the people and conversation. Buss treated all at his table like his family and led the conversation with brilliant ideas not easily matched. While most owners sat on the floor, Dr. Buss sat in the upper section of the old Forum. True to his humble beginnings, he insisted there was not a bad seat in the house. He wanted to be among his fans and to be able to watch a game with him in his section was always special. Many follow his model today, of high-priced seats around the floor but affordable pricing in the upper area. As an athlete playing against the Lakers, you knew that you were playing against the best. I played against the Lakers many times during the 1980s in the Showtime Era and can honestly say that I won very few of those games. The Lakers had a special, almost unbeatable feeling. It was felt by everybody on the court and in the building, including the opposing players. As a general manager of other teams, the Lakers were always viewed as the gold standard of how to run an NBA franchise. From my hero, Jerry West, to my good friend, Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers operated on a standard of excellence only to be admired by the rest of the league. My father, Dr. Ernie Vandeweghe, had a medical office right down the street from the Forum. He was the Lakers' first team doctor and one of the first sports agents. He represented Lakers Spencer Haywood and Jamaal Wilkes, and advised Lakers Elgin Baylor, West and Gail Goodrich. I remember some of his early negotiations with Buss. He had the utmost respect for Buss as an owner, negotiator and a man. Many times my father would come home after a negotiating session with Dr. Buss full of admiration for his integrity, honesty and intelligence. He would often say that Dr. Buss was one of the most brutally honest but fair people he had ever met. My father's admiration and praise for Dr. Buss knew no bounds. Dr. Buss never forgot his friends. The loyalty that he showed to everyone was legendary. Even while owning one of the most successful sports franchises in the world, he never forgot ex-players who contributed to its success. His lifelong friendship with Magic Johnson and the Lakers stars is well known, but his generosity and loyalty to all Lakers is legendary. That is part of what defines the Lakers and made them one of the NBA's most admired franchises. Even after my father's career as a physician and agent was over, Dr. Buss and his family treated him with utmost respect, something I will be eternally grateful for. Even though I never played for the Lakers, Dr. Buss and his family treated me like their family. Always making sure I had whatever I needed when I came to play the Lakers (except a win, of course), even inviting me to their home on a regular basis. Dr. Buss always took the time to listen and always seemed to have the right answers. As part of the Buss and Laker extended family, I feel honored to have called him a friend and an adviser. God must have needed someone to build a champion up in heaven. He got the right guy.",Raw Data

307,"﻿I love the actual football games, of course, but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit to loving the anticipation, the buildup and ultimate culmination of the NFL Draft just as much. Now that the regular season is over, here's what NFL fans have to look forward to. I’m a sick pup, but I know I’m not alone. The NFL Draft is the sports world’s ultimate reality show. There’s deception, intrigue and surprise. There's joy, heartbreak and utter catastrophe. In the end, some young lives and some NFL teams are forever changed for the better. Others, however, take abrupt changes for the worse. It has all the characters — the players, the agents, the coaches, the GMs, the members of the media, the owners and the fans. It has all the storylines. One storyline is the draft stock of USC quarterback Matt Barkley. I listed Barkley as my top overall pick in the mock draft I did prior to the 2012 NFL season. I don't have him going in the first round of this mock draft. Why? If Barkley was at his best vs. Stanford in a Pac-12 shootout with Andrew Luck 2011, he was less than impressive in 2012. Interceptions, happy feet and several games in which he left a lot to be desired have me concerned about Barkley's ultimate landing spot in April's draft. Though the Senior Bowl really kicked off draft season, the NFL Draft Scouting Combine is the unofficial “start” to my favorite time of the NFL year. It's when a guy like Barkley can shut ""haters"" like me up and solidify his place in the first round. Before we touch down in Indianapolis next week, here’s a pre-Combine mock draft to sink your teeth into. Be sure to follow these 32 players next week in Indy. Disagree with who I’ve got your team taking? Let me know about it. My email is PeterSchrager@gmail.com and I can be reached on Twitter at @Pschrags. 1. Kansas City Chiefs: Luke Joeckel, Offensive Tackle, Texas A&M Andy Reid’s the new Sheriff in town and he’ll likely bring a new quarterback to Kansas City, too. I just don’t see it being a rookie. As you’ll hear a thousand times over the next few months, there’s no Andrew Luck or Robert Griffin III in this 2013 draft class. Joeckel is one of the most promising offensive tackles I’ve seen enter the league in the past five years. Very athletic. Nimble. He was fantastic in Mike Sherman’s scheme and even better in Kliff Klingsbury’s at Texas A&M. This may not inspire the fan base, but it’s a franchise cornerstone. There’s talent in Kansas City. Now, there’s an offensive guru as the head coach, too. They’re a veteran QB away from being relevant. Of all the head coaching hires this offseason, only one defensive mind got a gig. Enter Gus Bradley, the defensive coordinator for a good Seahawks team the past four years under Jim Mora and Pete Carroll, in Jacksonville. The Jaguars defense had a league-low 20 sacks in 2012. Werner’s a 6-4 junior with quickness and strength. His 13 sacks led the ACC in 2012 and he is the current NCAA active leader in sacks with 23.5 — and that’s with another year of eligibility left. If Bradley wants to rebuild the defense from the inside out, Werner’s a great place to start. 3. Oakland Raiders: Jarvis Jones, OLB, Georgia Jones was a star in college at Georgia and may end up being the top player on my draft board come April. With a clean bill of health and considered 100 percent back from injury, he could still end up being the first player taken this year. Reggie McKenzie and Dennis Allen didn’t have a first round pick a season ago. This year, I think they’ll hit a home run with Jones at No. 3. 4. Philadelphia Eagles: Dee Milliner, Cornerback, Alabama Michael Vick will be Chip Kelly’s starting quarterback in 2013. Will Nick Foles be Vick's backup? We’ll see how the Eagles proceed in the coming weeks, but regardless of who’s under center or the understudy to the guy who’s under center — the Eagles need to improve their defensive backfield. Nnamdi Asomugha’s best days are behind him, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie can’t tackle, and the rest of the corners are just “guys.” Milliner isn’t just a “guy,” he’s the next in a long line of great Alabama corners to enter the NFL Draft. He’ll be a good fit in Philly — playing for whomever’s coaching them next season. 5. Detroit Lions: Barkevious Mingo, Linebacker, LSU For all the great defensive talent on the roster in Detroit, the unit still didn’t get the job done in 2012. Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley had big 2012 seasons, but there’s room for another skilled pass rusher. At 6-4, 245 pounds, Mingo — the owner of the best name in college football — can play either the defensive end spot or at outside linebacker. A talented kid who has played in several big games, he could make an immediate impact in Detroit. 6. Cleveland Browns: Tyler Wilson, Quarterback, Arkansas Yes, Cleveland drafted a quarterback in the first round a season ago. And sure, there are plenty of other pressing needs on the roster. But I’m very high on Wilson; I’m not very high on Brandon Weeden. Norv Turner won’t fail with grooming a quarterback and before Bobby Petrino’s motorcycle accident, the sky was the limit for this kid. Wilson is a 6-2, athletic, tough and smart guy who went through the ups and downs of last year in Fayetteville. He’s been through adversity and he’s never complained. He’s the No. 1 quarterback on my big board and I think others will join me after a week in Indianapolis. Cleveland and Wilson, to me, is a perfect match. 7. Arizona Cardinals: EJ Manuel, Quarterback, Florida State Expecting to see Geno Smith here? You’re not alone. By the time we’re done with the Combine, I think EJ Manuel will leap over Smith, as well as Barkley, Tyler Bray and Ryan Nassib on everybody’s big board. Bruce Arians is going to bring a new and innovative offense to Arizona, and though the offensive line needs to be addressed, I think Arians goes with a quarterback and a fresh new start in the desert. Manuel has the height, the athleticism, the experience and the leadership to be a great quarterback in this league. Seeing all the new wrinkles, formations and possibilities he used in Indianapolis and what other coordinators did in Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco this season — I think Manuel is the guy in Arizona. For the Senior Bowl MVP, the sky’s the limit for former Seminole. In a draft considered very light on quarterback talent, don’t be shocked if at least three still go in the first 10 picks. Teams are desperate to find the signal caller of the future. New coach Doug Marrone coached Nassib at Syracuse and there will be a bit of an expectation for him to go the Mike Sherman/Ryan Tannehill route here. Buffalo has needs all over and there’s still some hope Ryan Fitzpatrick transforms back into his September-November 2011 form, but I think they go Geno. There’s a misconception that Smith is a running quarterback. He’s not. He’s a big pocket passer who played in cold weather in his first three years at WVU. 9. New York Jets: Star Lotulelei, DT, Utah The “star” of this draft could be Lotulelei. See what I did there? Jets fans might not do flips over the selection of another defensive player in the first round, but Lotulelei is a steal at No. 9 overall. Compared favorably to Haloti Ngata, the 6-4, 320 pound junior college transfer was a stud at Utah the past two seasons. Married with two daughters, you won’t find him in any New York tabloids. He’s a relentless worker with no ego. That’d be a welcomed addition to the Jets locker room. 10. Tennessee Titans: Ezekiel Ansah, DE, BYU A freakishly athletic defensive end, more than one NFL player personnel man has told me they see some Jason Pierre-Paul in Ansah. He’s raw, young and a naturally gifted athlete. Tennessee’s pass rush and run defense still needs to improve. Desperately. This is a bit of a roll of the dice, but the upside greatly outweighs the risk. Gregg Williams will teach him quickly and have him playing at his full potential, no doubt. 11. San Diego Chargers: Eric Fisher, OT, Central Michigan Fisher is a surprisingly athletic 6-7, 310-pound tackle who can likely play either on the left or the right. The Chargers have a new head coach, a new offense and a new mindset coming into 2013. Giving Philip Rivers a reliable, big body to block for him on either the left or the right side of his offensive line is a wise move. 12. Miami Dolphins: Damontre Moore, DE, Texas A&M A year after drafting Tannehill No. 8 overall, the Dolphins go back to the Texas A&M well with this pick, scooping up Moore, the athletic DE/OLB hybrid out of College Station. He has experience as an OLB in a 3-4 and as a 4-3 defensive end, and has excelled in both spots. Dolphins fans may be clamoring for an offensive weapon here and rightfully so. But I like Moore as a Dolphin if he’s still on the board at 12th overall. 13. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Johnthan Banks, CB, Mississippi State Tampa Bay hit the jackpot with its first three draft picks a season ago, hitting home runs with Mark Barron, Doug Martin and Lavonte David. Banks is the second-best cornerback in this year’s draft. Tampa was stout against the rush this season and awful against the pass. With Ronde Barber now a safety and Aqib Talib playing in New England, there’s not much depth behind him at cornerback in Tampa. Banks is 6-1, 190 pounds and can match up with receivers a bit bigger than him. A solid pick here for the Baby Bucs. 14. Carolina Panthers: Cordarrelle Patterson, WR, Tennessee The top wide receiver on my big board. I’m sending Patterson — the 6-3, 205 pound wideout — to Carolina. Cam Newton and Steve Smith have been a great 1-2 duo for two seasons. It’s time Newton has a big, young wideout with No. 1-receiver potential in Charlotte. A JUCO star at Hutchinson Community College in Kansas, Patterson had a breakout year in 2012 when No. 1 wideout Da’Rick Rogers was unceremoniously dismissed from the team last summer. Patterson’s numbers — 46 catches, five touchdowns — won’t wow you, but his athletic ability will. I hate the term “tremendous upside,” but Patterson has … well, tremendous upside. This one’s a bit of a gamble, but if Charlotte is going to keep Newton for the long-term future, it has to give him some receivers. Here’s a potential true No. 1 for him to grow old with. 15. New Orleans Saints: Dion Jordan, OLB, Oregon The Saints will make the move to a 3-4 defense under Rob Ryan and will quickly try to erase any memories of how the unit performed in 2012. Setting the record for most yards given up in an NFL season, the New Orleans D lacked any pass rushing bite a season ago. I was a big fan of Aldon Smith coming out of college. Jordan reminds me a lot of Smith. I’ve seen him going in the top 10 of some mock drafts. It’s possible. If he slips to 15, New Orleans should pounce. 16. St. Louis Rams: Keenan Allen, WR, California Though the Rams spent an early second-round pick on Appalachian State wideout Brian Quick in 2012 and just signed troubled wideout Titus Young off waivers, I think they’ll go with another wide receiver in 2013. At 6-3 and 210 pounds, Allen has the size to be a reliable go-to No. 1 in the pros. He was a star at Cal despite anemic quarterback play. Sam Bradford has a lot to prove in 2013 and the NFC West is arguably the league’s toughest division. Adding a weapon like Allen will give him the best chance to succeed. 17. Pittsburgh Steelers: Manti Te’o, LB, Notre Dame Will the bizarre Internet dating scam that dominated news for two weeks impact Te’o’s draft stock? Perhaps. Put him on the right team, in the right defense, and in the right locker room and it’ll all be an afterthought once actual football is being played. I can’t imagine a better place for Te'o than Pittsburgh. Larry Foote’s played well in the middle, but the Steelers could use a blue-chip inside linebacker for their aging linebacker corps. Jason Worilds, LaMarr Woodley, and Lawrence Timmons are going to be three-fourths of that unit for years to come. Te’o would be a great final piece to that puzzle. On a worse team in a less structured organization, Te’o could struggle. In Pittsburgh? If he can play, he’ll be just fine. Though you won’t read this many places, I think Tony Romo had his best year as a pro in 2012. He did so playing behind a terrible offensive line. Doug Free hasn’t been the player the Cowboys thought he’d be when they rewarded him with a big contract and Tyron Smith seemed to be called for a false start on every other play from scrimmage this season. Injuries stung, but there needs to be more good, young linemen protecting Romo. Warmack can play guard or center and he can play them in the big leagues right now. Not as sexy as some of Jerry’s usual picks, but a solid one. 19. New York Giants: Shariff Floyd, DT, Florida Floyd has been slated anywhere from the top five to the second round, but I think he’d be a good fit in New York, where he can replace the recently released Chris Canty. He occupies blockers and though listed at 305 pounds, he is likely a bit heavier. He can step up and contribute right away for the Giants in 2013. Marvin Austin can’t seem to stay healthy and though there’s still hope for the former North Carolina star, Floyd could end up being the guy for New York. The Combine will be a telling time. He’s one of those guys whose stock can skyrocket after a good week in Indy. 20. Chicago Bears: Lane Johnson, OT, Oklahoma Jay Cutler has one year left on his current contract. If he’s going to even come close to his full potential as a pro, he needs an offensive line blocking for him. The pass protection wasn’t just laughable this season — it was miserable. Johnson stole the show at the Senior Bowl and is expected to raise even more eyebrows in Indianapolis next week. Marc Trestman’s going to be creative, different and successful in building an offense around Cutler’s talents. It’ll be a waste if the offensive line plays like it did in 2012. Johnson could be a great addition to a line that needs tons of help. 21. Cincinnati Bengals: Alex Okafor, DE, Texas Defensive end Michael Johnson had a big year in 2012, but is set to become a free agent this spring. Okafor would be a great fit in Mike Zimmer’s 4-3 scheme. Though not the name his teammate Jackson Jeffcoat was at Texas, Okafor went from a special teams standout in his freshman year to a defensive force in his last two. Capable of playing DT or DE, he’d be a nice addition to an already dangerous Bengals defensive line. 22. St. Louis Rams (From Washington Redskins): Kyle Long, OT, Oregon Who?! Oh, Chris Long’s brother and Howie Long’s son, that’s who. Kyle Long is raw, having just made the move from baseball to football in the past few years, but the sky is the limit for the next in a legendary football family. Is this too soon for a guy who didn’t dominate in college? Not at all. At 6-6 and 310 pounds, Kyle is considered the most athletic of the family, a claim made by Howie and Chris. St. Louis has the benefit of two first-round picks. I think they go wideout with its first one and roll the dice on the second one. I might be the only person with Long in their first round, but I love the idea of St. Louis adding Chris’s younger brother to the locker room. The highly touted Juco transfer became Georgia’s 3-4 defensive cog in the middle in 2012. Huge, fairly nimble and full of potential, he may work better in a 3-4 than Minnesota’s 4-3. Either scheme works, though. Jenkins can’t play every down, but — think Terrence Cody in Baltimore — when he’s on the field, he can make a difference. 24. Indianapolis Colts: Jesse Williams, DT, Alabama Coach Arians goes to Arizona, but Pep Hamilton — Luck’s former offensive coordinator at Stanford — replaces Arians as the new Indianapolis offensive coordinator. Regardless of who’s running the offense, I think Indy goes defense in the first round this year. The Colts drafted offensive players with 11 of their 12 draft picks a season ago. Now, they go D. A big DT who can man the nose tackle spot in Indy’s 3-4, Williams is a versatile Australian-born big man who anchors college football’s most feared defensive unit. At 6-3, 320 pounds, he’d be a nasty addition to Indy’s defensive line. 25. Seattle Seahawks: Tavon Austin, WR, West Virginia Russell Wilson silenced all of his critics who thought he was too small, didn’t have a big enough arm and wasn’t worthy of a third-round pick. Austin would be an incredible addition to the Seattle offense. With the new free-access receivers getting off the line, dynamic slot guys like Austin become all the more dangerous. He’s a lightning rod. This is Percy Harvin Part II. Sidney Rice, Golden Tate and Austin would make for quite a trio. 26. Green Bay Packers: Alec Ogletree, OLB, Georgia The Packers spent their first six draft picks of 2012 on defensive players and yet, they still have a hole at the outside linebacker position opposite of Clay Matthews. Ogletree’s the real deal and the kind of pass rusher Dom Capers covets. Ogletree can get to the quarterback. A converted safety, he’s played both the inside and outside linebacker positions, too. This may be a bit higher than others have the uber-athletic talent going, but his stock will only improve after the Combine. 27. Houston Texans: Terrance Williams, WR, Baylor What was made glaringly obvious towards the end of Houston’s 2012 season was that the Texans didn’t have a dangerous second threat at receiver. Andre Johnson had a strong season, but the offense won’t take the next step if one of the young guys — Devier Posey, Lestar Jean, someone — doesn’t make the leap next year. Williams, a 6-2 speedster, led the nation in receiving yards despite working with a new quarterback and without Kendall Wright. Good fit, here. 28. Denver Broncos: Eddie Lacy, RB, Alabama Crimson Tide running backs have gone in the first round of the last two NFL Drafts. Add another to the list with Lacy. In 14 games last season, Lacy ran for 1,322 yards and scored 17 touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes and scored two receiving touchdowns. The Broncos offense went limp in the AFC Divisional Round game vs. Baltimore when Knowshon Moreno went down. Lacy is a sturdy back who can deliver every down and punch it in on the goal line. Denver has plenty of running backs on the roster, but none with the future of Lacy. 29. New England Patriots: Matt Elam, S, Florida The Patriots defensive backfield improved greatly over the second half of the season, but still needs more playmakers. Elam was a highlight reel regular in his time with the Gators, but he also has the fundamentals down. NFL safety Abe Elam’s younger brother, Matt is a high-energy, high-impact guy. He’s 5-10, 210 pounds and can play against the run and the pass. Bill Belichick has long been a fan of Florida Gators (see Brandon Spikes, Jermaine Cunningham, Aaron Hernandez). Elam’s another highly coveted Urban Meyer recruit. 30. Atlanta Falcons: Xavier Rhodes, CB, Florida State Rhodes is a 6-1, 220-pound big corner who flirted with leaving school early a year ago. He had a strong 2012. He’s a borderline first-, second-round talent. The Falcons took another flashy cornerback out of FSU a few years back in the first round. His name was Deion Sanders. That’s not a fair comparison. Sorry, Xavier. Free agent Delanie Walker is likely going to end up playing elsewhere in 2013, serving as a No. 1 tight end. The thought of Ertz — Stanford’s top target in 2012 — reuniting with Greg Roman and Jim Harbaugh is a scary one. Listed at 6-6 and 250 pounds, Ertz is big, athletic and has reliable hands. Compared often to Jason Witten, this could be a steal at 31. 32. Baltimore Ravens: Sheldon Richardson, DT, Missouri The Baltimore defense will have to reload this offseason. Cary Williams, Ed Reed, Paul Kruger and Dannell Ellerbe could all be playing elsewhere next season and we know Ray Lewis isn’t coming back. Teams ran all over the Ravens during the regular season, though the team obviously picked it up in the playoffs. Richardson is a 295-pound run stuffer who can get to the quarterback. He had 10 tackles for a loss and was an All-SEC performer in 2012. He’s not going to single-handedly replace any of those potential departures, but he’s a very good piece to the rebuilding puzzle.",Raw Data
308,"But Sunday was a different story. She scored a career-high 17 points, and No. 5 Kentucky pulled away late to top LSU 73-60. ''It was my day, I guess,'' Bishop said. Kentucky head coach Matthew Mitchell agreed with Bishop's assessment of her week at practice but said Sunday was both vindication for a long week and a source for further frustration: If Bishop can play like she did Sunday, Mitchell asked rhetorically, why doesn't she always? ''That is very accurate,'' Mitchell said when asked if Bishop had a rough go of it during practices earlier in the week. ''I don't even know if I can expound on that any more. It just has been a disaster the last few days. Really happy that she played that way. That's how we need her to play.'' Bishop, a 6-3 sophomore who was averaging 3.2 points and 2.9 rebounds before Sunday's game, shot 7 of 10 from the floor in 20 minutes, and she stepped up at several key passages in which LSU threatened the Wildcats' lead. She also had five rebounds. The Lady Tigers traded the lead with Kentucky (19-2, 7-1) several times throughout the first half but could never gain a lead of more than one possession. With 26 seconds until halftime and the game tied at 26, Bishop hit a 3-pointer. After an LSU turnover, Bishop put in a lay-up with 10 seconds to go to give the Wildcats a 31-26 halftime lead. ''I think she gave the team a big spark, especially because in their zone, the middle was open a lot,'' Kentucky guard Jennifer O'Neill said. ''She was able to flash and be a presence there. But then she turned around to shoot, too. I give credit to her that she's a good shooter and a lot of people don't know that. She showed it today.'' The Lady Tigers (12-8, 3-4) closed Kentucky's lead to 49-45 with 8:40 to play, and Bishop scored her first basket of the second half on the next possession. When LSU got within five points in the second half on two occasions, Bishop answered both times with baskets on the next possession. With 53 seconds to play and LSU trailing 66-60, Kentucky's Samarie Walker drew a foul on a defensive rebound attempt. After the whistle, Walker jerked away from the scrum of LSU players and was assessed a technical foul. But Adrienne Webb, who had 18 points and is an 80-percent free-throw shooter this season, missed both technical free throws. The Wildcats, whose 17-game win streak was snapped Thursday against No. 18 South Carolina, scored the last nine points of the game over its final two minutes to pull away late. The 13-point margin of victory was also the Wildcats' largest lead of the game. ''The last two minutes of the game, you could see a level of intensity rise in their ability to push the ball 94 feet,'' LSU coach Nikki Caldwell said. ''You saw players making plays down the stretch. Defensively, we had opportunities, but then we broke down and they were able to pick us apart.'' Bishop broke the wrist on her non-shooting hand on Jan. 6 against Alabama, and she missed two games after that. She is still wearing a brace on her left wrist, but she said part of her breakout performance Sunday was that she's finally starting to get used to playing with the brace and without apprehension. Sunday was her fourth game back from the injury. In the first three games, she totaled two points and eight rebounds in 19 minutes. But Sunday was her day. ''I had a lot of fun, actually,'' Bishop said. ''It was great to come out and produce for my team knowing that I had a rough couple of weeks.''",Raw Data

"" View all comments I asked my colleague at Revista de la Liga and the Spanish football coverage, the statistician and excellent goalkeeper James Wheeler, to put in stats a feeling I've had for few months now. That is that despite what Lionel Messi has done for Barcelona this year, there is a case to be made for Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player of 2012. James has done a brilliant job. Follow him on twitter: @Wheels_1980 The case for Ronaldo Lionel Messi has had a brilliant 2012 for Barcelona and Argentina. Once more endless goals and awards have flowed in the past 12 months. Ronaldo: will he trump Messi as player of the year? Highlights include becoming Barca's leading scorer in March with a hat-trick against Granada, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League tie, a European record 73 goals last season and finally he is only a few goals away from breaking Gerd Muller's record of goals in a calendar year for club and country. So when top Spanish journalist and Sky Sports colleague Guillem Balague asked to me prove that Cristiano Ronaldo and not Lionel Messi is the deserving winner of the 2012 Balon D'Or I thought I had my work cut out. I firstly would like to say the purpose of this article is not to say that Ronaldo is a better player than Messi. As a statistician that is not for me to comment on. I am just trying to prove that in 2012, Cristiano is a more deserving winner that his counterpart at Barcelona. When the sides met in the first La Liga Clasico of the season in October many believed it was a straight shootout for the award and not just an early-season meeting between both heavyweights. Once again they couldn't be split as both of our gladiators scored twice in a thrilling 2-2 draw. So how do I split them? Very difficult... my first argument would be that you cannot judge both players on purely goals. Messi has scored more goals than Ronaldo in 2012. Messi has 72 goals for Barcelona this year while Ronaldo has 57 goals for Los Blancos. Both goal tallies have been outstanding and Messi's total is truly staggering. Barcelona's current style of play is all based around getting the ball to Messi in the final third of the field and letting him work his magic, while although Ronaldo is Real's main attacking weapon, he is forced into playing in different positions along the front to suit the team and against stronger opponents they are set up on the break. When Messi first broke into the Barcelona team in the mid-2000s he played in a front three alongside Samuel Eto'o and Ronaldinho and he was primarily playing second fiddle to these great players. As Frank Rijkaard's team became Pep's, Messi's importance grew and grew and after the departures of first Ronaldinho and then Eto'o he became the number one attacking weapon and took on the role of the 'false 9' position. Ronaldo, while mainly playing on the left of a three behind either Karim Benzema or Gonzalo Higuain, he has also been shifted into the 'number 9' position and also into a position off the front man. This switching of positions is always to help the good of the team when in my opinion Barca under Pep and now Tito Vilanova are all set up to feed Messi and get the best out of him. If you look into possession then Barcelona dominate Real Madrid. In 2012 in La Liga, Barcelona have averaged just over 70% possession in games, while Real average just a shade over 57%. More possession means more touches and Messi leads Ronaldo with the diminutive Argentinean averaging 83 touches per game to Ronaldo's 57. More touches means more chances to impress and thus Ronaldo having 25 touches fewer means he has to make more things happen. Another argument into why Ronaldo should win the Balon D'Or and not Messi is that although both players are great individuals, it is a team game. In terms of trophies, Real have had a much more successful 2012 than Barcelona.Although both clubs were defeated in the Champions League semi-finals, a Ronaldo-inspired Real Madrid lifted their first La Liga title since 2008 while Messi's Barcelona only lifted the Copa Del Rey. Also although of much lesser importance, Los Blancos defeated Barca in the Spanish Super Cup at the start of this season with both players scoring in each leg. Key period There was a key period of just over a week in 2012 which I think justifies why Ronaldo would be a more worthy winner of the award this year. In the middle of April both sides had two legs of a Champions League semi-final with the final El Clasico of the season sandwiched in between. Messi failed to score in all three games which is his joint worst run without a goal in 2012 and bearing in mind these three games were season defining they have to be taken into consideration. Barca were on the wrong end of all three results, seeing their dream of another treble evaporate into thin air. In both legs against Chelsea he was quieter than normal and he missed a 49th-minute penalty in the second leg at the Camp Nou which would probably have seen Barca reach the final in Munich rather than the crafty Cockneys of Chelsea. Ronaldo's Real crashed out of their semi-final on penalties against Bayern and although he missed his penalty in the shootout, he scored twice in normal time including once from the penalty spot to give Real a chance of reaching the final in Bavaria. The Clasico meeting in April decided the La Liga title with Real four points ahead of Barca at kick off and with difficult remaining games they couldn't afford to lose at the home of their great rivals. Real won for the first time in four La Liga visits and with Messi quieter than usual it was left to Ronaldo to decide the fate of the La Liga title with a brilliant winning goal with the sides deadlocked at 1-1. Other arguments for Ronaldo and facts that should be considered include the fact that he has scored more Clasico goals in 2012 than Messi. Ronaldo has scored in all six Clasicos this year (seven goals). This made him the first player from either side to score in six consecutive Clasicos. Messi has scored only a shoddy four goals in six Clasico appearances in 2012. In conclusion, why should Ronaldo be crowned the world's best player this year? Ronaldo is the heartbeat of Real and I believe if you took both Messi and him out of their respective teams, Real would struggle more than Barca. Although Real's squad is stronger than Barca's, in my opinion Messi's fellow 10 starters are more capable of adapting to life without Messi than their counterparts in Madrid are. I think Ronaldo showed on his worth to Los Blancos on Saturday night in the Madrid Derby. In a drab first half a world-class free kick from CR7 effectively gave Real the win over their City rivals and thanks to Ronaldo they are still just about holding onto Barca's coat tails at the top of La Liga. Real should do whatever they can to keep him happy and contracted to them. With whispers of his unhappiness leaking into the Spanish media, Real cannot afford to let him leave. Whoever will be announced as the winner in Zurich on January 7 will be a worthy winner and if Messi does win the award for an unprecedented fourth consecutive time who am I to argue? His performances, goals and stats speak for themselves in 2012. However if you dig a little deeper, you may just think that the boy from Madeira may for this year, be a slightly more deserving winner. Do you agree with the numbers? Should Ronaldo be named the world's best player ahead of Messi? Have your say in the comments box below.",Raw Data
310,"It’s no secret this has been a difficult season for the Pistons on a number of fronts, but it struck me as I was calling the game with Minnesota – a team that’s really struggled ever since they traded away Kevin Garnett – that this is what the NBA is all about: great players on rosters everywhere. You look at that Minnesota team – which I am convinced will win at least 10 more games next season than they’ll wind up winning this year, and is an incredibly fun team to watch – and consider what their point guards did at The Palace. Luke Ridnour played flawlessly and didn’t wind up missing a shot, and then Jonny Flynn – the No. 6 pick in the 2009 draft – came in and did what he does best. He found every open man in the free world. Those two are both very talented. If you put them together, you have Steve Nash – one of the all-time greats. And that got me to thinking further that this is maybe the golden age of point guards. It very well could be the best group of point guards I’ve ever seen. Dick Motta, who used to broadcast with me and I believe will one day be in the Hall of Fame and should be already, said when he came into the league there were five great centers and five great point guards and that’s the way it would stay. Well, we’re still having problems collecting the five great true post men, but we’re starting to blow by that number when it comes to point guards. I think one of them could wind up being John Wall, the tremendous rookie taken No. 1 overall by Washington last summer. He missed the game when the Wizards came to The Palace in November due to a minor injury, but we caught a glimpse of him in the preseason and what they say about him is true. The guy is an absolute blur when he wants to be. When guys are that fast, they can make things happen. The game eventually has to slow down for them. Mentally, sometimes they’ll run right through plays. His turnovers are relatively high, but so are his assists. He’s got to be fun to watch and I’m looking forward to Sunday’s game at The Palace to see John Wall. When I look at the point guards in the league now, I start with three veterans who can still play at or near the top of their games. Steve Nash is one and Chauncey Billups and Jason Kidd are the others. We all know about Chauncey because of everything he did here. He’s just a gamer who keeps his cool. Guys like playing with him because of his even-keeled personality coupled with his competitive fire. When you talk about Steve Nash, you’re talking about an all-time great. Watching him play is a privilege. It’s like going to the symphony. He can get anywhere he wants on the court, he can get anybody a shot anytime they want and he gets himself shots and knocks them down. He’s really one of a kind and I believe we’ll never see another one quite like him. Jason Kidd is also a unique player. He’s in the top handful who’ve ever played for producing triple-doubles, a superstar stat. He’s a hard-working player who has size and skill and speed and toughness, but he’s always been a bright guy who finds a way to help his team win. He’s on his way to the Hall of Fame, as well. Then we go to the young veteran point guards, topped by Chris Paul and Deron Williams. You can never be sure – that’s why they call them careers and not just years – but in both cases, I believe we’re looking at two more Hall of Fame talents. Chris Paul reminds you on many nights of Isiah Thomas. He can do whatever is necessary and is so quick with the ball and so quick taking it from you. And Deron Williams is his own man. Like so many of these point guards, he is a handler, a scorer, a shooting, a distributor and he has excellent size and strength. He’s the kind of guy who makes more shots with the game on the line than he does in the first quarter. That’s what makes him special. Then, finally, you turn the page to the young guys. I think we’ll be talking about John Wall with that group as soon as next season, but for now I think about Rajon Rondo and Derrick Rose. If I were going to vote today, I would vote Derrick Rose for MVP. When you’re talking about the MVP of the greatest league in the world, you’re a great, great player who makes his team better. Chicago might be a darkhorse to a certain degree, but I think the Bulls have a legitimate chance in the postseason and Rose is the reason. We could see flashes in his rookie year when he got to the basket whenever he wanted. Now his jump shot is better and so is his decision-making, but his competitive fire is just compelling. He has great toughness, as all winners do. It’s a joy to watch him play and we get to watch him at The Palace next month on Dennis Rodman Night. The Pistons also will see Rajon Rondo again in Boston next month and the Celtics, even after the trade of Kendrick Perkins, in my opinion are the favorites to win it all again this year. That team includes three first-ballot Hall of Famers in Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, but they might all tell you – and I think a lot of coaches would agree – that Rajon Rondo is their MVP. Before it’s all said and done, he probably will have another NBA title and many All-Star appearances and any number of All-Defensive team honors bestowed upon him. On any given night, any one of these guys might be the best point guard in the world. In another time, any one of them might have been the best point guard in the world every night. There’s just so many of them right now that it’s hard for any one of them to consistently dominate the rest.",Raw Data
311,"ARLINGTON The same thing is only kind of on the line for the Cowboys and Redskins when they meet in Landover, Maryland for what basically amounts to The NFC East Championship game Sunday. Yes, thanks to the strange world of NFL tiebreakers and the Giants getting their butts whipped in Baltimore, the Boys-Skins winner wins the division and the accompanying playoff berth. It is not right, however, to say they are playing for the same thing. Because if the Redskins lose, it will be a sad day but they will get up and think Damn, but we are on the right track. We got this amazing quarterback who is going into his second year, his second freaking year. Things are only going to get better."" If the Cowboys lose, what they say will sound something like ""Oh bleep. What the bleepity bleep now?"" The Cowboys are not young, nor is this their first rodeo with being close. They are the kings of close. Hell, on Sunday, they had engineered this amazing comeback and forced overtime after being down two touchdowns late to New Orleans. They lost 34-31 in OT, and they did so despite forcing a fumble and not getting the turnover. A year ago, they went to The Meadowlands for Week 17 with the same conditions: Win and in. They lost and then watched as the Giants launched that into another Super Bowl victory. This is how Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and I ended up talking about patience after Sunday's loss. I asked if it was hard to be patient when the Redskins were finding a way to win with a rookie quarterback. It was the wrong question. The real question is if he's losing patience period. ""Well now that's a different question,"" Jerry said and then went on to admit that yes, yes he is finding it hard to be patient. ""It is hard watching these games unfold and what we're doing and especially the way we are doing it we are doing it early in the ballgames the way we are playing,"" he said. ""When you know and figure what is at stake, a fumble those kinds of things, it is a little bit of agony."" Nor does he buy into this theory, espoused by many including myself, that this season has an asterisk, an asterisk penciled in by injuries to guys like Sean Lee and DeMarcus Ware and so many randoms that have been shuffled in and out. ""We got what everybody wants and that is our corners are healthy and our pressure players are healthy,"" Jones said. ""I'm not minimizing the injuries. I guess I am minimizing the injuries."" In other words, the owner of the Cowboys said shut up and play. He expects his defense to do better against Robert Griffin III and his offense had better do better than what we saw early against New Orleans. He believes his team has a chance, and a chance to go on a run once in the playoffs. ""Just because I thought it was so doesn't make it so,"" Jerry joked. He thought when the Cowboys won the toss in overtime they were scoring, and that did not happen. That New Orleans scored points against this Cowboys defense is hardly surprising. That the Cowboys offense struggled against this Saints secondary was, especially after Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo strung together this amazing comeback that included going 64 yards in 74 seconds and tossing a 20-yard touchdown to Miles Austin on fourth down. ""There were a lot of good things that happened in the ball game. Certainly, the resolve the fight, and determination and will was displayed by our football team again. Those are real positive things,"" Garrett said. There is legitimacy to the resiliency defense of the Cowboys. They have not quit under unbelievably trying circumstancesthe death of a teammate, another charged in that death, injuries and a season that looked to be doomed after a loss to Washington on Thanksgiving. That they did not quit is a testament to Garrett and players who showed resilience not usually seen in this Cowboys locker room since The Jimster left. In most years, this might be enough. Not this year, not in Dallas. The Giants have Super Bowls to cushion their fall. The Redskins, by all indications, are a team on the rise, a team that will have to be dealt with for years to come no matter what happens Sunday. The Cowboys are in the murky middle having not won and not just starting out on this journey. They were the ones who told us before the year that their window was closing. They were not lying. This is where the impatience comes from, from an owner who believes he has the right players, the right GM, the right coach in place. I have covered Jerry Jones for long enough that I speak Jerry fluently now. After last Sunday's victory against Pittsburgh, he answered almost every question with an answer praising his coach Jason Garrett. Q: Where does this resiliency come from? A: Jason Garrett. Q: What color is the sky? A: Jason Garrett. This translates loosely to: He's back. No matter what happens, he is back. And this is what is on the line for the Cowboys, a win validating this belief that progress is being made and a loss testing exactly how much more patience Jerry has.",Raw Data
312,"Editor’s note: Today marks the first installment of George Blaha’s blog. As the voice of the Pistons for 31 years, George is a walking encyclopedia of NBA basketball. Every Wednesday throughout the season, he’ll share his thoughts on the history of the NBA, the state of today’s game and the fate of the Pistons with pistons.com editor Keith Langlois. Wednesday, December 6, 2006 I read last week on pistons.com that Joe Dumars said he considered Utah and Dallas the two toughest buildings in the NBA right now. I wouldn’t disagree with Joe D. I would add that The Palace, on most nights for big games, is the toughest place for opposing teams to play. We don’t often look at it that way, but I’ve heard more than one basketball person remark about the difficulty of playing at The Palace when it’s a big game and the fans are juiced. But those two Western Conference stops, Dallas and Utah, are obviously very, very difficult. The Pistons won’t have an easy time of it Thursday night in Dallas against a very hot Mavericks team. It’s a great team and that’s become a very noisy building. Utah, the fans are right on you. They’re a small-market team, which means they have an us-against-the-world attitude, and they have – year in and year out – a great coach. The guy in the first chair there never changes. It’s always Jerry Sloan, and that alone makes it very difficult. And you don’t ever want to forget Sacramento. They also are an us-against-the-world community, at least in terms of pro sports, and because the fans are even more on top of you than in Utah. But in my opinion, there are no buildings in the league today that are as tough as the old ones. It’s not even close. I could be politically correct, but that’s the truth. The toughest place to play, bar none, was Boston Garden in the ’80s, when the Celtics were great, the floorboards were crooked and only the guys in green knew where the dead spots were, where the fans were cocky and mouthy and where the Celtics, who didn’t need much confidence-building, felt even more confident in their play. You had to play through all of that, not to mention a mountain of noise. Through the years, the Pistons had to take on the mind-set that they were good enough to beat those guys even in Boston Garden, where the ball always seemed to bounce the Celtics’ way, when you’re playing in a building where Red Auerbach still lights his cigar, even though he’s not coaching, and you are the new kid on the block. As concerned as I’m sure the Celtics were, deep down inside, about this terrific young Pistons team, the Pistons first of all had to gain the kind of maturity and poise and cocksuredness it took to beat a great team in a very difficult building. I would say right behind Boston was Chicago Stadium. The two things that made Boston more difficult were the legacy and the players. Their fans expected to win and so did the players. Chicago had Michael at the top of his game and other guys trying to become great complementary players that they finally did become. But in terms of noise and absolute venom, nothing topped Chicago. Those people hated the Pistons. I always wondered if they actually had a life beyond their hatred for Bill Laimbeer and Isiah Thomas. The noise there was beyond what human ears are supposed to be able to tolerate. When they had a halftime skit consisting solely of a guy with a chainsaw slicing up a cardboard cutout of Bill Laimbeer, I knew that these were some depraved people. If you were doing a broadcast there, you could speak to your broadcast partner or to your director in the truck, but if you had to take your headset off to talk to your statistician, it was impossible for him to hear you even though you were sitting right next to him. You wonder how anybody could hear Chuck Daly shut out play calls or Mike Abdenour giving them the warning that the shot clock was running out. The place would shake so, you wondered if it was falling apart somewhere. Give those fans credit – if there was ever a building that they almost blew the roof off of, that was it.",Raw Data
313,"Jamie Trecker is the senior editor for FOXSoccer.com. A working journalist for 25 years, he covers the Champions League, European soccer and the world game. Follow him on Twitter. The beautiful game’s unpredictability was on full display at Estadio Azteca. If you were at the game — whether a gleeful American or one of the many, many nonplussed Mexicans — you’d agree. For the first time in 25 attempts (a streak dating back 75 years), the United States came into the fabled Mexico City stadium and accomplished something it had never done before: beat arch-nemesis Mexico. The 1-0 victory was hardly a pretty game. For long stretches, the Americans were outplayed in virtually every way imaginable; compressed into their own half, reliant on their goalkeeper to save balls off the line and a backheel shot from a young substitute striker. This was not a slick American performance nor was it a sub-par Mexican effort. Wednesday’s performance was simply historic. Andres Guardado, easily the best player on the field for Mexico, summed up his side’s take on the game. “We dominated the game. They got a lucky goal,” said the young Valencia midfielder. “It hurts whenever you lose at the Azteca, and we are hurt.” These are things that a gracious Jurgen Klinsmann conceded after the game. But the United States manager was also adamant that his team had accomplished something very special and had learned to believe in itself. “We know Tim Howard kept us in the game,” Klinsmann said. “We know Mexico created far more chances. But I think if you asked the Mexico players they would say this USA is a very hard team to beat.” “We took a risk,” Klinsmann added. “We started a whole new backline. We told our players you have nothing to lose, give it all you have. Can we play better? Yes. Can we play a cleaner game? Yes. But this is a very important win now for our belief.” Belief was the theme the players came back to again and again as they made the gauntlet down press row and into their bus. Geoff Cameron talked about team unity. Tim Howard talked about how the team controlled its fear and made history. And Landon Donovan, while noting that the win wasn’t as meaningful as a World Cup qualifier victory, gave credit to Klinsmann on the night. Before the game, Howard had spoken about the chance this team had to make history. The mood around the camp was light and quietly optimistic. As the minutes ticked by and Mexico’s shots — from Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez and Pablo Barrera and Elias Hernandez, and everyone else — weren’t going in, belief started to grow. With an hour passed by, some noticed that it was still 0-0 —the same score line signifying the USA’s best result ever at the Azteca. Why couldn’t they hold on and do it again? Suddenly, a player who Klinsmann had intimated had gotten a swollen head made something happen. Brek Shea, the much-maligned FC Dallas midfielder, picked up and crossed over a clever ball to Terrence Boyd who heeled it to eventual scorer Michael Orozco Fiscal. “I never thought I’d score a goal at the Azteca,” said Orozco. “It means a lot to me, with my parents being from Mexico and playing for the USA, this is so much honor and strength.” Fact is, before the game, few thought the Americans would score a goal, much less win. That includes most of the US team. With the likes of Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore in Europe, this was a game to blood some youngsters to the US roster. These were callow, untested and unfamiliar players; in essence, a B-team, group of hopefuls that might form the nucleus of a World Cup side. On the evidence, they are clearly not there yet. Fabian Johnson had a standout game, but Edgar Castillo was exploited all night long. Geoff Cameron was very solid but Maurice Edu, deputizing at center back, probably isn’t a long-term solution. The Americans were shredded in midfield, and until Boyd came on, Herculez Gomez was left alone, helpless. And yet, soccer is a funny game. Even when beaten all over the field, the USA grabbed on to one great run, one great flick, and one goal. And just like that, the Americans made history.",Raw Data
314,"They've overcome preseason forecasts that they would finish fifth in the Southeastern Conference, the transition to new coach Holly Warlick and their season-opening loss to Chattanooga that dropped is them to No. 24 in the Top 25 - the program's lowest ranking since 1985. The Lady Vols (16-3) have climbed to ninth, are riding a nine-game winning streak and sit alone atop the SEC standings heading into Monday's showdown against No. 2 Notre Dame. ''Every year this team should be motivated to get to a Final Four,'' said guard/forward Taber Spani, one of only two seniors on the roster. ''I think this team especially is because we understand really that outside this circle and our families, nobody else in the country really believes in us. That's fine with us. We don't mind that. But I think it provides a little extra motivation.'' The fast start has shown that the Lady Vols should be OK without Summitt on the sideline during games. She has been diagnosed with early-onset dementia, Alzheimer's type, and stepped down last April after winning eight national titles in 38 seasons. She still routinely attends practices and sits in the stands during home games in her role as head coach emeritus. What Tennessee hasn't been able to do is prove it belongs among the nation's elite. The Lady Vols lost 76-53 at Baylor, now the top-ranked team in the nation. They also fell 73-60 at home to Stanford, which was No. 1 when they played on Dec. 22. Monday's matchup against Notre Dame gives them another chance to show they're a legitimate Final Four contender. ''The second half with Baylor, I thought we competed,'' said Warlick, who played for Summitt and worked as her assistant for 27 seasons. ''I thought the first half, we were just totally scared. For Stanford for some reason, we didn't compete at all. ... Now we have a chance with another team out of the top three coming to our place. We've got to compete.'' Tennessee has been able to exceed preseason projections. The Lady Vols didn't return a single player who started an NCAA tournament game last year. The combination of a coaching change and roster upheaval led to them being ranked 20th in the preseason Top 25. SEC coaches picked Tennessee to end up fifth in the league, while the SEC media had the Lady Vols finishing fourth. ''I can't tell you how many people told me, `We're really not expecting (much from) you all, so you should have not a cushion, but a year that you can just develop and grow,' '' Warlick said. ''That motivated me, and I know it motivated our players. I knew what we had. I just didn't understand or know what we could do as a whole. I'm proud of them. We're only going to get better and better. We haven't reached our full potential.'' This year's Tennessee team is delivering the same type of results as Summitt's last few squads. After winning back-to-back national titles in 2007 and 2008, Tennessee went 22-11, 32-3, 34-3 and 27-9 in Summitt's last four seasons. The Lady Vols lost in the first round of the 2009 NCAA tournament, reached the Sweet 16 in 2010 and got to a regional final each of the last two years. Tennessee has overcome injuries that left the Lady Vols with only nine healthy players. Freshman guard Andraya Carter is out for the season with a torn labrum in her right shoulder. Sophomore forward Cierra Burdick has missed seven games with a broken right hand and is expected to return in early February. ''We always have a point to prove,'' Simmons said. ''Now this year since we are the underdog and people underestimate us. We have to remember Tennessee is Tennessee.'' The Lady Vols have benefited from the tenacity of Simmons, who averages 17.6 points per game and has a knack for delivering whenever her team needs a boost. ''She's super, super fast,'' Notre Dame guard Skylar Diggins said of Simmons. ''She has great speed. I think she can score in a variety of ways. She's a very emotional player. She can score in bunches.'' The Lady Vols have also gotten an instant impact from freshman forward Bashaara Graves, who has 14.5 points and 8.8 rebounds per game. And Tennessee's players say the coaching change hasn't been that big of an adjustment. Players already were accustomed to working with Warlick, who constantly preaches the importance of defense and rebounding by pointing out those traits were the hallmarks of Summitt's best teams. ''You hired the assistant that was there (27) years, so they're still going to respect the same qualities Pat instilled in Holly and in the program,'' Vanderbilt coach Melanie Balcomb said. ''She built a program and a tradition. That just gets passed down. There's a lot of generational leadership. It's not like someone from the outside came in and is going to change a lot of things. I'm sure (Warlick) has her own way of doing some things, but there's also going to be a lot of similarities to the way they've played in the past, absolutely. ''The one similarity right away is that they win.'' Now they're looking for that signature victory. Last season, Tennessee fell 72-44 at Notre Dame in the second-most lopsided loss of Summitt's tenure. After that game, the coaching staff covered the walls of the Lady Vols' locker room with pieces of paper showing the final score. ''They got after us and they by far were a better team than we were last year,'' Warlick said. ''We weren't even close. Sure we're going to use it to motivate us to see where we are, as a measuring stick for us.'' One year later, they have a chance to earn revenge and make one more statement that they're not going away in the post-Summitt era. Already this season, they've surprised just about everyone but themselves. ''We saw the talent we had in the offseason,'' Spani said. ''You could see the chemistry of this team and the development of the skill level. ''Honestly, we're disappointed we have three losses.'' AP Sports Writers Teresa Walker in Nashville, Tenn., and Tom Coyne in South Bend, Ind., contributed to this report.",Raw Data

Redknapp lamented his side's defending for MK Dons' opening two goals and admits he desperately needs to bolster his squad before the transfer window closes if they are to improve. ""I thought we played well in the first half but gave two diabolical goals away and found ourselves 2-0 down,"" fumed Redknapp. ""We came out second half, their third goal was offside but that's no excuse, and the fourth was sloppy from us as well. Their first two goals gave us a mountain to climb and we couldn't climb it."" Asked if the team he put out was good enough to beat MK Dons, Redknapp said: ""Absolutely, of course. ""Look at the team. We have got an England goalkeeper, a right-back from Man Utd, left-back Traore, Anton Ferdinand and Ben Haim.

Thanks to his fifth win of the Alpine ski season, the super-G Olympic champion also secured the ninth World Cup trophy of his career. ""It's fabulous to win the race and the super-G World Cup in front of my home crowd and my father, who was here to see me,"" Svindal told reporters. ""Unlike at the world championships, the number 22 bib brought me luck,"" added the Norwegian, who had to settle for the bronze medal at the worlds in Schladming last month. Austria's Georg Streitberger was second in the race, 0.52 adrift, ahead of Italian Werner Heel, who was a further 0.05 back. Svindal, second in Saturday's downhill behind Frenchman Adrien Theaux, increased the pressure on overall World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria, whom he trails by 29 points with seven races left. ""Hirscher, the way he is skiing this season, can score 180 points next weekend in Kranjska Gora so he remains the clear favourite,"" Svindal said.

321,"Hector ""Macho"" Camacho's life was full of tumult, yet the toll of time and the demons from his personal life didn’t keep him away from the ring. Sadly, the unfortunate end to Camacho’s life, as well as his boxing career, came as the result of a drive-by shooting. His family was forced to discontinue life support Saturday for a man who never went down without a fight. Reflections on his career have begun, and we'll begin with this one: We have lost one of the greats. When we look back at his career, the one thing that stands out is that he fought for a significant period of time, fought some of the best fighters of both his generation and all time … and managed to win nearly every time. The fact that he was considering a fight in 2013, at the age of 50, shows us that Camacho’s boxing career was one of sustained excellence. He may have fought sporadically toward the end of his career, but even after the age of 40 Camacho went 5-2-1 against respectable competition. In an age when many fighters have long since left the sport, he still managed to rack up a number of victories for the love of the sport as opposed to fighting (and losing) because he needed the money. When you look at his prime years as a fighter, the list of guys he fought becomes all that much more remarkable: Rafael Limon, Jose Luis Ramirez, Edwin Rosario, Ray Mancini, Julio Cesar Chavez, Felix Trinidad, Cornelius Boza-Edwards, Roberto Duran, Vinny Pazienza, Greg Haugen, Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard and Oscar De La Hoya. Usually someone with that resume is a stepping stone on the way up or an elite level fighter who took on everyone that mattered. Camacho was the latter, of course, and it's proven by a single, astonishing fact. None of those opponents, who in their own rights have stopped laundry lists of opponents, stopped Camacho. The man fought De La Hoya, Chavez and Trinidad (among others) when they were at their peaks in the lightweight division. Over 30 years, to face some of the hardest punchers in the sport, and some of the best fighters in the sport’s history, and never to have been stopped is a remarkable accomplishment. To go that many rounds with so many guys known for knocking out people, and lasting long enough to hear the final bell as well as listen to the judges’ scorecards, is a feat of legends. The fact that he fought professionally for more than three decades while maintaining such a record, elevates Camacho into the upper echelon. To put it in perspective, it would take boxing’s two best age-defying fighters, James Toney and Bernard Hopkins, another six years to match that output. We remember those who died in the sports world in 2012. And this doesn't take into account Camacho's amateur fights. Plenty of fighters have had substantial careers as professionals, but don’t have 100-plus fights as an amateur to boot. Add in a number of Golden Gloves championships to match four world titles, and it’s a body of work that almost feels fictional. And sadly, this ""Rocky""-like career has met an abrupt and tragic end. Camacho will, and should always be remembered as a world-class fighter, despite all the drama that accompanied his private life. His contribution to the sport of boxing will never be forgotten.",Raw Data
322,"During a busy offseason, the Denver Nuggets added three players in the draft, re-signed young free-agent center JaVale McGee, traded for All-Star and Olympian Andre Iguodala and agreed to a contract extension with starting point guard Ty Lawson. The most underrated move of the summer took place on July 11 when the Nuggets re-signed veteran point guard Andre Miller. Capable of starting for any team in the NBA, Miller returned to back up the speedy Lawson and serve as a calming influence in coach George Karls uptempo pass-oriented offense. It gave the organization and the coaches a freedom to pursue how to make the team better, Karl said after practice Wednesday. The foundation had to be there. Ty needs someone to push him and support him. If you got an injury, having a guy who could start and give you starting performances is a luxury in this league. Denver enjoyed that luxury Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Clippers. With Lawson sidelined by a strained left Achilles tendon, Miller stepped into the starting lineup and helped guide the Nuggets to a 92-78 victory. Miller, a starter in his first 12 NBA seasons, finished with 12 points and a season-high 12 assists in 41 minutes. (Karl) asked me if I was tired or not, and it was one of those games that wasnt as uptempo as people thought, Miller said. It was kind of a methodical game, so I kind of fell into some time where I could find a little rest on the court. With Lawson listed as day-to-day heading into Thursdays game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Miller could be in line for another heavy workload. I doubt it would be as many minutes, Miller said, but whatever the team needs. Miller, now in his 14th NBA season, is two points from 15,000 in his career. He will become the eighth player in league history to record at least 15,000 points and 7,500 assists. That list includes Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson and John Stockton. In typical Miller fashion, he shrugged at the mention of the milestone. Being out there enough, I guess its an accomplishment, he said. Thats a good deal. When Miller became a free agent last summer, many observers thought he would seek an opportunity to be a starter elsewhere. In the end, his family situation was a key reason for staying in Denver. Having my house here and having a new baby played a part in not wanting to be moving all around, Miller said. It was a win-win situation. Comfortable both on and off the court, Miller is averaging 8.6 points and 5.4 assists while providing the Nuggets with stability and leadership. Such traits should never be underrated.",Raw Data

Im sure that Lewis will perform one last dance as he enters the field but that isnt the only unique thing that he will be sporting. Lewis will be playing his last game with a uniquely customized pair of golden Under Armour FW13 cleats. And Id have to say, these cleats are pretty awesome. On the toe of the cleats, it reads Psalms 91. This honors the t-shirt worn by Lewis under his pads at his last home game as a Baltimore Ravens linebacker. Source: Under Armour Football These are the inside soles of Lewis customized Super Bowl cleats. I think this is the best idea that Under Armour came up with. The linings acknowledge all of Lewis career accomplishments. On the left sole, we see his regular season statistics and on the right sole, they have included his post-season statistics. Source: Under Armour Football And one final shot of the customized cleats, the tongue of the shoe features his initials and jersey number, 52. Source: Under Armour Football Overall, I am highly impressed with Under Armours design for Lewis Super Bowl cleats. They represent his successful career with the gold shoe, his accomplishments with the linings and then a few subtle touches special for Lewis. Under Armour created a motivational shoe without going over-the-top and making them obnoxious. Lewis has been loyal to the Ravens since they first drafted him in 1996. He has only had one Super Bowl championship, but there is a good chance that the Ravens could pull off another Super Bowl win against the San Francisco 49ers tomorrow.

324,"Greg Couch has been a national columnist at AOL Fanhouse and The Sporting News and an award-winning columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was featured twice in “Best American Sports Writing” and was recognized this year by the US Tennis Writers Association for best column writing and match coverage. He covers tennis on his personal blog. We like to analyze flip-flops, and wonder if they make people flighty, liars, attention-grabbers or fearful or something. Chip Kelly might well be all of those, though I lean against “liar.’’ Sure, he told Oregon last week that he was turning down the offer from the Philadelphia Eagles, and staying. And on Wednesday he was announced as the new Eagles coach. But Kelly meant what he said last week, as well as what he said Wednesday. He’d always wanted to be in the NFL, and always said he’d listen to offers. His offer at Tampa Bay last year didn’t include enough control, so he went back to Oregon. This year, with so many NFL openings, you had to assume he would jump. When Kelly stayed at Oregon last week, he didn’t make any false pleas about his love of the college game, or of Oregon. In fact, he really didn’t say anything. Neither did Oregon, which suggested that they still figured he might take some NFL job. It’s unknown if the Eagles altered their offer, adding more control, or if Kelly just thought about it for a week and decided he had made a mistake. But when your head goes up into the clouds, the way his did when NFL teams came calling, sometimes it’s hard to go back to work. After he turned down the Eagles, he had to come back to recruiting, the part of the job few coaches enjoy, and some resent. On top of that, Oregon already knows it violated NCAA rules under Kelly, making payments to a Texas street agent, Will Lyles, whose job was to get recruits to go to Oregon. It was a storyline reported heavily by Yahoo! Sports, among others. Oregon self-investigated, and then told the NCAA what it thought had happened, and suggested what it considered an appropriate punishment. The NCAA disagreed, and decided to move forward with the investigation. Did Kelly just run from the NCAA? That was not likely the biggest reason, or he would have taken the job in the first place. But it had to matter. Oregon could be banned from the postseason next season. Pete Carroll has changed everything for college coaches. His success with the Seattle Seahawks, after he left USC to run from NCAA sanctions, showed so many things. For the NFL, it showed that college coaches can do the job in the NFL. Jim Harbaugh showed the same thing, which is why so many NFL teams have been after college coaches the past few weeks. For college coaches, Carroll also showed that the NFL can be the great get-out-of jail-free card. For so long, college coaches had to worry that breaking the rules could leave them out of work, albeit with a lot of money. Now, you can break rules to win, and use that success to go to the NFL. Life decisions are rarely made on one thing alone. Some coaches just see the NFL as the pinnacle of the profession. In Kelly’s case, his mindset is just as hyper and as his offenses. Surely he wants to see if his ideas on offense will work in the NFL. The league’s focus has been changing, which is why the new head-coaching hires have all been offensive guys. ""Chip Kelly will be an outstanding head coach for the Eagles,’’ Philadelphia owner Jeffrey Lurie said in a statement. “He has a brilliant football mind. He motivates his team with his actions as well as his words. He will be a great leader for us and will bring a fresh, energetic approach to our team.’’ It’s possible. But Kelly will have to change, and also adapt his personal style to suit NFL players. NFL offenses are more up-tempo now, allowing quarterbacks to run and looking a little more like college offenses. That’s what makes Kelly so appealing. But I don’t think that will last, actually, as quarterbacks take too much of a beating and defensive coordinators figure it out. They’ll get there. Kelly’s tempo will provide a wrinkle to coordinators for a while. The problem is, his up-tempo style in practice, mixed with his thin skin and giant ego, will be a disaster when dealing with NFL stars. He’ll need a quarterback with the Eagles, and already people are wondering if that means Michael Vick will be back. Don’t count on it. He costs too much (would be guaranteed $15 million to stay with the Eagles in this current contract), and already took too much of a beating under Andy Reid’s system. No, Kelly will need a new quarterback while putting in his system. But the Eagles do have some speed, and, unlike Reid, Kelly will use it. Still, I’m not predicting big things for Kelly in the NFL. I’m not even predicting he’ll be there for three years. Plenty of big college jobs will be open by 2015, and when pro reality hits Kelly, college reality will start looking good again. It’s just the way his brain works. But for now, this week, Kelly is in the NFL for the long run.",Raw Data
325,"But after Nani came on as a late first half substitute for the injured Phil Jones, he turned the game on its head, scoring the first and setting up a second for Javier Hernandez to put United in control of the tie. Jobi McAnuff pulled a goal back to make it a nervy last 10 minutes for the home side but, despite a typical late Reading charge, United held firm to keep Sir Alex Ferguson’s dreams of a second historic treble alive. United came out of the blocks like a steam train and could have been two up in the opening two minutes. Danny Welbeck combined with Hernandez on the edge of the box but the Mexican dallied slightly too long in getting his shot away, his blocked shot falling to Welbeck who miscued his effort to Valencia, who in turn headed over. A minute later and Welbeck had a second chance after being played in on goal by Ashley Young and this time he caught his shot well, forcing Adam Federici into a fine save low to his left. Despite their early chances, Reading did well to weather the early storm and began to dominate possession. The visitors forced a succession of corners and two fine clearing headers from Nemanja Vidic under pressure from Sean Morrison kept the scores level. But it was United who continued to create the better chances and Federici was forced into a fantastic double save, palming Tom Cleverley’s fierce drive into the path of Welbeck before reacting brilliantly to turn his goalbound effort around the post. Reading continued to press United into mistakes all over the pitch with a relentless work rate and David De Gea was forced into a save of his own from an Adam Le Fondre shot that was arrowing into the corner. With under 10 minutes of a combative half remaining, Ferguson was forced into a reshuffle after a worrying knock to the ankle of Jones, who came off the worse after going for a 50-50 challenge with Adrian Mariappa. The England player later left Old Trafford on crutches and his fitness will be of concern to Ferguson with key fixtures coming up, including the Champions League last 16 second leg against Real Madrid on March 5. On came Nani and he had an immediate impact, crashing a first-time shot off Federici’s far post in the final minute of normal time in the half. And in the fourth minute of time added for a blood injury to Noel Hunt after a nasty early clash of heads with Vidic, United almost had the opener with the last kick of the half, Nani again forcing the Reading keeper into a fine save. United started the second half in the same vein as they had in the first, dominating possession and forcing the Reading players back on their heels. Anderson forced Federici into further heroics by palming his shot round for another corner before the increasingly influential Nani rifled a shot just wide. With Reading legs visibly tiring, one sensed the goal was coming and it came as no surprise when it came from the man wearing number 17, Nani firing home with the help of a slight deflection off Morrison’s hand. Straight from the kick-off and Reading were almost level, De Gea denying Le Fondre with a terrific reaction save after Hunt’s back header fell into the striker’s path. But Reading barely had time to reflect on the opportunity before they found themselves two down, Nani breaking free down the right before delivering a perfect cross onto the head of Hernandez, who timed his run perfectly to nod home. Reading have proved this season time and time again that they are nothing if not resilient. They have scored in the final 10 minutes on no fewer than seven occasions and they were at it once again to make it a nervy ending for United’s players and fans. Hunt put enough pressure on Chris Smalling in the box for the ball to fall perfectly for McAnuff to slide under De Gea. And Reading almost sealed yet another memorable comeback with practically their last chance of the game from their most likely source, Le Fondre’s header deflecting just wide of the top corner in the final minute of injury time. MAN OF THE MATCH Nani – Manchester United: Came off the bench to change the game in United’s favour. Scored their first, set up their second and could have had more but for Federici in the Reading goal.

326,"Titans coach Mike Munchak has talked with Williams and is interested in adding him to his Tennessee staff, said a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke Sunday to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the Titans do not discuss personnel moves until they are finalized. Before the Titans could hire Williams, he must be reinstated by the league. Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him indefinitely for his role in the New Orleans Saints bounty program, and NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Sunday the league has not yet addressed Williams' potential reinstatement. Munchak did not immediately answer a message left by the AP on Sunday. The Titans coach has not talked with the media about his team since the day after the season ended. How quickly the league considers reinstating Williams may take at least a week with the San Francisco 49ers arriving in New Orleans on Sunday to kick off festivities leading up to the Feb. 3 Super Bowl. Williams is the only coach or player who has yet to return to the NFL in the wake of the bounty scandal. Goodell just lifted the suspension for New Orleans coach Sean Payton on Tuesday, nearly two weeks earlier than expected. Saints general manager Mickey Loomis was suspended for eight games and assistant head coach Joe Vitt for six. Four current or former Saints players were also suspended after an investigation found the club had a performance pool offering cash rewards for key plays, including big hits. The player suspensions eventually were overturned. Williams was the Saints defensive coordinator from 2009-11 and was hired by St. Louis in January 2012 by former Titans coach Jeff Fisher before being suspended indefinitely in March 20112. Williams' son, Blake, also was on Fisher's staff as the Rams' linebacker coach — but his contract was not renewed earlier this month. Munchak has known Williams since 1990. Munchak was playing for the then-Houston Oilers when Williams became an assistant coach with the team. They also coached together with the Oilers; Munchak oversaw the offensive line starting in 1994 and Williams rose from defensive assistant to coaching special teams, then linebackers and finally defensive coordinator. Williams left the Titans to become head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 2001 before becoming defensive coordinator with the Washington Redskins from 2004-07. He also was defensive coordinator in Jacksonville in 2008 before being hired by the Saints in 2009. Williams also has a relationship with Munchak's current defensive coordinator, Jerry Gray. When Williams left for Buffalo, Gray went with him and served as Williams' defensive coordinator with the Bills. Even though Gray currently has the job, the Titans' defense needs help and Munchak will be coaching for his job in 2013 after going 6-10 in his second season as head coach. One reason for the losing record was Tennessee's inability to stop anyone; the Titans set a franchise record allowing 471 points in 2012. The only change Munchak has made to his defensive staff was letting linebackers coach Frank Bush go and moving Chet Paralavecchio into the job from assisting with special teams. In Williams' last season with the Titans, Tennessee ranked first in the NFL in fewest yards allowed, first in passing yards allowed and third in rushing defense. The Titans also set a franchise-record for fewest points allowed with 191 with an aggressive defense.",Raw Data

Sports opinions? She’s never short of them. And love her or hate her, she’ll be just another one of the boys. Follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook. The war on the “war on Christmas” trudges into yet another year. No exit strategy has been settled upon, no deadline to withdraw from yearly finger pointing about who is destroying this Christian holy day. So we engage in the same fights about nativity scenes in courthouse lawns and express outrage about an $8.75-an-hour-clerk saying “Happy Holidays.” I have slight buy in with this “war on Christmas” narrative, especially as we inch closer and closer to turning what is a meaningful religious holiday for many into just another day of excessive consumption — of stuff, of food and of sports. Where this crowd loses me is how they can rage against the clerk following company policy yet be complicit with another slate of NBA games on Christmas Day this year. Because what says holy day more than Nuggets-Clippers? We will watch. Ratings say we watch in crazy numbers every year. And we would have watched the NFL, too, if it had played. The league made the decision this year not to have Monday Night Football since it would have fallen on Christmas Eve. If they had, I guarantee the ratings would have been crazy good. So who again is taking the meaning out of Christmas — corporations, sports league or us? Because while I fervently believe and annually write that the NBA and NFL should not play games on Christmas, what I also know for sure is NBA commissioner David Stern is not personally warring against anything, much less Jesus and Santa. This seems necessary to point out after San Francisco Chronicle columnist Bruce Jenkins accused Stern of “ruining Christmas for far too many people” in a recent column. He has since apologized, which is good because the column doubled down on this stupidity by saying Stern does this because -- wait for it -- “Stern, who celebrates Hanukkah, has no real feel for Christmas in the first place.” Like if Stern only had a personalized knitted stocking, a Christmas tree and a picture on Santa’s lap to draw on from his childhood, he would quit tempting us with Lakers-Knicks. The column fits perfectly into the false outrage about the “war of Christmas.” We are always blaming others — Stern, atheist parents, Jewish parents, the First Amendment and its clear and concise language about a separation of church and state — for taking Christ out of Christmas. This is a straw man. Christ cannot be taken out of Christmas without our express written permission, just like God cannot be taken out of Yom Kippur. He is always there. The real question is do we include Him in our celebration? Because we choose how we celebrate the day — with a TV blaring or with conversation with family, with Kobe or with the guy we proclaim is the reason for the season. I happen to disagree with playing games on Christmas. Full disclosure: This is slightly selfish. I hate being away from my family on Christmas, and Thanksgiving for that matter. I know I am not alone. I have had many NBA and NFL players tell me how much they hate playing on a day that is very meaningful to them and their faith. There are bigger reasons, too. It would not kill us to have a couple of days of the year where our focus is on our families, where our TVs are off, where the centerpiece of a day we proclaim to be holy is not sports. This is not judgment. There is no right way to celebrate. Church. Or floor seats. A game of Scrabble. Or Knicks-Lakers. Tree. Or menorah. Or none of the above. It is less about the games and more about the hypocrisy. We demand everybody respect our holiday, but do we? Is turning Christmas into just another day of sports really respectful? The truth is scheduling games on Christmas is good business for the NBA. Why Stern has his league play games from sun up to sundown on Christmas Day is because we watch them. It has nothing to do with faith or lack thereof, and absolutely nothing to do with the faith of the commissioner. The NHL (when it is actually having seasons) shuts down on Dec. 24 and 25 not because commissioner Gary Bettman “has a feel for Christmas.” He is Jewish. It has to do with him listening to players who said they wanted to be home with their families. When we talked a year ago about the NHL’s decision not to play on Christmas, Bettman and I actually laughed at the idea that he would not get this because he is Jewish. “Christmas is one of those days in North America where, no matter what religion you are, things come to a halt,” he said at the time. “And is that such a bad thing?” What Bettman seems to get better than anybody is what I have written many times. We do not exclude others when we insist on honoring our beliefs and keeping them holy. We exclude others when we refuse to do likewise for them when it comes to theirs. We do not honor the Reason for the season when we demand people say Merry Christmas, or scream about the lack of a decorated tree at the public school, or put the onus on others to make our days holy.

328,"It began like any other Saturday for the Kansas City Chiefs during the NFL season, their general manager and coach at work early to put final touches on this weekend's gameplan. Then they got a call to hurry to the parking lot. The two men rushed through the glass doors of Chiefs headquarters and came face-to-face with linebacker Jovan Belcher, holding a handgun to his head. Belcher had already killed his girlfriend and sped the short distance to Arrowhead Stadium, right past a security checkpoint guarding the entrance. Upon finding his bosses, Belcher thanked general manager Scott Pioli and head coach Romeo Crennel for giving him a chance in the NFL. Then he turned away and pulled the trigger. The murder-suicide shocked a franchise that has been dealing with controversies now made trivial by comparison: eight consecutive losses, injuries too numerous to count, discontent among fans and the prospect that Pioli and Crennel could be fired at season's end. Authorities did not release a possible motive while piecing together the case, other than to note that Belcher and his girlfriend, 22-year-old Kasandra M. Perkins, had been arguing frequently. The two of them left behind a 3-month-old girl. She was being cared for by family. The Chiefs issued a statement that said their game Sunday afternoon against the Carolina Panthers would go on as scheduled, even as the franchise tried to come to grips with the awfulness of Belcher's death. ""The entire Chiefs family is deeply saddened by today's events, and our collective hearts are heavy with sympathy, thoughts and prayers for the families and friends affected by this unthinkable tragedy,"" Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt said in brief a statement. A spokesman for the team told The Associated Press that Crennel plans to coach on Sunday. ""I can tell you that you have absolutely no idea what it's like to see someone kill themselves,"" said Kansas City Mayor Sly James, who spoke to Pioli shortly after the shootings.

That's what it's like,"" James said. ""It's unfathomable."" Chiefs quarterback Brady Quinn told The Kansas City Star that when the team met later Saturday morning, Crennel broke the news to them. ""It was obviously tough for coach to have to tell us that,"" Quinn said. ""He really wasn't able to finish talking to us. We got together and prayed and then we moved on."" But Quinn said the team was so stunned, it was hard to digest what had happened. ""It's hard mostly because I keep thinking about what I could have done to stop this,"" he said. ""I think everyone is wondering whether we would have done something to prevent this from happening."" The 25-year-old Belcher was from West Babylon, N.Y., and played college football at Maine. He signed with the Chiefs as an undrafted free agent, made the team and hung around the past four years, eventually moving into the starting lineup. He played in all 11 games this season. The NFL released a statement expressing sympathy and pledging ""to provide assistance in any way that we can."" The players' association has also been in touch with members of the Chiefs. ""We sincerely appreciate the expressions of sympathy and support we have received from so many in the Kansas City and NFL communities, and ask for continued prayers for the loved ones of those impacted,"" Hunt said. ""We will continue to fully cooperate with the authorities and work to ensure that the appropriate counseling resources are available to all members of the organization."" The drama unfolded early Saturday when authorities received a call from a woman who said her daughter had been shot multiple times at a residence about five miles from the Arrowhead complex. The call came from Belcher's mother, who referred to the victim as her daughter. ""She treated Kasandra like a daughter,"" Kansas City police spokesman Darin Snapp said, adding that the woman had recently moved in with the couple, ""probably to help out with the baby."" Police then got a phone call from the Chiefs' training facility, and Belcher's description matched the suspect description from the initial address. Snapp said officers pulled into the practice facility parking lot in a matter of minutes, in time to witness the suicide. ""Pioli and Crennel and another coach or employee was standing outside and appeared to be talking to him,"" Snapp said. ""The suspect began to walk in the opposite direction of the coaches and the officers and that's when they heard the gunshot. It appears he took his own life."" The coaches told police they never felt in any danger. ""They said the player was actually thanking them for everything they'd done for him,"" Snapp said. ""He was thanking them and everything. That's when he walked away and shot himself."" Members of the Chiefs mostly laid low Saturday, but a few reacted on Twitter. ""I am devastated by this mornings events,"" Pro Bowl linebacker Tamba Hali wrote. ""I want to send my thoughts and prayers out to everyone effected by this tragedy."" A large group of Belcher's friends and relatives gathered Saturday at his boyhood home on Long Island. His family turned the front yard into a shrine, with a large poster of Belcher, an array of his trophies, and jerseys and jackets from Kansas City, Maine and West Babylon High. ""He was a good, good person ... a family man. A loving guy,"" said family friend Ruben Marshall, who said he coached Belcher in youth football. ""You couldn't be around a better person."" At least 20 people gathered for a large group hug in the driveway. ""He was a tremendous player and all those things, and his accolades speak for themselves, but he lit up when he spoke about his mom, or when he hugged his family after games,"" said Dwayne Wilmot, who was Belcher's position coach at Maine and is now an assistant coach at Yale. ""It's difficult to talk about Jovan in the past tense,"" he told the AP. ""There's going to be unanswered questions, the why's of this tragedy. It'll never be truly known to us."" Wilmot said he'd stayed in touch with Belcher the past few years through social media. ""He was someone who took genuine pleasure in bringing happiness to others,"" Wilmot said. ""I was so excited when he became a father, because I knew he'd be a great father."" His girlfriend's Facebook page shows the couple smiling and holding the baby. Belcher is the latest among several players and NFL retirees to die from self-inflicted gunshot wounds during the past few years. The death of star linebacker Junior Seau, who shot himself in the chest in at his California home last May, sent shockwaves around the league. Seau's family, like those of other suicide victims, donated his brain tissue to medical authorities to determine if head injuries he sustained playing football might be linked to his death. That report has not been released, although an autopsy showed no underlying hemorrhaging or bruises on Seau's brain. Belcher did not have an extensive injury history, though he was listed as having a head injury on a report from Nov. 11, 2009. Belcher played four days later against the Oakland Raiders. Earlier this year, the NFL provided a grant to help establish an independently operated phone service that connects players, coaches, team officials and other staff with counselors trained to work through personal and emotional crises. The NFL Life Line is available 24 hours a day. The season has been a massive disappointment for the Chiefs, who were expected to contend for the AFC West title. They're 1-10 and mired in an eight-game skid marked by injuries, poor play and fan upheaval. During the past few weeks there have been constant calls for Pioli and Crennel to be fired. It's unknown how the Chiefs plan to pay tribute to Belcher during Sunday's game. ""His move to the NFL was in keeping with his dreams,"" said Jack Cosgrove, who coached Belcher at Maine. ""This is an indescribably horrible tragedy.""",Raw Data
329,"﻿Ryan Newman isn’t sure what the future holds. But Newman, 35, who finds himself in his second contract year in as many seasons, doesn’t seem the least bit concerned. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. “I’m here to represent my sponsor and win a championship,” Newman said. “I have my personal goals and I have my team goals. What happens, happens. What I do and where I end up, is where I end up. If I stay, I stay, If I don’t, I don’t. I have to do what’s best for me.” The driver of the No. 39 Stewart/Haas Racing Chevrolet earned a reprieve for 2013. After shopping the driver market last season, he accepted a one-year deal at a reduced pay rate to remain with the organization – his racing home since 2009. Quicken Loans has signed on for half of the races, but as is the case with Newman’s teammates Tony Stewart and Danica Patrick, sponsorship is needed for all three cars. Despite the uncertainty, Newman, insists that he’s not carrying a greater burden into this season. “I have no extra pressure on myself to perform at any time in my career,” Newman said. “I just don’t have the things done on paperwork to say what I’m doing in 2014. It doesn’t change how I drive this year. I give 100 percent each and every lap. There’s no 110 percent. There’s only 100 percent. I’ve always done that and I always will. “It’s not a distraction to me. I don’t think it’s a distraction. It’s something I have to work on. It’s no different than what I’ve worked on my entire life. You just never know. It’s not like something is going to fall from the sky and land in your lap. You have to work at it. And my goal is to work on what I need to work on this year. It will all come together.” However, with the addition of Patrick to the fold, Newman lost crew chief Tony Gibson and his team for the last four years which were recruited for the No. 10 team to bring the rookie up to speed. For Newman, that means a reunion with his former Penske Racing crew chief Matt Borland. When Newman started his Cup career in 2000, Borland was there to call the shots. Together, the only combination of driver/crew chief with engineering degrees in the garage, won 12 races together and 37 of Newman’s 49 career poles – which earned him the moniker “Rocketman”. But when the team went winless in 2006, Borland left the company. After a short stint at Michael Waltrip Racing, Borland accepted the position of competition director at Haas CNC Racing – the forerunner of Stewart Haas Racing. TRUE TEST NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers tried out the new-model car at Daytona. Take a look! After the partnership was formed between Tony Stewart and Gene Haas, Borland assumed the role of vice president of competition. He’ll retain that job in addition to guiding the No. 39 team this year. Considering the success Newman enjoyed with Borland in the past, he is confident the pair can rekindle their previous spark. And with their engineering backgrounds, Newman believes the team will have an advantage getting up to speed with the new Generation 6 car. “I’m really excited to have Matt back as the crew chief,” Newman said. “Most people don’t realize that he was the best man at my wedding (in 2004). He has a great personal connection as well as a performance connection. And we look forward to getting back to Victory Lane. “We think a lot alike. Sometimes it’s scary. We have our past. We know where we succeeded – and we know where we failed. Overcoming those failures is what makes you stronger yet. That’s why I’m excited to be back with him this year because we know how good we can be. We know where we failed and we know that adapting to a new race car, we can do it again. It’s still physics.” Considering his friendship with Newman and the precarious situation the driver is in, Borland says he “absolutely feel(s) the pressure”. “I don’t know if it’s different – less or more than what Roger (Penske) would put on us at times,” Borland said. Roger never says no to anything but you have to perform. I feel we really have to step up and run well this year. It’s very important for him. “He’s one of the greatest drivers out there. He has the ability to do all those things so if he’s not doing that, that’s something that we’re not doing right as far as getting the cars ready. From that aspect there’s probably less pressure because we know there’s somebody that can get the job done. We just need to get the job done.” CHECK IT OUT Chevrolet has officially unveiled its 2013 Sprint Cup model. If Newman has a competitive flaw, it’s that he’s too aggressive. Despite his talent for winning poles, he’s converted just four into wins throughout his Cup career. In 2012, Newman scored his third win under the SHR banner which elevated him to a season-high eighth in the point standings six races into the year. But an engine failure four races later at Talladega compounded by a run-in with Kurt Busch at Darlington the following week knocked Newman down to 14th in the point standings where he ultimately finished the year. Certainly, bringing Borland back on the pit box will keep Newman motivated and provide him the best opportunity to showcase his talent as he auditions for his next ride. “We started off strong last year and it just kind of fell apart. We won early, which was nice. But even with that win – which would have gotten us into the Chase in 2011 – it didn’t get us into the Chase in 2012. As (competition director Greg) Zipadelli said, ‘you can’t just sit there and feel like you’re happy because you have speed, it takes teamwork, it takes a lot of things to be successful and have a shot at the championship.”",Raw Data

331,"Mike Thibault, who led the Connecticut Sun to eight playoff appearances but no WNBA championships in his 10 seasons, was fired by the team on Tuesday. Thibault had been the Sun's only coach, hired when the team relocated from Orlando before the 2003 season. He led the Sun to the WNBA Finals in 2004 and 2005, and five Eastern Conference Finals. The Sun finished the 2012 season as the top seed in the East with a 25-9 record. Led by league MVP Tina Charles, the team swept New York in the first round of the playoffs before losing to eventual WBNA champion Indiana in three games in the conference finals. ''We have the ultimate respect and appreciation for everything coach Thibault has done here, and he has played a huge part in establishing the Connecticut Sun as the model franchise in the league,'' said Mitchell Etess, the Sun's chief executive officer. ''However, our ultimate goal is the championship, and this change is made in with an eye to accomplishing just that.'' Sun assistants Scott Hawk and Bernadette Mattox also were let go. Thibault had a 206-134 regular-season record with the Sun and was named the WNBA Coach of the Year in 2006 and 2008. He needs just six more victories to pass former Houston Comets coach Van Chancellor for the most wins in WBA history. Thibault, who came to the Sun after being an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks, said he turned down an opportunity this summer to return the NBA because he felt into wouldn't be fair to his players. He said he's disappointed not to be able to finish the job in Connecticut with a championship, something he felt the team was close to achieving. ''I think we were headed in the right direction,'' he said. ''I think if you ask the players, they think we were headed in the right direction. But I'm not the one to set the direction anymore.'' Thibault said he has not ruled out returning to the WNBA with another team, but wants to take his time to consider his options before making his next career move. Sun officials said they would begin formally interviewing candidates for their coaching job immediately, but set timetable to name Thibault's replacement. ''We are committed to bringing a WNBA championship to our loyal fans, who have given us tremendous support our first 10 seasons,'' general manager Chris Sienko said. ''We have several candidates in mind who we believe can help us accomplish that goal. ''Ultimately, we want to find the best fit for our athletes and this organization.''",Raw Data
332,"Stephan El Shaarawy scored his first goal in five games to down 10-man Atalanta and fire AC Milan up to fifth in the Serie A table. The prodigiously talented striker had gone missing over recent games, having provided Milan's biggest threat in the first half of the season, but his clinical finish gave the visitors the lead at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia. Atalanta refused to surrender, though, and their bid for a first win in six games only unraveled when Davide Brivio was sent off for picking up two yellow cards in the second half. From that point on Milan might have run riot, but they failed to capitalize on a host of gilt-edged chances as time ticked away. Mathieu Flamini made Milan's intentions clear with a fierce strike from distance in the fourth minute, but Andrea Consigli parried the ball to safety. Atalanta have proved to be dangerous on the break this season and Facundo Parra was desperately unlucky not to convert German Denis' fine slide-rule pass in front of Christian Abbiati. El Shaarawy showed his worth on the counter-attack too, almost beating Brivio into the box before another penetrative run was ended by the imposing Guglielmo Stendardo. But the young striker's 17th goal of the season would come in the 29th minute. French striker M'Baye Niang, who excelled in Milan's win at Bologna, tricked his way up the right wing to find El Shaarawy lurking, the 20-year-old gratefully tucking the ball beyond Consigli. Atalanta's resolve might well have faded at that point but the Nerazzurri continued to surge forward, Abbiati foiling a dangerous move between Denis and Giacomo Bonaventura. Niang's daisy-cutter sent Consigli sprawling moments later but Milan would carry the narrowest of margins into the break. Flamini failed to make the most of another incisive ball from Niang as play resumed, with Stendardo soon scrambling the ball away from Giampaolo Pazzini's quick feet. Blows were exchanged towards the hour mark as Consigli pushed a Pazzini backheel away from danger. At the other end, Parra held the ball up to release Denis in the area, but Abbiati leapt off his line to rescue a corner. The odds tipped in Milan's favor when Brivio, who had been booked shortly after the restart, picked up a second yellow card and his marching orders. Atalanta did not lose heart and influential midfielder Carlos Carmona soon put his body on the line to cut out a vicious finish from Flamini. Rather than exploit the space, Milan began to waste decent chances, Riccardo Montolivo fluffing a close-range effort before Flamini scooped the ball away from an open goal. The match was degenerating fast and, with time running out, Atalanta boss Colantuono was sent to the stands for continually protesting referee Andrea Gervasoni's decisions.",Raw Data
333,"He leads Barca in the last-16 first leg tie in the absence of Tito Vilanova, who is recovering from throat surgery, just over 23 years after Roura damaged ligaments in his right knee during a Supercup game involving the same two clubs. Although Roura, who was 22 at the time, continued playing for several more years he was never the same and was shunted around lower-tier clubs Murcia, Figueres and finally Sant Andreu before quitting. ""I don't have happy memories of my match against Milan 23 years ago,"" said the interim coach who has spent much of his career far from the glamour of the Champions League. ""After the injury I couldn't play football any more,"" he told a news conference on Tuesday. ""Milan had a great team then. ""I have returned several times since then as part of the Barcelona staff. A lot has happened since, life always gives you more opportunities,"" added Roura. ""It's always nice for someone who likes football to come to this stadium although it is always a daunting prospect to play Milan here."" Roura had a low-profile coaching career before being thrown into the spotlight thanks to Barca's policy of stability and promoting from within. He had a workmanlike career in the Spanish lower leagues which reached a low point when he was fired by third-tier Hospitalat in 2007. When Vilanova's predecessor Pep Guardiola took over at Barca, Roura joined the staff initially to watch future opponents. He dismissed the suggestion Barca, who have dominated La Liga this season, are firm favourites to beat a Milan side who are rebuilding after selling a raft of players at the end of last term to cut costs. ""I don't agree at all,"" said Roura. ""I've said it a lot of times - Milan are one of the best, they are a very good team and this is a very difficult stadium. ""I don't understand this heavy favouritism, it doesn't make sense. It's very strange.""",Raw Data
334,"﻿ Michael Bisping explains, in about the only way the brash Brit can, why he’s not looking past Saturday’s opponent atop the UFC on FX 7 card, Vitor Belfort. “You have to remain focused or he’ll punch you in the back of the head,” Bisping told FOXSports.com. “He fights dirty.” A victory by Bisping assures him a shot at middleweight champ Anderson Silva, an opportunity that has eluded Bisping in the UFC. It doesn’t seem to faze Bisping that he’ll have to conquer Belfort in his native Brazil. “I’m looking forward to that,” Bisping said. “We’re right there in his backyard. He’ll have no excuses about the judging. He can’t blame the food or the travel or anything like that. I’m going into his territory.” Maybe not geographically, but competitively this is well-traveled ground for Bisping. He’s been seemingly a fight away from being declared the No. 1 contender for much of a UFC career that began in 2006. Bisping, 33, was most recently primed for a breakthrough last January, but he lost a unanimous decision to Chael Sonnen. The defeat was Bisping’s only setback over his last six fights. While it was a tough loss, Bisping knows he can't dwell on the past. Jon Jones. Chael Sonnen. What more could you want? New episodes Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on FX. “After that fight, I sat on the couch and drank a cold one,” Bisping said. “I wanted to be impartial and honest. I watched it. I thought I won. I had another beer and watched it again. I won that time, too. But that’s old news. I can’t be making any mistakes against Belfort. He is a dirty fighter.” Belfort doesn’t seem to be amused by Bisping’s rants. “I don’t pay attention to what anybody says,” Belfort said. “Nothing can affect my brain. If you pay attention to what other people say, it’s going to change what I’m doing. He may get attention from what he says about me. It doesn’t matter to me. “What do I think about him? I think he should just go in there and fight. That’s it.” Belfort and Bisping enter UFC on FX in very different positions. Bisping bounced back from his loss to Sonnen with a win over Brian Stann at UFC 152 in September. Belfort’s last fight also came at UFC 152 as he stepped up a division in place of an injured Lyoto Machida. Belfort was submitted by light heavyweight champ Jon Jones in the fourth round. Unlike Bisping, UFC president Dana White said that Belfort — who lasted less than a round against Silva two years ago — will not get a chance at the middleweight title. “I don’t think about it,” Belfort said. “Thinking something doesn’t give you the right to have it. He’s the boss. You just have to follow the rules. I’m a hungry fighter. I’m going to go in there to win.” Two of the top middleweight fighters — Tim Boetsch and Alan Belcher — stumbled last month at UFC 155. For Bisping, it was a reminder of just how fleeting the opportunities — like his on Saturday — can be. “I don’t want to fall on the last hurdle,” Bisping said. “There’s tremendous pressure to perform. I’m a sadistic bastard. I’m pushing myself more and more. I’m working harder and harder. I snap at my coaches and training partners. I want the best out of myself because I’m so close. The stakes are higher.”",Raw Data
335,"The biggest star in boxing dropped a surprise Tuesday while announcing his long-rumored next bout: After several years on HBO, Mayweather is moving to Showtime with a lucrative multi-fight deal. Mayweather's move is a coup for Showtime, the CBS-owned network that has always trailed behind HBO in boxing prominence. Mayweather (43-0, 26 KOs) is the sport's biggest moneymaker, and his new revenue-sharing deal with Showtime could include up to six pay-per-view fights over 30 months. ''They were extremely aggressive from the start, and they made it clear they want Floyd Mayweather to be the face of Showtime,'' Mayweather adviser Leonard Ellerbe told The Associated Press. ''It's the ultimate compliment to a fighter like Floyd. They were aggressive, and the deal that they put on the table was essentially a deal that you can't refuse.'' Mayweather's first bout is against Guerrero (31-1-1, 18 KOs), the WBC's interim welterweight champion. The fight likely will be at the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas, the site of Mayweather's last six bouts. Mayweather turns 36 on Sunday, but the unbeaten WBC 147-pound champion has shown few signs of advancing age in the ring. He hasn't fought since beating Miguel Cotto last May 5, and he spent two months in jail last summer after his conviction in a misdemeanor domestic battery case. With Showtime as his new showcase, Ellerbe said Mayweather's fans will see much more in the next few years from the re-energized champion, who has fought just four times since December 2007. ''He has a renewed motivation to stay active and to take on everybody out there,'' Ellerbe said. ''When Floyd is more active, he's going to be beyond untouchable. He's proved he can stay sharp with those layoffs in the past, but he's going to be more active now.'' Guerrero beat out several contenders to get the biggest payday of his career and a shot at his sport's biggest name. Guerrero, from Gilroy, Calif., is a onetime featherweight champion who hasn't lost since 2005, beating welterweight Andre Berto in a thrilling fight last November. ''On May 4th I'm going to shock the world,'' Guerrero tweeted. Ellerbe said Mayweather chose Guerrero as his next opponent because of his toughness and crowd-pleasing style. ''He definitely earned the right to fight Floyd,'' Ellerbe said. ''He won the Mayweather sweepstakes, so now he gets to see what the grand prize is, and when he opens up that grand prize, it's going to be a can of (tail) whooping.'' Guerrero and Showtime Sports general manager Stephen Espinoza both felt lucky after Mayweather made his decision. Espinoza went after Mayweather before his last fight, but finally got his man after two weeks of negotiations. ''He is as compelling an entertaining a personality as there is in sports, and his performance is at the top of the sport as well,'' Espinoza told the AP. ''You don't often see those things in combination. Everything he does, everything he says generates reaction and discussion. Those are the people you want. We're thrilled to be working with Floyd.'' Mayweather has been on Time Warner-owned HBO for essentially his entire professional career, which began after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Along with his peerless pay-per-view prowess, Mayweather starred in HBO's popular ''24/7'' reality series before each of his past six bouts, further growing his celebrity with the four-episode showcases of his Vegas lifestyle and irrepressible personality. Want to follow what's going on in the ring? We've got everything you need with news and analysis, schedules, photos, video, current champions and more from around the boxing world. Any boxing fans who are worried about missing Mayweather on ''24/7'' can rest easy: Espinoza is forming his own plans to showcase Mayweather outside the ring. ''It would be a major failure if we didn't capture all that interesting stuff,'' Espinoza said. ''Literally within the next 24 hours, we're going to have cameras on him. We're going full speed ahead. What HBO has done is very impressive, and I respect their creative work. We have a slightly different approach, and we feel there's a lot of the Floyd Mayweather story and the personality that has not been exposed. We've seen one facet of him repeatedly, and we think that's only part of the story.'' Manny Pacquiao, another longtime HBO fixture, was Mayweather's only rival for boxing supremacy in recent years before the Filipino congressman's back-to-back losses last year. Top Rank promoter Bob Arum moved Pacquiao off HBO for one fight in 2011, beating Sugar Shane Mosley on Showtime, but returned to HBO for Pacquiao's next bout. HBO fought to keep Mayweather as well, but couldn't top Showtime. ''We made an aggressive and responsible pay-per-view offer,'' HBO said in a statement from spokesman Kevin Flaherty. ''Now we move on. We are focused on the best boxing franchise in the television business. We are proud of the roster of superstar fighters and emerging stars who are scheduled to appear on the multiple HBO television platforms this year.'' Mayweather usually partners with Golden Boy Promotions to organize his fights, but the boxer essentially serves as his own promoter and cuts his own financial deals with help from adviser Al Haymon. ''All the fighters and promoters out there should be applauding Floyd,'' Ellerbe said. ''He's elevating the sport and bringing more eyeballs to it. More importantly, he's changing the pay structure in the sport. He's setting that bar higher for everybody.'' Mayweather is making another big change for his next fight: He has hired his father, Floyd Sr., as his trainer. The younger Mayweather was estranged from his father for long stretches of the past several years while he trained under his uncle, Roger. Golden Boy is working on a deal to put Mexican star Saul ''Canelo'' Alvarez on the undercard of Mayweather's bout with Guerrero, possibly against Austin Trout. Alvarez, the WBC 154-pound champion, could be Mayweather's next opponent in September.",Raw Data

However, while Smith’s goal will have earned the club a lucrative replay at Goodison Park, his goal celebration has ended up costing him a week's wages. The 6' 6"" striker, who scored two goals in the previous round against Liverpool, sent Boundary Park into raptures by coming off the bench and heading home a corner in the fourth and last minute of injury time. However, in his jubilation he ignored a pre-match directive from the club that warned players about getting rid of their shirts as he threw his into the crowd. A sign on the dressing room before the match said: ""Please be advised that due to a severe shortage of first team home shirts, players must not give away their kit following the conclusion of the Everton match.""

Atletico started well and bossed the first half hour of play at La Rosaleda Stadium, when pressure applied by strike pair Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa led to Arda Turan's and Cristian Rodriguez's long-range attempts. But after a frenetic first half, the defenses reduced the match to an ugly stalemate for most of the final 45 minutes. Malaga was never able to find its flow in attack and was limited to defenders Martin Demichelis and Weligton going close with headers from set-pieces. By not winning, Atletico likely let escape its last chance to add some drama to the title race, with Barcelona reeling after two losses to Real Madrid this week and focusing on its last-16 Champions League series with AC Milan in which it needs to come back from a 2-0 deficit. Atletico trails Barcelona, which lost 2-1 at Madrid on Saturday, by 11 points in second place with 12 rounds to go. Atletico coach Diego Simeone, however, was content to take away a point four days after his team sealed its place in the Copa del Rey final against Madrid by eliminating Sevilla. ''My team dominated the game,'' Simeone said. ''We just lacked making that final pass to convert our 90 minutes of good play into a goal.'' Malaga stayed in fourth place, one point ahead of Valencia and clinging to Spain's final Champions League spot for next season. It also faces a key Champions League game against FC Porto in two weeks in which it must overturn a 1-0 loss in the first leg. Anoeta stadium was treated to one of the most entertaining games so far this season, as Sociedad and Betis put on a tireless display of attacking football that featured a double by Betis' Dorlan Pabon and five goals in a 17-minute span before ending in a deserved point for each. Only seconds after Sociedad's Imanol Agirretxe had hit the post, Jorge Molina capped a counterattack on the other end to give Betis the lead on the half-hour mark. Pabon doubled the visitors' advantage in the 49th by taking advantage of a defensive mistake to convert Benat Etxebarria's lobbed pass. Yet instead of folding, Sociedad responded in fine fashion and the game quickly became a shootout. Carlos Vela scored his 12th goal of the season for Sociedad two minutes later, and the Mexico forward then crossed for Inigo Martinez to head Sociedad level in the 56th. The Basque side then went ahead for the first time in the 62nd when Xabi Prieto converted a penalty in the ''Paneka'' chipped style after Angel Lopez had cut off a pass in the box with his arm. But Pabon struck for a second time in the 66th when the Colombia forward ran onto substitute Ruben Castro's pass and deftly slotted it beyond Bravo. ''It was a spectacular game to be savored with swings in the score, lots of goals and chances for more,'' said Molina. ''We played a great match against a rival that plays very much like we do.'' Sociedad extended its undefeated run to eight games and held onto sixth place, right in front of Betis. Elsewhere, Tomer Hemed's last-gasp header gave Mallorca a 2-1 win in stoppage time at Granada, breaking an eight-game winless run for the relegation-threatened club. Hemed muscled by his marker to reach Giovani dos Santos' corner, with Granada goalkeeper Antonio ''Tono'' Rodriguez getting a hand on the ball but not enough to keep it from crossing the line. It was the Israeli striker's eighth goal of the season and his first since November. Manuel ''Nolito'' Agudo opened the scoring for Granada in the eighth minute, only for Mallorca forward Alejandro Alfaro to level five minutes later from a cross by Dos Santos. Mallorca's first victory under new coach Gregorio Manzano lifted it four points from safety. Granada is three points from the drop. ''These points reinforce our morale and give us strength,'' said Manzano. ''We still need many more points. I wish today's win had been worth eight instead of just three. But this win means a lot for the team and our fans.'' In Barcelona, Espanyol's home winning run was ended at five games after it was held to a 0-0 draw by Valladolid, keeping both teams in the middle of the table. Later, Real Sociedad hosts Real Betis. Getafe eased by Real Zaragoza 2-0 on Friday. Also on Saturday, Levante drew 2-2 at Valencia, Athletic Bilbao won 1-0 at Osasuna, and last-place Deportivo La Coruna drew 0-0 with Rayo Vallecano. Sevilla hosts Celta Vigo on Monday.",Raw Data
340,"Basketball Australia said Thursday that Seattle Storm forward Lauren Jackson is expected to make a full recovery from a persistent right hamstring injury after undergoing surgery in Melbourne this week. Jackson was advised to undergo surgery after a series of tests to ascertain the full extent of the injury, which she first injured while playing with the Australian team in the lead up to the London Olympics and aggravated playing for Seattle. Orthopedic surgeon David Young was quoted in a statement as saying Jackson's the surgery was ''highly successful,'' with several problems being addressed in relation to the three-time WNBA most valuable player's injury, and the medical opinion that she will make a full recovery. Jackson has been advised to have complete rest for three weeks, after which she is expected to be able to start a light rehabilitation program. Jackson was supposed to begin a three-season deal with Australian club Canberra this year, but has not been able to take the court due to her injury. ''I'm very happy that I've now had this operation, and I'm delighted with the medical opinion that I should be able to make a full recovery,'' Jackson said in a statement.",Raw Data
341,"﻿ The Jovan Belcher murder-suicide story has rocked the sports world, with people attempting to make sense of this senseless tragedy. Bob Costas of NBC touched off a firestorm of reaction from across the country at halftime of Sunday night's Eagles-Cowboys game to speak to the issue of gun culture in America, reading liberally from Jason Whitlock's column on the issue. Tuesday morning, Costas told The Dan Patrick Radio Show that he made a ""mistake"" in trying to convey his intended points in a brief, 90-second segment on Sunday. “My mistake is I left it open for too much miscommunication,” told Patrick. “Here’s where I stand: I do not want to see the Second Amendment repealed. ... People should be allowed to own guns for their own protection. Obviously, those who are hunters. ... Access to guns is too easy in some cases. I don’t see any reason a citizen should be able to arm himself in some states in ways only police or military should — to have a virtual militia [by] mail order or gun shows. Why do you need a semi-automatic weapon? What possible use is there? ... Whitlock wrote about a gun culture. That’s what I was focusing on.” As the sports world continues to move forward in the wake of this horrible, yet somehow defining event, Whitlock and Costas have gotten together on this podcast to share their insights about the myriad issues related to this tragedy.",Raw Data
342,"The New York Knicks put themselves in an early, insurmountable hole Friday night against the visiting Chicago Bulls before rallying back to make the game look more competitive than it really was in a frustrating, 108-101 loss at Madison Square Garden. Hampered by injuries, seemingly always adjusting to what has become a revolving door of players and facing the toughest stretch of the schedule so far, New York has plenty of excuses for its current regression, during which the Knicks have now lost three straight games and eight of 13 since wowing the league with an unexpected 18-5 start. But chief among the Knicks’ compounding issues, as they try to hold on to the No. 2 spot in the East while the middle of the conference pack keeps gaining ground on New York and the top-ranked Miami Heat, is the team’s inability to play hard and play well from the opening tip. Chicago built a 15-point, first-quarter lead in Friday night’s win — the team’s second over New York in the last three weeks and third this season — as the Knicks missed 15 of their first 17 shots. And the Bulls pushed that advantage to as many as 25 in the second quarter as Carmelo Anthony missed 10 of his first 11 shots before taking a 57-36 lead into the break. Anthony heated up in the second half, hitting 10 of 18 attempts on his way to a game-high 39 points, and the Knicks cut the lead to as little as five late in the fourth quarter. But it was too little, too late — again — as New York dropped to 23-13 on the season, just one game ahead of Indiana, who beat the Knicks on Thursday. The Knicks also are1 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta and two games ahead of Chicago and No. 6 Brooklyn. Check out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo. “We could point the fingers at a lot of things, first with me — I’m the coach, I’ve got to get us out of this rut,” said coach Mike Woodson, who has lost two straight at home for the first time since taking over for Mike D’Antoni last season. “I don’t like the way we’re starting ballgames, because that’s going to be an indication of how we play throughout the course of a game. I thought last night at Indiana at least we had a defensive tone set early. Tonight we had none. They built the lead, and it was an uphill climb all the way.” Giving opponents a head start has become the norm of late for the Knicks, who, despite allowing the rest of the conference to gain ground in recent games, are still just one game out of first place in the East. In losses to the Pacers and Celtics this week, it was second-half dropoffs that did New York in, but a 12-point first-quarter deficit made an eight-point win over Orlando last Saturday harder than it needed to be, and the Knicks trailed by as many as 19 in the first half of a five-point loss in Portland on New Year’s Day. Lethargic first halves are not just a 2013 issue, either. New York rallied from a 27-point, first-half deficit against Sacramento on Dec. 28 before a buzzer-beater did it in, and Minnesota led by eight points after four minutes of a three-point Knicks victory on Dec. 23. Back on Dec. 21, Chicago led by 13 in the first quarter, 17 in the second and 25 in the third of a 110-106 win that was virtually identical to Friday night’s game. And in Jeremy Lin’s return to the Garden on Dec. 17, Houston led by 14 in the second quarter before taking a 27-point second-half lead in the loss that sparked New York's current slide. “Our starts have been too up and down, too inconsistent,” said Knicks center Tyson Chandler (nine points, 18 rebounds). “I wasn’t upset with our effort last night (against Indiana) at all. … Tonight, a little bit different story. We fought at the end, but that’s not good enough. We’ve got to be able to put together four quarters.” Outside of the obvious issue of forcing themselves to rally more often than they’d like, the Knicks have also been dealt a number of personnel blows that have made it difficult to keep playing at the untenable level they once did. This time a few months ago, no one would have ever fathomed that injuries to Rasheed Wallace and Raymond Felton could be holding the Knicks back, but both have been critical to New York’s success so far, and it’s no coincidence that the team has struggled with them out. Wallace, who came out of retirement to bolster the Knicks' frontcourt, has missed 14 straight games with a foot injury, and Felton missed his eighth straight game Friday with a broken right pinky finger. Felton’s injury has been especially problematic for the Knicks, as it has forced them to totally alter their offense, relying on the more slow-footed Jason Kidd and Pablo Prigioni to carry his weight. Without penetration by Felton, the Knicks’ Kidd and Prigioni-led offense looks a lot like last season’s team did, and it’s led to too much passing around the perimeter and contested 3-pointers. “We miss Raymond. We miss him pushing the tempo of the game,” said Anthony, who returned Friday from a one-game suspension (for confronting Kevin Garnett after Garnett trash-talked about Anthony's wife). “There’s a lot of things that, when he was playing, we were getting that we’re not getting right now. When we have different guys in the lineup, things change a lot.” In addition, Amar’e Stoudemire’s return to the lineup hasn’t necessarily made things any easier for the Knicks, but he hasn’t particularly hurt them, either, in his limited action thus far, and his defense has actually been above-average — especially for a guy who, in recent days, has said he’s never had a coach teach him D. The schedule has also not been kind and has pitted the Knicks against eight current playoff teams, the Lakers and the surprisingly competitive Timberwolves in the last 13 games. But it gets better. New York hosts lowly New Orleans on Sunday before heading abroad to play the equally woeful Pistons in London on Thursday. After that, they don't play again until a matinee matchup with the Nets on Jan. 21. Once those games are behind New York, we’ll start to get a sense of whether the Knicks are closer to the 18-5 team they once were or the sham that they’ve looked like lately — one that started a 40-year-old, a 39-year-old and some guy named James White on Friday. “We’ve got to have a sense of urgency. We’ve got to win our next couple of games,” Chandler said. “We’ve got to start a nice little winning streak. Things are never as bad as they seem, things are never as good as they seem, and we’re on a little losing streak, we’ve got guys banged up. We’ve got to find a way to turn the tide, and once we start winning, everybody will be happy again.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data
343,"Ben Wallace has made it clear that this will be his final season wearing an NBA uniform. As difficult as it is to think of not having him around any more, it’s sure nice to see Ben go out looking like the same old Ben Wallace. This is a guy who has a very legitimate chance to make the basketball Hall of Fame – as far as I’m concerned, he should make it. The way he impacted the Spurs game this week, when he set the record for games played by an undrafted player, and then came back – on a back to back and with a short night’s sleep – and had so much to do with the win in Boston the very next night speaks volumes about what he’s really all about. The way Ben finished the game on Tuesday, when he played 18 straight minutes, I’m sure some coaches would have wondered how much he had left in his tank. But Lawrence Frank has seen enough of Ben Wallace over the years from the opposing bench to really, truly believe he knows what Ben’s about and he felt comfortable playing him against the Celtics. I don’t think he was shocked to see how much Ben still had for night number two. He got 11 rebounds in that Boston game and the Pistons turned up the defense. If you’re going to finish defensive stops, you better get defensive rebounds. And that’s not all he did. He was everywhere on the court, very physical, and he really helped the Pistons pick up their defensive intensity. I know Joe Dumars knew that Ben Wallace could be a big help in turning things in the right direction this year in Lawrence Frank’s first year. I feel like Ben wanted to do one last, important thing for this final year, even though he knew after this it was off to playing with the kids and hopefully going to law school. This was an important thing for Ben – and it’s clearly been an important thing for the Pistons. We can see it on the floor. What we don’t see at the games each and every night is what Ben does in practice and what Ben does to help the younger players like Greg Monroe move on up in terms of their ability and their intensity and their basketball intelligence. Ben Wallace brings all of that to the table. When you have that much knowledge and you’re around people, they can’t help but learn something even if it’s just by osmosis. But it’s not just by osmosis, because Ben is going to make every effort every time he’s around teammates to inspire them and to educate them in the ways of winning NBA basketball. You can’t watch how hard Ben Wallace works and not go look at yourself in the mirror and think, maybe I should work a little harder. Jonas Jerebko said it best after the Spurs game when he set the record. He said it was an honor to play with him. That’s a heck of a tribute. I know Jonas truly means it. He has learned so much from Ben. Ben took one look at Jonas, with his effort and love of the game, and realized that Jonas was somebody special. Ben has really worked with him and we’ve seen the results of that. Jonas has become a very important Piston. As for me, every time I watch Ben Wallace walk onto the court this year, I know it’s a blessing. We just saw him play for the last time against Tim Duncan and the Spurs and we hearkened back to the great ’05 Finals that went seven games. When I see him play against the Boston Celtics on the parquet floor, I think of the great Pistons-Celtics matchups over the years and how much Ben has had to do with it. There are a lot of historic things going on right now and all of them have to do with Ben Wallace playing his final season in Pistons blue. It’s been an honor for me to broadcast his games all these years. I’m so glad he came back and so glad he’s given us this final season. I don’t think the excitement and his heroics are over, either. We’re going to see some great performances again this year before Ben Wallace walks away that last time.",Raw Data
344,"Premier League - Mancini slams 'worse than poor' City Eurosport - Sat, Feb 9, 2013 23:25 GMT Mancini has been under scrutiny following Manchester City's failure to make it out of their Champions League group and their inability to keep pace with Premier League leaders Manchester United, who enjoy a 12-point advantage. The Italian's future at Etihad Stadium has often been a matter for debate - particularly when Pep Guardiola's future was undecided - but Mancini says he has been the most successful manager working in England since the end of the 2010-11 season. In that campaign he won the FA Cup and then added the Premier League title last season thanks to a dramatic 3-2 win over QPR on the final day of the season. ""In the last 15 months I am the best manager in England,"" Mancini said. ""Someone says for six months that Manchester City would change manager, Guardiola would come in, and after Guardiola went to Bayern Munich, now another manager."" ""I won one Premier League, one FA Cup, one charity shield, there is not another manager that's won like me in the last 15 months."" ""I can do nothing but it is the reality."" His fellow Italian Roberto Di Matteo might have something to say about Mancini's claim though, having won both the FA Cup and the Champions League with Chelsea last summer before being sacked earlier this season.""",Raw Data
345,"Tiger Woods put the finishing touches on a season he’s calling a success with a tie for fourth at his World Challenge at Sherwood Country Club. It wasn’t his best work. Apart from a majestic 3 wood on the par-5 16th from 252 yards that set up a too little, too late eagle, the only magic he could summon on a soggy Sunday afternoon came on the greens. But because of indifferent iron play — distance control, once a staple of his arsenal, is now a mystery as wedges fly greens and elicit looks of bemused exasperation — too many of those well-holed putts were for par. And pars — or the final round, 1-under-par 71 Woods turned in — were never going to be enough to reel in Graeme McDowell, who took six more putts over four rainy days yet still clipped Woods by eight shots to win here for the second time in three years. “I struggled with my game a little bit this week,” Woods said, “I didn’t quite have it.” Historically, it hasn’t mattered if he had it or not. In 11 previous starts in one of Southern California’s most exclusive enclaves, Woods has won five times and finished runner-up four others. Dole fruit and vegetable tycoon David Murdock may hold the deed to the place, but Woods has owned Sherwood. Did he bring his A-game here in each of those wins? Of course not, but he won, anyway. This week, though, with his 37th birthday four weeks away, Woods had less the look of a champion destined for a sixth win and more that of a working stiff punching the clock one last time before a long vacation. “I need it,” he said of the six-week break he’ll be taking. “It’s been a long year, and I’ve played a lot. Really looking forward to having nothing to do with golf for a few weeks — just put (the clubs) away, enjoy the holidays, be with my kids.” It’s not to say Woods mailed this one in. He tried, as he always does. But it is to say that this World Challenge evolved like the second half of his season: He played well but not nearly well enough. Perhaps it was because there wasn’t as much at stake this year, though he could have recouped a larger chunk of the $4 million he kicked in to keep the tournament, which benefits his foundation, alive. In both 2010 and ’11, he came to these rolling hills — named Sherwood after Douglas Fairbanks shot Robin Hood here in 1922 — to show the world (and perhaps show himself) that he could win again after the scandal that changed everything. Both tournaments were important to the Woods narrative. The pesky McDowell foiled him by draining two long putts in 2010 — the sort of impolite thing Woods usually did to others. And last year, he overcame Zach Johnson to get that not-won-since-the-scandal monkey off his back. He credits last year’s World Challenge with propelling him to three wins this season. The first two of those wins — at Bay Hill and, especially at Memorial — were impressive, harbingers, it seemed, for a return to past glories. But after the third triumph, at his AT&T National at Congressional Country Club — one that owed much to Bo Van Pelt’s inability to close — Woods stalled. Lots of good (but not good enough to win) finishes. And so Woods will have plenty of fat to chew on as he heads into his offseason before returning for what may turn out to be the most important season of his career. Will he once again be golf’s king, or — as he enters a fifth winter since winning his last major — has his time passed? “I still feel I have some of my best golf to play,” Woods insisted. “In order to do that, I had to be healthy, and this year I headed in the right direction. “I'm very excited about next year.” Woods is happy to report that the major changes to his Sean Foley swing have been completed and that when he prepares for next season’s debut in Abu Dhabi — expected to be followed by an American debut at Torrey Pines — he won’t have “a laundry list” of things to work on. But though the list won’t be as long, it’s still substantial. His game’s solid, as they like to say in golf, but there’s a nagging sense of something missing. Maybe it’s technical or maybe it’s an issue of trust, but as Woods’ short game and putting improved since the summer, his ball-striking has hit a plateau. Short irons can’t find their target. And off the tee, Woods often sets up open, to play a big cut, yet pulls the shot. Meanwhile, the specter of Rory McIlroy looms, so much so that a PGA Tour media official accidentally wrote McIlroy’s name in the winner’s box on Sunday. It was interesting to hear McDowell respond when asked if he felt he could challenge his Northern Irish friend in the coming year. “I’m not quite sure if I’ve got that type of game inside me,” he admitted. “He’s on another stratosphere from everyone else right now.” For more than a decade, such lofty accolades were reserved for Woods. Will they be again?",Raw Data
346,"Ken Rosenthal has been the senior baseball writer for FOXSports.com since August 2005. He appears weekly on MLB on FOX. Follow him on Twitter. Well, the Arizona Diamondbacks are getting what they wanted, a team full of gritty dirtballs. For some broods, baseball is in the blood, like these MLB dynasties. They’ve traded center fielder Chris Young, right-hander Trevor Bauer and right fielder Justin Upton, all for questionable returns. Now let’s see if they can win a World Series with their curious emphasis on toughness over talent. Why even move Upton? That has been the question ever since the Diamondbacks started trying to trade him in November 2010. Why were the D-Backs willing to move a gifted young outfielder who was signed to an affordable long-term contract? We have our answer, now that Upton is headed to the Atlanta Braves in a seven-player trade. The answer actually is quite clear, no matter how the D-backs might try to spin this. Their actions this offseason — and not just with Upton — speak louder than any words. The Diamondbacks want a certain type of player — single-minded, outwardly intense, fierce. Cody Ross is that kind of player. Martin Prado is that kind of player. Upton, according to one of his former teammates, is not — at least not in the perception of Diamondbacks GM Kevin Towers and manager Kirk Gibson. “The problem is that he didn’t play with a high level of energy,” said the former teammate, who spoke on the condition that he would not be identified. “What I think they want is guys who play with the speed, energy and intensity of the Oregon football team — all out, all the time. “Justin doesn’t have that kind of attitude; he has a quiet intensity that doesn’t fit the mold of what KT and Gibby seem to want. He plays hard, but has to look suave doing it. Slamming into walls isn’t his thing, and they will accept nothing short of all-out sacrifice for the team.” Evidently, it wasn’t enough when Upton hit 31 home runs and finished fourth in the 2011 voting for National League MVP. Evidently, it wasn’t enough that he played through a painful injury to his left thumb in the early part of last season, helping account for his drop in production. No one questions Upton’s work ethic, but in the words of one rival executive, “he is not a leader, not an all-out hustle type.” Neither is his older brother and new teammate, center fielder B.J. Upton. Both Uptons are so talented, they can make the game look easy — too easy. Well, give me B.J.’s 25-homer, 30-stolen base ability. Give me Justin’s 40-homer, .900 OPS promise. A team won’t win with 25 Paul O’Neills slamming their helmets or 25 David Ecksteins hustling like crazy. No, a team needs difference-makers. Justin certainly is one, and he’s still only 25. B.J., 28, can be that type of player, too. One Diamondbacks player said that Justin is “ready to play every day.” Towers, in a conference call with national reporters, made reference to Upton’s on-field mannerisms and occasional swagger, acknowledging that some might not perceive that him to be the same type of grinder as say, Diamondbacks rookie center fielder Adam Eaton. But he also said that Upton “played hard each and every day.” “We never had to kick him in the rear to play,” Towers said. “He wanted to be in the lineup, even when hurt. No negatives.” Towers, though, did not dispute the perception that the Diamondbacks were trying to add “grinders,” specifically citing Prado and one of the prospects in the deal, shortstop Nick Ahmed, as players who “fit the mold.” “That’s the way Gibby played the game,” Towers said. “Look at our coaching staff, that’s the makeup of our coaching staff as well. That’s how we won (the NL West) in 2011. Justin was part of the 2011 club. “Different clubs like to look for different intangibles in players. We kind of like that grinding, gritty player – hard-nosed. I’m not saying that Justin isn’t that type of guy … ” Again, actions speak louder than words. If Upton’s style rubbed Gibson wrong, then maybe it’s Gibson who should have adjusted, or at least found some sort of middle ground. Twenty-five players, 25 personalities. They can’t all be the same. Which is not to say that chemistry is unimportant, or that this trade won’t work out well for the D-backs. Prado, 29, will be their new third baseman, and he was arguably the most popular Brave with his teammates. “Wow, I can’t believe they got rid of Prado,” one former Brave told me in a text. “Bad move.” That player knew full well whom the Braves were getting — Upton and third baseman Chris Johnson — for Prado and four prospects. The Diamondbacks knew what they were getting, too. They clearly valued Prado and Ross, whom they signed to a three-year, $26.5 million free-agent contract, over Upton and Johnson. The deal soon could look better, too, if the D-backs sign Prado long-term. The team expects to complete such a deal shortly, according to Jack Magruder of Fox Sports Arizona. Prado is eligible for free agency after this season, while Upton is signed for three more years. The trade of Upton will enable the D-backs to start Eaton in center, improving the team’s speed and defense. The pitching is good and will get better as some of the team’s top prospects reach the majors; right-hander Randall Delgado, another player the D-Backs acquired from the Braves, is the latest to join the mix. But who is the most feared hitter in the Arizona lineup now? Prado? Ross? Jason Kubel? Miguel Montero? Not good enough. “What happened to the Red Sox when Pedro, Schilling, Manny and Varitek left or declined?” one rival executive asked after learning of the trade. “You need impact guys.” Justin Upton is an impact guy. And the Diamondbacks didn’t want him.",Raw Data

348,"LIVERPOOL AGREE COUTINHO FEE In case you missed it last night, Liverpool have reportedly agreed a fee of around 8.5million for Philippe Coutinho. Reds officials have flown to Milan to finalise a deal for the Inter playmaker and the transfer should be completed by Monday. Full story here. PREM RIVALS EYE BENTEKE There hasn't been much joy at Aston Villa this season and it seems more grey clouds are gathering as several Premier League clubs eye a move for Christian Benteke. The Belgian international looked a gamble when he joined for 7.5million in the summer, but Paul Lambert's successful pursuit of the striker has proved to be the best decision the manager has made at Villa Park. However, according to The Mirror Benteke is now a target for Spurs, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City after bagging 11 goals in 25 appearances for struggling Villa this season. Spurs are thought to be leading the race for the 22-year-old, but he impressed in Villa's 3-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield and Brendan Rodgers is also listed as an admirer. Benteke is set to stay at Villa until the summer at least as he already played for two clubs this season, but the relegation battlers will struggle to hold on to their star player whose value has doubled to around 15million. READING TARGET TOM INCE According to The People, Reading are hoping to hijack Liverpool's move for Tom Ince by making an 8million bid for the winger this week. Liverpool and Blackpool have been in protracted negotiations for Ince since the start of the transfer window, with reports last week claiming that Tangerines chairman Karl Oyston is now refusing to answer the phone to the Reds. That has paved the way for Reading to sneak in, although Ince may prefer to wait until the summer to see if the Royals retain their Premier League status. Swansea are also interested in Ince, but it seems that a move to Liverpool could almost be dead with Philippe Coutinho close to joining the Reds. BEGOVIC HOPES FOR UNITED MOVE There has been plenty of talk about David De Gea's future at Old Trafford over the past week and if the Spanish youngster leaves United in the summer, Asmir Begovic is thought to be the number one candidate to replace him. The Mirror claim Begovic is desperate to join the league leaders and apparently he would turn his back on interest from Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool to make the move happen. The Mirror report: 'De Gea could be allowed to move back to Spain to either Real Madrid or Barcelona, with Begovic the top choice to replace him. 'Friends of Begovic claim the 25-year-old is particularly excited by United's interest, but he would have reservations about agreeing to move to City and starting next season on the subs' bench under Hart. 'Begovic is under contract to Stoke until 2016, and manager Tony Pulis will demand 15million for the goalkeeper he signed from Portsmouth for just 3m.' UNITED EYE NEW DEFENDER Quick line from The People now, who claim Manchester United are plotting bids for Benfica defender Ezequiel Garay and Torino centre-back Angelo Ogbonna. Argentina international Garay, who moved to Portugal from Real Madrid in 2011, would cost around 25million and apparently United scouts see him as the ideal successor to Rio Ferdinand. Ogbonna was included in Italy's Euro 2012 squad after gaining promotion with Torino last season, and it's thought United could face competition for his signature from a number of Serie A clubs.

349,"﻿It looks like Amar'e Stoudemire will miss the rest of the regular season. The only thing Knicks fans can do now is hope New York plays like the team that started the year 21-9 with Stoudemire out due to injury. It might seem harsh to ask so soon after the news of Stoudemire's latest setback with his knee, but it's worth considering: Can the Knicks be better without Stoudemire? [+] Enlarge Rick Osentoski/USA TODAY Sports The Knicks will miss the inside presence Amar'e Stoudemire provides on offense. SURE THEY CAN: Bottom line? The Knicks were one of the NBA’s hottest teams while Stoudemire rehabbed a left knee injury that kept him out of the lineup until New Year’s Day. They averaged 102.6 points per game with an average scoring differential of plus-6.1 points per game with Stoudemire out. With Stoudemire in the fold, the Knicks went 16-13, averaged 97.2 points per game and had a scoring differential of plus-2.2. Of course, it would be incorrect to correlate the 16-13 record directly to Stoudemire's presence. The Knicks suffered through several injuries (Raymond Felton's finger, Rasheed Wallace's foot) after Stoudemire returned. He also can't be held responsible for their poor outside shooting over that stretch. But with Stoudemire out, Carmelo Anthony might have the opportunity to play more minutes at power forward. Anthony -- who has missed three games with a knee problem of his own -- established himself as an early-season MVP candidate in the first two months by dominating against bigger, slower power forwards. Can he reignite the campaign with Stoudemire out? Also, it's worth wondering if the Knicks' defense improves with Kenyon Martin filling in for Stoudemire, who is widely recognized as a poor defender. NO WAY! THEY'RE BETTER WITH AMAR'E: Mike Woodson called Stoudemire's injury a ""major loss"" for the Knicks because Stoudemire is a ""big piece of the puzzle."" It might sound like coach-speak, but Woodson was speaking the truth. In 29 games this season, Stoudemire averaged 14.2 points and five rebounds in just 23.5 minutes, shooting 58 percent from the field. In recent weeks, Stoudemire had established himself as a strong low-post threat off the bench -- and that's what the Knicks might miss most. ""When you start playing playoff basketball, you need some post-up play ... [and] that's where Amar'e was so valuable for us,"" Woodson said. How do the Knicks replace that post play? Anthony is a threat with his back to the basket, but no one else on the roster can score consistently in the post. The Knicks can offset the loss of paint points with 3-pointers, but without a post player to draw the defense, it's easier for opponents to defend the perimeter. And the bench scoring will certainly take a hit with Stoudemire out. Here's something else to consider: The Knicks score 40 percent of their points in the paint when Stoudemire's on the floor. They scored just 32 percent of their points in the paint when Stoudemire's on the bench. That's an indication that his post presence will not easily be replaced and an indication that this Knicks team might not be better off without him.",Raw Data

Kris Commons smashed home a controversial late penalty to earn Celtic a 2-1 victory over Spartak Moscow, booking his team a place in the Champions League's knockout stage for the first time since 2008. The Scottish champions started the match level on points with Benfica in Group G but leapfrogged the Portuguese side, which could only draw 0-0 at Barcelona in the final round of group matches. ''The players have been magnificent - it is a monumental achievement on their behalf,'' said Celtic manager Neil Lennon, whose team beat Barcelona at home earlier in the group stage. With its match standing at 0-0 after 81 minutes, Celtic was heading out of the competition, only for Giorgos Samaras to fall easily under the challenge of Kirill Kombarov. Lennon turned away as Commons ran up for the resulting penalty, which went in off the crossbar to spark mass celebrations at Celtic Park. ''I didn't watch the penalty because I've watched our last couple and we've missed them,'' Lennon said. Already-eliminated Spartak had canceled out Gary Hooper's well-taken 21st-minute opener when Ari clipped home a lovely finish six minutes before halftime. Samaras hit the post before Commons' goal. Spartak midfielder Kim Kallstrom was sent off late on for two bookable offenses, his second resulted in Commons being taken off on a stretcher. Celtic's progression is just reward following that stunning win over Barca, having nearly beaten the Spanish giants in the Camp Nou. The tally of 10 points, three less than Barcelona, equals Rangers' record for most points gained by a Scottish team in a Champions League group. ''At home we can beat anyone - we showed that against Barca and tonight,'' Hooper said. ''We have to take it game by game.''",Raw Data

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. The medical examiner’s office said in a news release it is awaiting a decision by Seau’s family to release the deceased linebacker’s brain for study. Boston University researchers reportedly have requested an opportunity to examine Seau’s brain to further its study of the brain ailment Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Deputy medical examiner Craig Nelson conducted the autopsy, which included a full examination of Seau’s body and organs, county spokesman Sarah Gordon said in a news release. Seau was found Wednesday morning at his home in Oceanside, Calif. Medical workers called to the scene by Seau’s girlfriend failed to resuscitate him. A final report from the medical examiner — which includes lab test on tissues — could take up to 90 days to complete. Seau's ex-wife, Gina, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Seau sustained concussions during his 20-year career. She said she didn't know if the effects of concussions contributed to Seau's death. Seau's death follows the suicide last year of former Chicago Bears player Dave Duerson, who also shot himself in the chest. Duerson's family has filed a wrongful death suit against the NFL, claiming the league didn't do enough to prevent or treat concussions that severely damaged Duerson's brain before he died in in February 2011. Former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling, who had joined in a concussion-related lawsuit against the league — one of dozens filed in the past year — died last month at age 62. His wife has said he suffered from depression and dementia after taking years of hits. Seau is not known to have been a plaintiff in the concussion litigation. Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy has analyzed the brains of dozens of former athletes, including Duerson's. While saying it was saddened by Seau's death, center officials would not say if they have reached out to the Seau family or would be interested in studying his brain. ''It is our policy to not discuss any completed, ongoing or potential research cases unless at the specific request of family members,'' according to a statement released by the center. ''Our primary goal is to learn more about the long-term effects of repetitive brain trauma by conducting meaningful scientific research. At this time our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Seau's family, his many friends and former teammates.'' The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Raw Data

Lost last week in the hysteria of Manti Te’o’s bogus girlfriend experience and Oprah’s sit-down with Lance Armstrong was the report outlining the depth of Bill Hunter’s affinity for nepotism and his mom-and-pop management style of the NBA players’ association. At the behest of union president Derek Fisher, the NBPA paid $4 million for an eight-month, internal investigation that produced a 200-plus-page report that any casual observer of the players’ association could’ve summarized years ago in 10 words for one-hundredth the price tag. (1) Too. (2) Much. (3) Power. (4) And. (5) Too. (6) Long. (7) A. (8) Tenure. (9) Corrupted. (10) Hunter. Too much power and too long a tenure corrupted Hunter, the executive director of the union since 1996. A fancy-schmancy law firm bilked the NBPA out of big bucks by diagnosing a problem Stevie Wonder could see. It’s the equivalent of me hiring a personal trainer to diagnose that my butt and gut are too big. You pay big money for root causes and solutions — not the things Manti Te’o could figure out. Firing Billy Hunter won’t fix what’s wrong with the NBPA. Firing Billy Hunter and replacing him with Fisher or some NBA agent-approved lapdog won’t fix what’s wrong with the NBPA. What’s wrong with the NBPA, and what’s not addressed in the carefully crafted and manipulated, $4 million FIRE BILLY HUNTER report, is the lack of engagement in union affairs by the overwhelming majority of NBA players in general and the league’s top players in particular. Franchise success or failure often can be traced to the top. We rank the five best and five worst NBA owners. What’s wrong with the NBPA is that LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Dwight Howard, Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and countless other players who matter don’t care enough to get involved. Until the NBPA is led by an executive director with the necessary passion and intellect to push a vision strong enough to capture the engagement of James, Durant, Melo, Griffin and a handful of other in-their-prime superstars, the NBPA will always remain a toothless, dysfunctional mom-and-pop operation at best or an exploited puppet regime of power agents at worst. The previous wordy paragraph is the point of this column. I’m sorry it took me so long to get there. But Manti Te’o and Lennay Kekua botched the timing of this column, and I felt it was best to back into my main point. The NBPA is the most underachieving organization in all of sports. Yep, it’s worse than the NHL, the NHL players’ union, the Chicago Cubs and the Kardashian family Chastity Belt. If properly run, the NBPA could push basketball ahead of football at home and abroad and be the catalyst eradicating America’s despicable relationship with college football and basketball shamateurism. No group of athletes wields more power than professional basketball players, and no group does less with its power than LeBron James and Co. The blame for this rests with the players, who are immature, spoiled and distracted, and Hunter, who has never been the kind of true believer dynamic leader capable of capturing the imagination of the players he represents. Hunter took control of the NBPA at the apex of Michael Jordan’s career. In Jordan’s final two years playing for the Bulls (96-97 and 97-98), Jordan earned $30 million and $33 million a season from the Bulls. No NBA player has earned more than $28 million (Kevin Garnett 03-04) in any season since. Consider this: LeBron James has never earned more than the $17.5 million he’ll make this year in Miami. Fifteen years after Jordan left Chicago, the heir to his throne is making a little more than half the cash Jordan pocketed. Dan Marino retired in 1999. Can you think of a scenario in which Peyton Manning would be paid half as much as Marino earned in the previous century? Marino set the contract standard for elite QBs in the early 1990s (around $4 million a year) and then capped his career pulling in around $6 million a year. The Broncos paid Manning $18 million this season. Despite the ignorant ramblings of his critics, Gene Upshaw was a dynamic leader of the NFL players’ union. He connected with his base and got key players involved in the fight for salary growth and the overall growth of the league. Upshaw had a vision of how NFL players could work with NFL owners to grow the entire league and grow the pot of money they all shared. Hunter has exhibited no such vision. Years ago he got baited into a personal feud with David Stern. Hunter managed the players’ association in a way that gave him as much flexibility and autonomy as Stern. The lack of player engagement became an asset for Hunter’s fiefdom. In order to ward off threats from the power agents who desire to control the union, Hunter surrounded himself with family and yes men. Hunter should give up the fight. The scathing report lays bare his lone priority — retention of power. He’s too old to reinvent himself. Hunter should spend the next six months helping the union reorganize and identify an executive director with a vision for basketball that will inspire James, Durant, Melo and D12 to join the fight. As we saw during the labor fight last year, Derek Fisher is not that guy. I think Fish wants Hunter’s job. I can come up with no other explanation for his brief stint with the Mavericks this season. Fisher signed with the Mavs and quickly quit just to retain his position within the players union. Fisher needs to go. Chris Paul, a member of the executive committee, is the perfect person to replace Fisher as president, particularly if Paul has the balls to tell his representatives from CAA to get out of union business. The union needs an executive director who is equally suspicious of ownership and agents. The union needs an executive director who has the balls to be loyal solely to the players. Who that is? I don’t know. Ask Oscar Robertson or Bill Russell or Bill Bradley for some advice. But the union must find a basketball true believer, someone who is offended football has a higher place in the American landscape than basketball, someone who believes LeBron James and Kevin Durant should earn $40 million a season while the players on the bench still earn a good seven-figures salary. It can happen. Stern, in my opinion, surrendered the basketball-football domestic battle when the Jordan era ended and college basketball survived high school stars going straight to the NBA. Stern’s Plan B was to win the international war and make the NBA the global game of choice. Good luck taking a significant cut of soccer’s turf. Plus, everything national starts local. You can’t win abroad if you don’t win at home. The war for hearts and sports minds begins here at home. American basketball is broken. The greatness of college basketball is a media-driven hoax on the level of Lennay Kekua. College hoops enjoys tremendous passion and crowd noise. The play on the court is brutal for a variety of reasons — the top reason being the best players leave after one year and there’s little chance of top programs developing continuity because of it. The one-and-done era coupled with the previous era of players such as Kobe and KG going straight to the NBA from high school have severely damaged the marketability of NBA players. Rather than huge college stars bringing their fans with them to the NBA — the way NBA players used to and NFL players still do — most hardcore college fans hate the NBA because they blame the league for stealing their players and hurting college hoops. This needs to be fixed. It can be fixed if James, Durant and other stars get engaged in the union and work with the league in formulating a strategic plan to financially incentivize players to stay in college for three to four years. NCAA shamateurism will disappear the moment CBS hears there’s a plan in place to return the Patrick Ewings and Ralph Sampsons of the world to the NCAA Tournament in their junior and senior seasons. Trust me, there’s a way for the NBA, the NBPA and the NCAA to form some sort of convoluted limited partnership that would allow the NBA/NBPA to pay elite college players as summer interns. And there’s a way for the top college basketball programs to pay the NBA/NBPA money for leaving the top players in college for three or four years. I’m saying the NBA and college basketball could split the cost of compensating our best and brightest basketball stars while they mature and are properly marketed by Dick Vitale, Jay Bilas, Clark Kellogg and Co. I don’t want to bog this column down with every detail on how college basketball could be tweaked. But don’t be fooled into believing Title IX or some other mumbo jumbo prevents the NCAA and the NBA from working together to come up with some sort of plan that allows our best teenage basketball players to receive $100K a summer as interns and earn additional significant sums of cash that would be payable when they complete their third or fourth year of eligibility. There’s a way everyone can win — players, the NBA, college basketball, the television networks and basketball fans. An outside-the-box idea like this would have to be driven by young people inspired by a dynamic leader. It’s time for outside-the-box thinking. Stern is stepping aside in a year. Hunter should bow out along with Stern. The NBPA is the key to fixing basketball. The NBPA has to be fixed before basketball can be repaired and put in position to reach its full potential. Here are the nine players on the NBPA executive committee: Derek Fisher, Chris Paul, Keyon Dooling, Roger Mason, Matt Bonner, Maurice Evans, Etan Thomas, James Jones and Theo Ratliff. That’s not a who’s who of the NBA. That’s a who’s not. Here are the player representatives: Anthony Tolliver, Rajon Rondo, Kris Humphries, Ben Gordon, Carlos Boozer, Dahntay Jones, Andre Iguodala, Rodney Stuckey, Stephen Curry, Toney Douglas, David West, Caron Butler, Steve Blake, Mike Conley, Norris Cole, Luc Mbah A Moute, Kevin Love, Mason, Steve Novak, Nick Collison, Jameer Nelson, Damien Wilkins, Sebastian Telfair, Nolan Smith, John Salmons, Bonner, Kyle Lowry, Mo Williams and Martell Webster. No offense to this group, but it sounds like the cast from Charles Barkley’s “Who He Play For?” segment on TNT more than a group ready to force the NBA and the NCAA to embrace real change. Fire Billy Hunter. Fine. No one is going to object. If the players have a legitimate interest in improving their union, experiencing the kind of economic growth they deserve and unseating the NFL atop the American sports mountaintop, LeBron, Durant, Melo, Blake and a few others can’t leave union business in the hands of players looking to set up their next job or well-intentioned, agent-controlled players who don’t matter. If LeBron and Co. don’t want to invest and do the work, the NBPA might as well leave Billy Hunter, his kids and Derek Fisher in place. If the stars don’t engage in the process, the next internal report about the executive director will reveal just as many problems and King James will always be paid far less than his true value.",Raw Data

355,"George Rose-Getty Images Check out photos of the Lakers' legendary owner Dr. Jerry Buss. VIEW GALLERY» LOS ANGELES — With the death of Los Angeles Lakers' owner Jerry Buss at 80 on Monday morning, a prodigious era in professional sports ended. Under the leadership of Buss — who passed away after an 18-month battle with cancer — the Lakers went to the NBA Finals 16 times in 31 seasons (1979-80 to 2009-2010), winning 10 championships. It was an unprecedented period of ownership success in American pro sports history. However, Buss' larger-than-life persona came about as much from his lifestyle as it did his success as a sportsman. He owned the most glamorous franchise sports has ever seen, and Buss enjoyed the perks that went along with running a great team playing in the entertainment capital of the world. On any given night when the Lakers weren't playing, you might find Buss with a beautiful — and undoubtedly much, much younger — female companion at a restaurant or club somewhere in the Los Angeles area. Or he might be out with his group of close friends — nicknamed ""The Seven Dwarfs"" by another Buss friend, L.A. Herald Examiner sports writer Doug Krikorian. Even though Buss loved being out, he never tried to be the center of attention. That was left for others, according to Krikorian. ""Wherever we'd be, Jerry was always very low-key,"" said Krikorian, who often sat in Buss' box during games at the Forum, surrounded by the likes of Sean Connery, Hulk Hogan, Sylvester Stallone and many other celebs. ""Most of the time, he'd just sit back and enjoy the people and the atmosphere. ""Interesting thing, though, is that no matter if we were at a disco or a restaurant or a club, there was always a time when he seemed to have his mind on other things. Business things. He wasn't rude or anything like that, but you could tell that he was focused on something other than partying. ""He was like a lot of successful businessmen I knew who spent a lot of their time occupied by business."" Krikorian also talked about Buss' penchant for dating younger women, and the criticisms that went along with it. ""Yeah,"" Krikorian said with a laugh, ""Jerry always had a beautiful woman with him. I thought it was great. It never bothered me. But you'd hear the remarks from some people criticizing him for going out with women younger than his daughters, and it was ridiculous. They were upset about it, I think, just because they were jealous. ""What people should understand is that he never let his lifestyle get in the way of business. He was a brilliant guy and he was very shrewd in business. ""He was smart enough to know that he didn't understand basketball like Jerry West did, so he let West run the basketball operations and basically stayed out of the way. Unlike some of the egomaniacs that own teams and think they know it all, Buss trusted his people to make the right decision. And it led to the greatest period in L.A. sports history."" Bottom line is that no matter his lifestyle or notoriety, Buss was just a down-to-earth good guy who was loyal to his friends, said Krikorian. ""When the Herald Examiner went out of business in November of 1989,"" Krikorian recalled, ""I got a call from Buss' aide-de-camp Bob Steiner, saying that Jerry was concerned and that if I needed a job, he'd give me one. ""That's the Jerry Buss I knew."" The Jerry Buss I knew was a bit different from the man who often partied with Krikorian and his buddies. But it always was a special time when he was around. On the rare occasions he wasn't with a date or the Dwarfs, he'd hang out with reporters in the Forum press lounge after games. When we were done filing our stories, the drinks and tales would start flowing, and those nights would end early the next morning after hours of very competitive trivia contests. Trust me, there aren't many — if any — team owners who would do that. Let alone do it a few times every season. Jerry Buss is gone, but for any Laker fan who has lived in Los Angeles over the past 33 years, he will never be forgotten. He crushed the odds and brought championships and joy to one of the most demanding fan bases in the United States. He was a very unique man who lived a life most can only dream about. And whose lasting impact can be summed up in one word: winner.",Raw Data
356,"Hey, it's not every day the Wildcats knock off a top five team — though they sure are trying. Arcidiacono hit the tying 3-pointer with 2.2 seconds left in regulation, and James Bell hit consecutive 3s in overtime to send Villanova to its second win over a top five team this week, 75-71 over No. 3 Syracuse on Saturday. The Wildcats defeated No. 5 Louisville 73-64 on Tuesday and became the first unranked team to beat two top five teams in the same season since Florida State in 2011-12, according to STATS LLC. ''What a week for us,'' coach Jay Wright said. What an understatement. Philadelphia's college fans came down with a case of court-storming fever this week after Villanova's win over Louisville and La Salle's 54-53 win the next night over No. 9 Butler. At the Wells Fargo Center, home of the NHL's Flyers, the fans made it a Philly hoops hat trick, rushing the court in celebration of perhaps the biggest regular-season week in Villanova history. Talk about upset city! Arcidiacono's 3-point attempt to tie with about 25 seconds left in regulation was off the mark. Syracuse's Michael Carter-Williams missed the front end of a 1-and-1 and JayVaughn Pinkston of the Wildcats grabbed the rebound. Bell missed a 3 and Mouphtaou Yarou grabbed the offensive rebound. Syracuse decided not to foul, giving Yarou time to kick it out to Arcidiacono. He let go a leaner from just beyond the 3-point line to tie the game at 61, force overtime and send the crowd of 18,273 into a frenzy. ''I just put it up and luckily it went in,'' Arcidiacono said. ''I think we're having fun.'' Whether it's the history of Allen Fieldhouse or the frenzy of Cameron Indoor, college basketball boasts many distinctive arenas. Did your team's home court make the list? The Wildcats may not be ranked in next week's AP Top 25 poll, but they have worked their way into NCAA tournament discussion. The next time Villanova wins a big one, fans can stay seated. ''It was fun, but, hopefully people know we don't need that anymore,'' Arcidiacono said. With the Orange (18-2, 6-1 Big East) down two points in overtime, Brandon Triche made one free throw with 46.5 seconds left. Bell followed with a layup to for a 71-68 lead and the Wildcats (13-7, 4-3) held on from the free throw line. Darrun Hilliard scored 25 points had six assists and no turnovers in 38 minutes. Yarou had 14 points and 16 rebounds for the Wildcats while Bell scored 13 points. The Wildcats committed only one turnover in the final 14 minutes. Yes, this is the same team that lost consecutive games to Alabama, Columbia and La Salle in November. There's no break on the schedule: Villanova plays Wednesday at No. 24 Notre Dame. ''It takes time to build a team,'' Wright said. ''That's what we're doing here. We're building a team.'' Florida State beat No. 3 North Carolina and No. 4 Duke in its big week. Triche led the Orange with 23 points and Carter-Williams scored 17 points. The Orange had an eight-game winning streak and both of their losses came to Philadelphia teams. They lost to Temple on Dec. 22. ''We missed a lot more layups than we have all year,'' coach Jim Boeheim said. ''That's part of the game.'' The Orange clearly could have use James Southerland in the tight game. Southerland, second on the team in scoring at 13.6 points and the team leader with 33 3-pointers, was declared out indefinitely because of an eligibility matter involving academics that has yet to be resolved. Jerami Grant, who played well in Southerland's absence, hit a 3-pointer early in the second half that gave the Orange their first lead of the game, 33-32. Grant fouled out with 5:22 left and the Orange up one. His fifth foul was against Hilliard. Hilliard missed both from the line, the Orange stormed down in transition off the defensive board, and Triche hit a 3 for a 57-53 lead. The Orange just could never put them away. They missed six of eight shots in overtime and were only 5 of 14 overall from 3-point range. ''We played good D but their point guard just made a good shot to send it to overtime,'' forward C.J. Fair said. ''I knew we had a shot at coming back and winning this game. It just didn't bounce our way.'' The Wildcats gave all the students standing behind each basket and dressed in white an early reason to think they would be rushing again. They opened the game on a 10-0 run and stretched the lead to 25-13. But the fun didn't last long. Triche, a 50-percent shooter on the season, hit Syracuse's first 3-pointer of the half to slice the lead to four. He tipped in a basket at the buzzer to cut the lead to 32-26. The next buzzer beater to end a half, Villanova was ready. ''We can't let this be our season,'' Hilliard said.",Raw Data
357,"The Los Angeles Sparks signed guard Kristi Toliver to a multi-year deal coming off a season in which she was chosen the WNBA's most improved player. The contract was announced Wednesday. Toliver has averaged 12.4 points, 3.0 assists and 2.5 rebounds in three seasons with the Sparks. She won the league's award after posting team and career-highs in points (17.5), assists (4.9), rebounds (3.2) and minutes (31.5) while starting 33 of 34 games last season. She also had career-highs in steals (1.3) and field-goal percentage (.491) and was named to the All-WNBA second team while helping the Sparks return to the playoffs. Toliver has improved in points and steals every year since joining the league in 2009.",Raw Data
358,"It's fair to say that this has been a busy week at St James' Park. Newcastle have signed four players in as many days in an effort to stave off an impending battle against relegation. All four players were purchased from Ligue Un, adding to the meaningful French contingent already at the club. This is now composed of ten players qualified to play for France, with another four who were born in French-speaking countries. That's quite a haul. After the vomit-inducing Twitter 'jokes' regarding Newcastle playing in the French home shirt and the English players having to become learned in the Gallic tongue have died down, such a policy does raise an interesting question of identity within the club and its relationship with the town and supporters. Have Newcastle sold their soul over the channel? Firstly, the logic. Newcastle were in desperate need of recruits as they entered the January transfer window. Injuries had laid bare a squad that had become effectively strangled by the successes of last season. Europa League football has taken its toll, and the media has consistently fed the line that the club are now in a worse position than their relegated squad of 2008/9. The only Newcastle players that could be said to have improved on last season are Sylvain Marveaux and Davide Santon, and even the latter's performances have suffered lately. In addition, January has brought its own headaches. Top scorer Demba Ba left for Chelsea, the fee gained markedly less than the striker's worth to Newcastle. At the time of his departure, Ba had scored 13 Premier League goals; the rest of the Newcastle team had the same number between them. Add to that the continuous rumour and counter-rumour regarding the desire of club captain (and best defender) Fabricio Coloccini to return home to Argentina (the club have announced his stay until the summer), and the departure of Cheick Tiote to the African Cup of Nations and Newcastle's need for recruitment was clear. Fans urged owner Mike Ashley to invest. And invest he has. Mathieu Debuchy has been signed as a first-team replacement for Danny Simpson, Massaido Haidara (at only 20) is cover for Davide Santon, Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa will usurp Mike Williamson in central defence, Moussa Sissoko is an all-action midfielder and Yoan Gouffran can play out wide, perhaps allowing Hatem Ben Arfa to operate in a more central role behind Papiss Cisse. With all players fit, the depth of Newcastle's squad now looks far more secure. Newcastle evidently have one of the Premier League's strongest scouting networks, and the club have continued to work on the 'if it ain't broke' principle, with Graham Carr seemingly given carte blanche in transfer selection. The club's top performers in recent times have been purchased from France, so why stop? Moreover, the value for money makes such deals virtual no-brainers, perhaps best summed up by the following equation: Debuchy + Yanga-Mbiwa + Cabaye + Ben Arfa + Tiote + Cisse = Andy Carroll I accept the rather simple nature of the maths, but you get the point. Why would Newcastle look elsewhere for their talent when they have a resource seemingly open to being tapped (and I'm making no transfer accusations with that last word)? Since summer 2011 Newcastle have bought eight international footballers for a touch over 43million. That's less than they received for Kevin Nolan, Fraser Forster, Andy Carroll and Leon Best. This isn't so much a policy as common sense. But what of the club's identity? Have Newcastle's owners and scouting department lost a sense of what the club should be? Don't be foolish. Firstly, if having a multitude of foreigners at a club forces this abstract idea of identity to be lost, then complaints are long overdue. On Boxing Day 1999, Gianluca Vialli became the first ever manager to pick a team entirely of foreign players. The Chelsea team that day read Holland, Spain, Brazil, France, Nigeria, Romania, France, Uruguay, Italy, Italy, Norway - a cosmopolitan affair in a league that embraced such an influx. Foreign recruitment on an industrial scale is also not unique. Shakhtar Donetsk have nine Brazilians, SK Lierse of Belgium have eight Egyptians and FC Cluj have nine Portuguese players in their squad. When a club such as Watford can have 17 different nationalities I think we can deduce that the ship has sailed. The fact is that whilst a born Geordie may have an underlying connection and affinity to the city, and the Ameobis and Steven Taylor remain to provide that (substitute) core, a French player will have no less kinship with the club and city than a player from London or Cardiff. The idea that a club needs homegrown players to allow supporters to affiliate sufficiently is a completely out-dated notion. Manchester City fans would rank Pablo Zabaleta and Vincent Kompany high amongst their most loyal and committed players, Manchester United supporters will forever praise the attitude of Peter Schmeichel, Nemanja Vidic and Roy Keane and if Arsenal were picking three players that defined the club's Premier League era, England's Tony Adams would surely be joined by France's Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry. The identity of a club is not built in its players, nor in its owners (11 of the 20 in the Premier League are foreign) or managers (Newcastle have one of the English three). These are mere transients. The identity of a club is in the constant and the eternal, leaving just the fan base, those that love their city as they love their club. As long as players show professionalism, pride and honesty, there will be no more questions. Ask Newcastle fans whether they were proud of their squad that contained 11 Englishmen and were relegated in 2008/9, and you will have your answer. Newcastle's business in this window has been hugely impressive, and fans would rather see 11 different nationalities playing Premier League football than 11 Geordies in the Championship. Therein lies the answer.",Raw Data
359,"Bears spoil KU's Big 12 title Rockets fire on all cylinders in win over Nets James Harden scored 29 points to lead the Rockets to a 119-106 win over the Nets on Saturday night. (Pat Sullivan/Associated Press) Thomas Campbell-USA TODAY Sports Check out the Rockets Power Dancers and more. VIEW GALLERY » HOUSTON -- The Houston Rockets are an average team, but they are average in the most tantalizing way. The Rockets never play an average game. They either play great, or they play terribly. Seems like either the Rockets are drilling 3s all night or the other team is. This, perhaps, is an unintended consequence of the way they play. The Rockets like to get out wide and push the pedal to the floor, and sometimes when you do that, you spin out. Saturday night, the Rockets had the motor rapped out and the transmission in overdrive. Deron Williams scored 20 points in the first quarter for the Brooklyn Nets, but it hardly mattered. The Nets were going to need a lot more than that. By the time Williams made another basket, the third quarter was halfway over and the Rockets led by 18. Houston (24-22) ended up beating the Nets (26-18), 119-106, at Toyota Center. ""It's how we need to play,"" Rockets coach Kevin McHale said. ""You got to be determined to do it. You got to be determined when you're tired. … You got to keep pushing."" This was especially true Saturday because, these being the Rockets, who allow a shade under 103 points per game, the game was hardly over with an 18-point spread in the third quarter. But this was one of the Rockets' good nights. All-Star James Harden was doing James Harden things, which is to say he was getting to the foul line with that rangy eurostep of his. But that's a given. Harden averages 26 points, and he's almost always good for it. He has failed to score 20 only eight times this season. The ebbs and flows for Houston have more to do with the role players. Jeremy Lin averages 12 points and six assists. He had 14 and nine on Saturday. Omer Asik averages 10 points and 10 rebounds, but got 20 and 16. Chandler Parsons had 14 points and 11 assists. Marcus Morris had five offensive rebounds. Houston out-rebounded the Nets 50-31 and had 31 assists on 43 field goals. ""The last two games, we've played harder, played with passion,"" Rockets swingman Chandler Parsons said. ""It's been really fun the last two games."" It was important for the Rockets to have one of their good nights, because they had been on an awfully reckless path lately. They had lost eight of their last 10 games, with the two wins coming over the Charlotte Bobcats (10-32) and New Orleans Hornets (14-29), a pair of victories that count the same as any others in standings but perhaps not in the Rockets' hearts. Houston needed to beat somebody good, and Brooklyn qualified. The Nets entered Saturday's game No. 2 in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. It appeared, at first, that it was going to be another torturous night for Lin. The residue from Linsanity still seems to inspire some opponents to put him in his place, and Williams was a great candidate for such a reminder. He was the victim of Lin's first breakout game with the Knicks last year. Lin had 25 points and seven assists against Williams and the Nets, and this established Williams as an antagonist in Lin's ongoing narrative. The next time they met, Williams scored 38. This was meeting No. 3. Williams was headed for 80 after the first quarter but stopped shooting for a while and finished with 27 points and 11 assists. But the Nets aren't accustomed to playing at Houston's pace – Houston is the fastest team in the NBA and Brooklyn the slowest – and Williams was the only one up for it. The Nets got the deficit under 10, but that was about as hard as they could push. Williams left without talking to the media, which may have had something to do with this: With 1:07 left, Williams got ejected for something he said to a referee. Finally, someone else had spun out. Thursday, the Rockets had a film session in which they reviewed some of their better performances from this season. It was kind of a reminder. ""I think we got away from that,"" Parsons said. ""It was good for us to see how easy it looked.""",Raw Data
360,"Woods has won seven times — including, most famously, the 2008 US Open — on this scenic muni cut into the San Diego bluffs over the Pacific Ocean. Starting in 2005, he won five straight starts here, culminating with that 14th major, claimed heroically on one good leg. More important, winning at Torrey Pines set the tone for in each of those years for Woods, who won 25 times in that four-year span. “Torrey was always a tournament that I thought was the most important of the year for Tiger,” says his former coach, Hank Haney. “He talks a lot about momentum, and a good start to the year always gave him the momentum he wanted. Tiger won at Torrey every time that he played there while I helped him.” Torrey Pines isn’t just a layout that, in Woods-speak “fits my eye” — like Firestone or Bay Hill or Augusta National or even Muirfield Village — but a place that holds an almost spiritual place in the Tiger lore. It was here where his late father, Earl, brought him as a boy to watch the pros and where he told him that one day, if he was good enough, he’d bring him to play. An improper drop results in a penalty for Tiger Woods, who misses the cut at Abu Dhabi. “Torrey Pines is a very special place to me,” Woods wrote in a 2011 email. “It’s a place my Pop took me to watch golf, and it’s a course that we later played often together. “I think of my Pop every day, but I have very distinct memories here.” For a variety of reasons — scandal, injury and, last year, the lure of petro-dollars in the Middle East — Woods has been back only once since the 2008 Open. In 2011, he opened his PGA Tour season at the Farmers Insurance Open but, after a promising start, faded over the final 45 holes to finish in a tie for 44th — the only time in 13 starts he has finished outside the top 10 in this event. On Thursday, he opens his US season at Torrey Pines again, but with perhaps more on the line than ever before. If Woods is to ever reclaim his status as golf’s most dominant force — and that’s far from certain — that evolution needs to start somewhere. What better place than Torrey Pines? “I agree,” says Haney, “This year is it for Tiger for many reasons.” For Tiger, 2013 is a pivotal season in his career because there really are no excuses left: Woods has had 2-1/2 years to get in the “reps” with instructor Sean Foley, to get adjusted to life as a divorced father of two. And he is, by his own admission, injury-free. “It's nice to be healthy to be able to train and practice and do all of the things that I know I can do. It's definitely a very different feeling, so it's nice to be back,” Woods said Tuesday at his pre-tournament press conference. All that’s left then is for Woods to make a statement and show that, at 37, he is on his way back. Because last week’s season debut in Abu Dhabi showed anything but. Although much was made of the two-shot penalty he incurred for taking an incorrect drop, it was hardly the reason he missed the cut. A sharp short game masked many problems, especially off the tee, where Woods found only 11 of 28 fairways. Truth is, he didn’t look prepared, which, according to Haney, has been a problem with Woods dating back to 2007. That when, Haney says, he noticed a drop-off in work rate. That is, perhaps, understandable given that it was always unlikely a child prodigy wouldn’t discover at some point that there are other things in life outside of golf. But if Woods wants to get back to the top of the mountain, he won’t get there as a dilettante. Starting with world No. 1 Rory McIlroy, there are just too many good players now for Woods to overcome without something approaching his A-game. “Each generation, it gets a little more difficult,” Woods acknowledged on Tuesday. “You have more guys going into a weekend with a chance to win, and they are. They can win from anyplace. The gap's gotten smaller, in that regard.” And so has his window to get to the only mark that really matters to Woods: eclipsing Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18 majors. Some will say he already has begun his trek, pointing to his three wins last year. And there’s an element of truth to that, but last year also revealed a new fragility to Woods. He crumbled on the weekends at the year’s final three majors. A Woods’ confidante, John Cook, had an interesting response to GolfWorld magazine when he was asked whether Woods choked. “Why do you choke? Because you don't have real trust in what you're doing,” he said. “Well, he does now. “[2012] was getting back to winning, but [this] year, it's statement time.” Yes, it is. “Especially after missing the cut at Abu Dhabi, this week at Torrey takes on added importance,” Haney says. “If Tiger is going to have the year he expects, it will start with a win this week at Torrey.”",Raw Data
361,"LOS ANGELES -- A case could be made that the other basketball team in Los Angeles, the one that did not rock the NBA with its blockbuster deals last summer, did not blow out its coach five games into the season, and does not generally operate as if it exists under a big top, is actually the one worth watching. No, really watching. The Lakers are masters at collecting talent, headlines -- and in past iterations, championships -- but watching them play sometimes can require effort. Watch the Clippers, on the other hand, and you never know what you might see. Jamal Crawford, the newly acquired sixth man, is well on his way to compiling a mix tape of defenders he has clowned -- making Rudy Gay fall down, turning Metta World Peace inside and out, and nutmegging Nando De Colo. When DeAndre Jordan threw down a one-handed rebound dunk, he jumped so high that his foot clipped the net as he began to fall. Then on Wednesday night, Eric Bledsoe, the defensive dynamo of a guard, blocked a dunk attempt by Dwyane Wade by meeting him at the rim, an achievement that earned him a subtle pat on the behind from Wade. And surely at some point this season, Blake Griffin is bound to deliver a highlight dunk of his own, one that perhaps -- like his slam over Kendrick Perkins -- might not only be a posterizing dunk but one that spawns its own T-shirt. Yet for all this flash, the Clippers at times still look suspiciously like a team that is more style than substance. This is so even though their impressive start to the season continued with a 107-100 victory over the Heat, who looked like many defending champions look in November -- like they can't wait for April. LeBron James played again like a MVP, but Wade and Chris Bosh, who begged out of the Olympics because they needed rest and minor surgery, still looked weary, combining to make just 5 of 23 shots. Nevertheless, the Clippers have begun the season beating Miami, Memphis, the Lakers and San Antonio, lending an air of legitimacy to their push to be included amongst NBA title contenders. And yet watching them play, it's easy to wonder how this is going to play in the end, especially when watching the ball in the hands of the mesmerizing Crawford, who once again carried the scoring load for Los Angeles with 22 points on 7 of 11 shooting. Crawford is a thrill to watch, the way he dribbles the ball between his legs -- and others in the case of De Colo -- and turns defenders around. Ray Allen, who might have taken his spot with the Clippers but canceled his visit when he decided to join the Heat, looked like he had aged 10 years trying to guard Crawford. Allen looked hopeless -- and often over his shoulder -- as he waited (pleaded?) for help. But Crawford's play also looked like it was meant for Rucker Park, and as surely as he helped shoot the Clippers into a huge lead -- a couple of poor decisions, launching a 28-footer and traveling, nearly gave Miami life down the stretch. ""Jamal played great,"" Miami forward Shane Battier said. ""He hit a bunch of shots that when you draw them up, you hope guys take them. If he hits them, you tip your cap and move on. They were spectacular shots. As a defender, they're shots you don't mind a guy taking."" Crawford would do well to watch and learn from Chris Paul, who made the little plays most of the game -- controlling the pace, handing out 10 assists and notching four steals. But he also turned the game late in the third quarter with a pair of 3-pointers over his good friend James, and then getting to the line for a pair of free throws. Suddenly, the Clippers, locked in a taught game, owned a 10-point lead. ""CP3 is the guy that stirs the drink,"" Battier said. In some ways, the Clippers are following in Miami's steps -- albeit with down-sized expectations. Just as James transformed what was possible for the Heat, Paul has done the same for the Clippers. Now, that the Clippers core -- Paul, Griffin, Bledsoe, Jordan and the still injured Chauncey Billups -- is back for a second season, the increased familiarity and the abrupt end of last season with a second-round sweep by San Antonio might provide the requisite experience and motivation. ""The big thing for us was just learning our game, and learning each other a little more and being more confident as a group,"" Wade said. ""We wanted it. We came off losing in the championship and even though it was a shortened season, we came back with the mindset that no matter what we want to put ourselves in the position of getting back to the Finals."" The Clippers believe they have upgraded their bench enough to follow suit -- and certainly Crawford adds a more dynamic scorer off the bench than Mo Williams. Ryan Hollins and Matt Barnes have brought energy and bite, enough to table concerns for now about whether Lamar Odom will be able to work himself into a contributing role. ""Top to bottom, this team is more talented than the one we had in Boston,"" said Hollins, a reserve for the Celtics when they lost to Miami in last season's seven-game Eastern Conference finals. ""But we're missing the little things right now."" In the coming months, especially for a team that has played just one game away from Los Angeles, there will be challenges ahead and then the playoffs. For the Clippers, it's likely to be those little things, the simple rather than the spectacular, which ultimately define where it ends.",Raw Data
362,"Fortunately for the Wildcats, they still have plenty of time to prove they'll be a factor in the Big 12. Will Clyburn had 24 points and 10 rebounds, and Iowa State beat No. 11 Kansas State 73-67 on Saturday to hand the Wildcats their second straight loss after a 15-2 start. Freshman Georges Niang added 15 points for the Cyclones (14-5, 4-2 Big 12), who beat a ranked opponent for the first time this season. ''Now we had a reality smack,'' Kansas State coach Bruce Weber said. ''We've got to get back to where we were and do the things that we did well to give us a chance.'' Kansas State did just that in the second half, shooting 64 percent and answering basket after basket by Iowa State. The Wildcats simply ran out of chances. Rodney McGruder broke free for a dunk to get the Wildcats within 70-67 with 48.5 seconds left, but Korie Lucious answered with a layup to make it a two-score game with 20 seconds to go. Will Spradlin had 15 points and McGruder scored 13 to lead the Wildcats (15-4, 4-2), who lost on the road for the first time in four games. ''The things that made us good for most of the season is that we guarded and out-toughed and outplayed people,'' Weber said, adding that Iowa State ''made more determined plays when it counted.'' Kansas State's eight-game winning streak was stopped Wednesday by No. 3 Kansas, which won 59-55 for its 23rd victory in 25 tries at Bramlage Coliseum. The Wildcats are now on their first losing streak of the season. Iowa State finally got some breathing room with 5:24 left as Clyburn found Lucious, who stopped under the basket and flipped the ball back to Melvin Ejim for a two-handed stuff that put the Cyclones ahead 63-56. Clyburn then beat three Kansas State defenders for a rebound on the wing, and Niang turned it into a 3-pointer that made it 68-62 with 2:35 left. Lucious had 10 points and eight assists a day after calling a players-only meeting to rally the Cyclones, who were 11 of 22 from 3-point range. ''We could never really get enough momentum to change the game,'' Weber said. ''When you go 11 from 22 from the 3 it's probably a difference maker. And yet, throughout the whole thing we're right there.'' Iowa State had an impressive start to Big 12 play, rattling off wins over Texas, West Virginia and TCU after nearly beating Kansas in Lawrence in the league opener. But the Cyclones had their momentum stunted by Texas Tech, which on Wednesday handed them their first bad loss, 56-51. Iowa State responded by being the aggressor early against the Wildcats. The Cyclones went on a 10-0 run capped by a nifty, underhand scoop from Niang to go up 24-15. But Kansas State rallied, moving back in front 27-26 at halftime in large part because Iowa State was just 3 of 10 from the free throw line. The teams went back and forth for much of the second half, as the Wildcats kept Iowa State from building anything more than a slim advantage until the final minute. Free throws were a factor as well. The Cyclones were 10 of 22 from the line and Kansas State was 4 of 9. ''I challenged our guys. I said, `Fellas, we are scoring every time down the floor. We've got to find a way to get stops and string them together,''' Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg said. ''The last 4 minutes I thought we did a much better job of finding a way to get stops.'' Kansas State entered play ranked seventh in the nation in 3-point field goal percentage defense, while the Cyclones were sixth in the country with 9 made 3s per game. Iowa State got the better of the Wildcats as far as 3s went and withstood a number of impressive responses by Kansas State. ''We were big on focus,'' Niang said. ''We came back and practice was real tough the last two days. We got after each other.'' Shane Southwell had 11 points for Kansas State, which lost despite shooting 50.9 percent from the field. ''We'll be fine. We'll be fine. We're going to compete at a high level,'' Southwell said.",Raw Data

364,"Paris Saint-Germain needed a fortuitous own goal from center back Aurelien Chedjou to earn a 1-0 win against Lille on Sunday and move back to the top of the French league. Lille had what seemed to be a legitimate goal from forward Ronny Rodelin ruled out late in the first half as PSG struggled to create chances. PSG failed to get going in the second half, but scored in the 68th when goalkeeper Steeve Elana palmed away a cross and the ball bounced back off Chedjou's chest and went in. ''I don't have any regrets concerning the way my players played,'' Lille coach Rudi Garcia said, lamenting Lille's disallowed goal. ''I won't go on about it but I don't think PSG needs this kind of thing to win. If we'd opened the scoring I don't think it would have been the same match.'' Substitute Tulio De Melo struck the post shortly after as Lille went close to equalizing, but PSG held on to move ahead of Lyon on goal difference, with both teams locked on 45 points after 22 matches. After top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic scuffed his shot and gave Elana an easy save, PSG then got a reprieve when Rodelin headed in from a corner in the 37th but the linesman disallowed it, even though replays showed there was no offside - as left back Maxwell was covering Nolan Roux - and no foul in the buildup to the goal. PSG went straight up the other end and Ibrahimovic hit a powerful first-time shot from 25 yards which hit the post. PSG had to wait until the 61st for another scoring chance, only for Lille center half Marko Basa to move swiftly across and block winger Ezequiel Lavezzi's shot. Lille almost equalized in the 73rd when Rodelin picked out Dimitri Payet in the penalty area and his first-time shot was too close to goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who managed to push it away. De Melo then struck the inside of the post after Payet had set him up as PSG survived another lucky escape. ''We had some luck in this game. A lot of times you don't have any so we're happy to take the three points,'' PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti said. ''You can't always play great football, but the essential thing is to stay solid and win. It's true that we didn't play well, but we managed to beat a good team. The players have won nine out of the past 10 matches, so I take my hat off to them.'' Although PSG's expensively assembled team has yet to show the attacking spark its fans so crave, the defense remains solid, and Sirigu set a new club record after his eighth consecutive league game without conceding a goal. Sirigu has kept a clean sheet for 775 minutes and surpassed Bernard Lama's PSG record of 697 minutes. ''It was difficult right until the end, that's what football is about and makes this sport great,'' Sirigu said. ''I'd heard about the record, people spoke to me about it during the week, but I didn't want to think about it too much and put myself under pressure.'' Earlier, forward Henri Saivet scored the winning goal as Bordeaux won 1-0 at Nice to move above its rival on goal difference and into fifth place, and Saint-Etienne beat Bastia 3-0 to climb up to seventh spot. Former champion Lille is in 11th place. Saivet struck in the 58th minute, controlling Jaroslav Plasil's pass and firing a quick shot inside the front post. Neal Maupay, Nice's 16-year-old striker, almost equalized in the 64th when he clipped the ball over goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso but saw his effort bounce back off the crossbar and cleared by Bordeaux's defense. ''We came up against a solid team. They tackled well and were tactically disciplined and stopped us developing our game,'' Nice coach Claude Puel said. ''We put in a lot of effort in the first half and maybe we paid for it in the second. Perhaps a draw was a fairer result given that we only made one mistake and conceded only one chance. It's a shame.'' Earlier, striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ended his 12-game scoring drought as Saint-Etienne beat Bastia 3-0 to move up to seventh spot. The 23-year-old Aubameyang had not scored since Nov. 10 and he wrapped up the victory when he scored the second goal after Brazilian striker Brandao had given Saint-Etienne an early lead. Midfielder Joshua Guilavogui added a third late on for the home side. Brandao struck in the eighth minute, turning in Fabien Lemoine's cross from the right as Bastia's defense failed to clear the ball properly, and Aubameyang made it 2-0 in the 79th as he ran onto Guilavogui's pass behind the defense and finished confidently. Aubameyang returned the favor when he set up Guilavogui to complete the scoring in the 85th. ''Obviously it's annoying not to score for so long. But I'm happy tonight,'' Aubameyang said. ''That goal is for everyone who doubted me.''",Raw Data

Check out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo. Stoudemire, who had been playing well off the bench, will have the procedure to remove tissue within the week, the Knicks said Saturday before their game against the Utah Jazz. Stoudemire missed the first 30 games after having the same surgery, called a debridement, on his left knee during the preseason. He returned on New Year's Day and has averaged 14.2 points in 29 games as a reserve. ''I feel for the young man because he put so much time and hard work in, but we've got to go on,'' Knicks coach Mike Woodson said. The Knicks were also without Carmelo Anthony, sitting out his third straight game with a sore and stiff right knee. But the Stoudemire news was a surprise, since there was no indication there had been any problem with his surgically repaired knees until Saturday morning. Stoudemire didn't take part in the Knicks' morning shootaround, and had an MRI later in the day. Leading the Brooklyn Nets by 2 1/2 games entering play Saturday, the Knicks have to hope Stoudemire can return for the playoffs. ''It's a loss, a major loss, to what we're trying to do, but you know we're going to have to wait on him and continue our climb,'' Woodson said. ''We can't sit and sulk and feel sad and upset about it. It's what it is and guys have got to step up and play.'' FAN ROYALTY Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. Stoudemire has a history of knee injuries that made the $100 million contract he signed in 2010 uninsurable. The Knicks were being especially careful since his latest surgery, keeping him on a minutes restriction that started in the low 20s and had recently grown to 30 minutes a night. And once Anthony was hurt, the Knicks had no choice but to use Stoudemire right to - and even over - that limit. He played 32 minutes Monday in Cleveland, the game in which Anthony was injured, and went 31 minutes two nights later in a victory over Detroit, tying his season high with 22 points in each game. He scored 16 points Thursday in a loss to Oklahoma City, playing 29 minutes and even throwing down an impressive dunk over Thunder defensive star Serge Ibaka. So even the Knicks were surprised to learn they would be without him again. ''Not what we expected to hear, that's for sure,'' forward Steve Novak said. ''It was like he was out there getting buckets, dunking on guys a day ago, and he's hurt, so I feel bad for him. I think that the way he was playing, his confidence was high, and you just don't want to see him get hurt again.'' Though his main injury last season was his back, Stoudemire has battled knee injuries throughout his career. The Knicks originally said he would be out two to three weeks with a ruptured cyst in his left knee during the preseason, but that became a lengthy absence for surgery. THE RIGHT MOVES See how NBA dance teams get crowds all fired up. The Knicks already lost another reserve forward, Rasheed Wallace, likely for the remainder of the regular season because of foot surgery. Marcus Camby has been injury-prone, so Stoudemire's injury could open additional time for Kenyon Martin, who just signed with the Knicks last month after sitting out all season. They are calling Anthony day to day. He received more treatment Saturday and it is unclear if he will play on their upcoming road trip, which includes what would be his first trip back to Denver since the Nuggets traded him to the Knicks in February 2011.",Raw Data
366,"Somewhere in the muddle and mistakes and missed chances marking Royce White's growing schism between himself and the team that believed in him despite glaring red flags is a more common challenge facing NBA organizations. As White spews on his Twitter timeline his personal struggles and enmity toward the Rockets, who suspended him this week for failing to report to his D-League assignment after a protracted standoff over his social anxiety disorder and refusal to play, the league is left to ponder the most difficult question in sports. How, exactly, do you assess players as both on-the-court assets and off-the-court human beings? There are variables in the numbers, but there are variables in the human experience, too, and those can be just as tricky to project. Properly parsing and understanding all of this data, quantitative and qualitative, separates great general managers from everyone else. In White, you have the ultimate paradox: He was an analytics godsend, a 6-foot-8, 260-pound basketball specimen with numbers that when properly decoded foretold a remarkable future. And he was clearly a troubled young man with a well-documented difficulty in overcoming his mental illness enough to use that God-given talent. So what to do? See in White that obvious statistical promise that foretells basketball greatness, or see in White the obvious human struggles that foretell something else entirely? Houston went with the numbers. When the Rockets drafted White this past summer, they did not yet know James Harden would be available to them. So they took what the numbers said was a high-end lottery pick at what, at least on paper, looked like a steal. On a very basic level, in his final college season White had a player efficiency rating of about 23, depending on which PER you choose to look at. By that methodology White was the seventh most-talented player taken when Houston nabbed him with that 16th pick ahead in the PER of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (drafted second), Bradley Beal (third), Harrison Barnes (seventh), Andre Drummond (ninth) and Austin Rivers (10th), among others. Before dismissing that tool out of hand, know that of the four-highest PERs, only one player could be described as a bust. Anthony Davis (35.1), Damian Lillard (34) and Dion Waiters (26.3) all look like solid draft picks. Thomas Robinson (27.4) does not. There is a deep philosophical divide here, between White and his team and between those who believe the numbers hold the ultimate key to the NBA's talent puzzle and those who approach them more cautiously. The divide is deep enough in this case that White will not have the chance for at least another year to try his luck with any NBA team other than the one that drafted him with last summer's 16th overall pick. That's the Catch-22: The very thing that gave Houston the faith in the first place to take a chance on White the numbers and their reliance on them is the very reason he's not going anywhere any time soon. Where Houston still sees in the analytics a possibly great future, many general managers see a hot damn mess. Sources familiar with the Rockets' thinking say the team will entertain no offers this season for White, in large part because they value his basketball potential so highly and know his value around the league has diminished so much during this drama. One league source said the Rockets, having watched White sit out a year in college before resurrecting his career at Iowa State, will follow the same pattern and wait him out. They are now going forward as if White will not be available to them until next season, taking away whatever leverage White may have had or any hope any other team had of basically getting the same longshot for a much cheaper price. If White is playing chicken, he's making a mistake and doing so with an organization making choices on the patterns and the numbers, not on the very human urge to wash their hands of such a bundle of trouble and move on. They will wait him out. It might not be entirely a bad move. The Rockets have gotten themselves to a point where they have little choice. It gives White another year to get to a place where he can play for this team. And it allows the Rockets to be calculating rather than emotional in trying to protect what right now is a very public, very ugly first-round bust. They also can do this in large part because very quietly, under the cover of the Los Angeles Lakers going to shambles and the Los Angeles Clippers sustaining their excellence, Houston has built itself into a Western Conference team that has to be taken seriously. The Rockets have won 10 of their last 13 games, including home wins against the Lakers, Atlanta and Memphis and road wins against the Knicks and Bulls. During that stretch, two of their three losses came at the hands Oklahoma City and San Antonio. They are the sixth seed in the Western Conference, but they're playing as well as most any team from the East right now. The Rockets' idea that analytics should play a large role in dictating the future of an NBA franchises has largely worked. Chandler Parsons, Omer Asik and Patrick Patterson have dramatically better per-game numbers this season than last season, Jeremy Lin remains a work-in-progress that seems certain to bear some fruit, James Harden has been phenomenal and even role player Marcus Morris has made a vast improvement after a troubled rookie season. So while Houston made the ultimate analytics mistake with White and allowed the numbers to seduce them so completely they missed the obvious, it's also true that they're doing just fine without their first-round pick. Take that and the fact this is an organization that will follow the numbers to their inevitable conclusion, throw in how much White has hurt his own standing in the league, and it's little wonder he will be a Houston Rocket for the foreseeable future.",Raw Data
367,"LeRoy Butler would try to guess the number of concussions he suffered as an NFL player, but he knows any attempt to pinpoint specifics is futile. ""The word 'concussions' was not prevalent,"" said Butler, who played with the Green Bay Packers during his entire NFL career (1990-2001). ""When we played, it was just that your bell got rung or you've got cobwebs. It wasn't widely known that you just went through trauma to the head."" Butler is among a group of nearly 80 former Packers players -- and more than 2,000 former NFL players overall -- involved in lawsuits against the NFL over concussion-related issues. More than 80 pending lawsuits were consolidated into a master complaint list filed last week in Philadelphia. Among the biggest points of contention by Butler and others is that the league withheld information regarding the dangers of concussions for years. By concealing that information, Butler said, star players would be more likely to return to games with more immediacy, helping to create a more appealing money-making product for the NFL. The other purpose of the lawsuit is to hold the NFL responsible for providing health care to former players, some of whom are experiencing neurological disorders they believe stem from playing professional football. Butler said the NFL provides health care to former players for five years after their last game, but nothing beyond that point. ""Everybody in your 20s and 30s, you feel good enough and the adrenaline is enough where everything is normal,"" said Butler, 43. ""But when the adrenaline stops and you start to age, all those hits catch up with you. Once your brain is damaged, you can't get another brain. You can get another knee. Hell, you can get another heart. But you can't get another brain. Once you hurt that, you're screwed."" Tony Mandarich, the No. 2 overall draft pick by the Packers in 1989, estimated that in his six-year career he suffered six to 10 concussions that were officially on the books from doctors -- and perhaps even more that went unrecorded. Mandarich, who spent three of those years with the Indianapolis Colts, said the standards for determining concussions were severely lacking when he played. ""This is how Mickey Mouse the protocol used to be,"" said Mandarich, who also is suing the NFL. ""You get your bell rung, you get on the sideline and it's like, 'Do you know what year it is? Do you know who the president is?' If you pass those tests, you're good to go."" However, Mandarich, 45, admitted that even if the NFL had presented information disclosing the long-term effects of concussions, 95 percent of players in the league would still want to play. But he also noted that, of the 95 percent, some might be more willing to take extended time off or retire after the next concussion. As part of the class-action lawsuit, lawyers representing the players will focus on research conducted by the mild traumatic brain injury committee from 1994 to 2007, which shows a direct correlation between football and brain injuries. Plaintiffs will argue the NFL neglected to share that research. Of course, players involved in the lawsuit could face a slippery slope because the NFL has denied withholding any information about concussion dangers. The league also will try to have the case dismissed by arguing the issues were governed by the collective bargaining agreement in place at the time. ""The NFL has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so,"" an NFL spokesperson said in an emailed statement to FOXSportsWisconsin.com. ""Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players had no merit. It stands in contrast to the league's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions."" In addition to the dispute regarding the dangers of concussions, former NFL players are fighting for health care to be provided by the league. For most players, the signs of body degeneration occur well after a playing career -- and well after the five-year health care window given by the NFL to players expires. Dave Roller, a seven-year NFL veteran who played for the Packers from 1975-78, said he underwent knee replacement surgery that cost nearly $100,000. He said the NFL offered him $5,250 in assistance. ""You almost had to pull teeth to get that out of them,"" said Roller, 62, who also is involved in the class-action lawsuit. ""It took me forever. I'm grateful that they helped a little bit, but a little bit is nothing. ""Come on guys, why don't you give us Blue Cross Blue Shield across the board and cut it off wherever you think? They started making more money than God, and that way they can take care of themselves."" Butler, who played in 181 regular season NFL games, said he now experiences occasional memory loss, as well as blurred vision, neck problems and inability to sleep. Mandarich said he, too, began to experience memory and motor-skills issues in the past 18-24 months and worries about the possibility of dementia. In the past two years, former NFL players Dave Duerson, Ray Easterling and Junior Seau have died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Duerson and Easterling both suffered from dementia. Butler, Mandarich and Roller each insist the class-action lawsuit is not part of a money grab by former players. They say the lawsuit is a matter of principle, to make the league do what they believe is right. ""They can take my share of the money and donate it, whether it's to the NFLPA or whether it's to the NFL for concussion research,"" Mandarich said. ""I don't want their money. I don't need their money. The only thing I would take from them is if they offered health care. I'm in it for the quality of life of the players that have left the game and the future players that are going to leave the game."" Roller noted that in 2010, the NFL earned $9 billion in revenue -- a figure he believes could be used to assist former players in need of health care. ""I'll be damned if I'm going to let them roll over me and take $9 billion a year and not do something for us,"" Roller said. ""I could care less about the owners. I could care less about the NFL. But they're going to take care of us one way or the other.""",Raw Data

Djokovic, who defeated Andy Murray in the final, hopped on a 3 AM flight to Europe afterward, as he is scheduled to play in Serbia’s Davis Cup tie against Belgium on indoor clay beginning Friday. “In life, you know, you don't get many of the opportunities to win Grand Slams,” he said. “As a tennis player, that's a pinnacle of the ambitions and of the success. So I try to enjoy it for few days with the people I love the most, family, friends, and team. And then after I turn to the rest of the season. It's Davis Cup already coming up. And then after that, there is still four or five months till the French Open. Of course, I want to go all the way in French Open.

370,"Former Texas Rangers outfielder Josh Hamilton is throwing fire at his former home, saying that the Dallas Fort-Worth area isn't a good baseball town in an interview with the Dallas Fort-Worth CBS affiliate. ""There are true baseball fans in Texas, but it's not a true baseball town,"" said Hamilton. ""They're supportive,"" Hamilton said about the fans, ""but they also got a little spoiled at the same time pretty quickly."" ""You think about three to four years ago (before two straight World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011). It's like, come on man, are you happier there again?"" If you want to see a textbook example of burning bridges on your way out of town, take a look at Hamilton's comments in this interview. He signed a five year, $125 million deal with the Angels this year, and Texas GM Jon Daniels was reportedly not pleased about not being given a chance to match the Los Angeles offer to Hamilton. Rangers manager Ron Washington essentially blew off Hamilton's comments. ""I'm not answering anything that Josh said,"" Washington said. ""That's Josh. Josh is an Angel. That's Josh's opinion. My opinion is there were 3.5 million fans that came through the turnstiles. That answers it right there."" Rangers left fielder David Murphy, who will be expected to pick up some of the slack on offense after Hamilton's departure, went the opposite route of Hamilton and praised the Rangers' fanbase. ""We've had an absolutely electric environment to where I think visiting teams coming to play us in Arlington probably view it as hostile a place as there is in baseball and that definitely plays to our advantage,"" Murphy said. ""I definitely (like) the way that the fans have come out and supported us. The last few summers have been extremely hot. It's going to be tough for me to come watch a baseball game when it's 110 degrees out or 105 degrees out. I really appreciate the way they've supported us, especially through all the heat."" You can say what you want to say about the lack of tact in Hamilton's comments, but the Rangers drew less than two million fans in a season as recently as 2008, and drew 2.1 million fans in 2009 before increasing substantially in the last three seasons, topping out at 3.4 million this past season. Winning obviously draws fans in droves, and with the Rangers never having sustained success until the past three seasons, it's been tough for the team to steadily bring fans in. 2013 will be the test for the Rangers fanbase after the team collapsed late in the season and lost the wild card playoff game to the Orioles. With Hamilton and Mike Napoli both departing Texas, it could be a rough season for the Rangers, and the patience of their fans could be tested.",Raw Data
371,"Stephen Maguire has set himself the challenge of rapidly adding to his trophy haul after ending the hurt of his five-year wait to win a ranking event title at the BetVictor Welsh Open. World Championship. Click here to bet. The Scot showed tremendous nerve and character in Newport as he battled back from 7-5 down to eventually prevail 9-8 after a final-frame shoot-out with Stuart Bingham and take the £50,000 first prize. Maguire's last title had come at the China Open in 2008, since when he has lost three finals, including in Wales in 2011. The Glaswegian's talent has never been in doubt, but he admitted he had been unsure whether he would ever end another tournament as the man holding the trophy. It sets the 31-year-old up nicely for the World Championship, but Maguire is not looking too far ahead, instead wanting to add another victory to his tally before heading to the Crucible in April. ""I feel great now and I will feel great for the next few days. But I have another tournament coming up in China very soon and I want to be able to push on from here,"" he said. ""I don't want it to be five years before I win another trophy, that was too long and I was starting to doubt if I would ever do it again. Now I am back in the winner's enclosure it is very important I push on. ""I want to make sure I do not lose touch with the boys who have been winning tournaments. There have been guys winning tournaments who I think I am better than and it was hurting me. ""A lot can happen between now and the World Championship, there are three tournaments and I would like to win another trophy. ""This year's World Championship is wide open but it does not get better than winning a tournament, particularly as it is getting harder every year."" Maguire was particularly pleased with the resolve he showed with the final apparently slipping away from him. There were moments during the 12th and 13th frames where he looked a beaten man, sitting in his chair with his head in his hands, but he bounced back up off the canvas. ""I was very pleased with the way I finished the match, especially after I let him get back to 8-8 after I had been leading 8-7, at that point I thought I had let it go,"" he said. ""I had to have a few words with myself and I was chuffed to get the chance to win it and make it count."" Bingham was devastated to have seen a match-winning position slip through his fingers, particularly a simple pink he missed to make it 8-5 when Maguire was struggling. But the Essex player, who is set to climb to seventh in the world rankings, is confident he is heading in the right direction with Sheffield looming on the horizon. He said: ""I am gutted, it would have meant so much to secure the trophy. But it has been a brilliant week and I've pulled a few matches out of the fire against Neil Robertson and Ding Junhui. ""Maybe I am biased but I think I was the better player in the final, I came out and took the game to him in the evening session and when it went to 7-5 I had chances but I blew them.

372,"﻿ Silly as it seems, a feather that floated past Andy Murray in the second set tiebreaker and contributed to a double fault might have helped change the course of an Australian Open final that, in the end, was dominated by Novak Djokovic, who wrapped up his third straight title at Melbourne Park with a 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-2 victory. Novak Djokovic got the better of rival Andy Murray this time, winning the 2013 Australian Open men's final. See the photos. Murray had run away with the first-set tiebreaker 7-2, and Djokovic had needed to fight his way out of 0-40 on his serve in the second game of the second set. The Serb, subdued in the beginning, had been making an unusual number of unforced errors — especially with backhands dumped into the net — and Murray was the favorite to establish a two-sets-to-love lead when the second tiebreaker began. The score was 2-2 when Murray, having missed his first serve, noticed a bird’s feather floating into his line of vision. “It just caught my eye before I served,” he said. “I thought it was a good idea to move it. Maybe it wasn’t, because I double faulted.” Djokovic quickly went 5-2 up. He survived a strength-sapping rally when Murray eventually netted a backhand and, at 6-3, needed only one of three set points to level the match. The contest was never the same again. This duel between two players who promise to dominate the men’s game in the immediate future was never as good or as enthralling as their five-set struggle last year in the US Open final, but it was kept alive by Murray’s refusal to give up, even as his movement became increasingly hampered by a huge blister on his toe — a legacy of his four-hour, five-set battle against Roger Federer just 48 hours earlier. In the third and fourth sets, many of the ex-players following the match, such as Jim Courier and John Fitzgerald, were agreed Murray could no longer push off or change direction as Djokovic increasingly used the legitimate tactic of hitting balls behind him. “Ninety percent of the players on the tour will have played this tournament with some sort of blister or problem,"" he said. ""It had no bearing on the result. It just hurts a little bit when you run. It’s part and parcel of playing these big events against the best players in the world.” At the US Open, the scheduling and the wind, which seemed to affect Djokovic’s game far more than Murray’s, ensured he had the lion’s share of the luck. Here, it was the reverse. For a start, it was he who drew Federer as a semifinal opponent while Djokovic played Rafael Nadal’s replacement as No. 4 seed, David Ferrer (winning in straight sets), and it was Djokovic who had the extra day to prepare between the semifinal and final. It happens. No one has ever won a Grand Slam event without a little luck, and it in no way diminishes the Serb’s achievement. His superb flexibility and athleticism, which enable him to reach and return shots that few could even contemplate, have taken him, quite deservedly to the top of the game. To beat Djokovic, you need to play out of your mind and be close to 100 percent physically. Murray played well enough but his body let him down. Djokovic was obviously thrilled at his victory. “I’m full of joy right now,” he said. “It’s going to give me a lot of confidence for the rest of the season, that’s for sure.” Djokovic admitted that getting out of that game from 0-40 was probably a turning point in a match that lasted 3 hours, 40 minutes. “I think the first two sets went 2 hours, 20 minutes,” he said. “I think that says enough about the intensity. I kind of expected that. After saving those break points, I just felt mentally a little bit lighter and more confident on the court than I had done in the first hour or so. I tried to be more aggressive. I needed to be the one who dictated the play, and I’m really glad that I’ve played my best.” If criticism could be leveled at Murray on a tactical level, it was the way he refused to get in after opening up the court. Djokovic made 41 sorties to the net and won 85 percent of them. Murray got in only 15 times and was successful only 60 percent of the time. It is something he will be discussing, no doubt, when he is reunited with coach Ivan Lendl in Florida in a couple of weeks. For Djokovic, there is no rest. He was catching a late flight out of Melbourne so as to prepare for a Davis Cup tie against host Belgium in Charleroi on Friday. As Serbia’s No 2 player, Janko Tipsarevic, is unlikely to play, Djokovic’s team will need him.",Raw Data

''A chance to go out there and play the game you love, and help this team win football games. That's all I wanted.'' Ryan acknowledged Wednesday that he had higher expectations for Tebow in the wildcat. ''For some reason, it hasn't panned out to my expectations and maybe Tim's, either,'' Ryan said.

374,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Gonzalez was telling “anyone who would listen” on the Atlanta Falcons sideline that all was not lost after the Seattle Seahawks had taken a one-point lead with 31 seconds remaining in Sunday’s second-round playoff game. Gonzalez, though, was thinking that his 16-year NFL career would end without a postseason victory. “Yeah, I thought it was over,” the future Hall of Fame tight end admitted during an emotional postgame interview. “Why wouldn’t I? This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. “Not over, but I thought it was going to be very tough for us to pull a victory out. And it is tough. Statistically, what is the likelihood you’re going to be able to make a play in that situation?” The odds aren’t good. Then again, not every team has Matt Ryan at quarterback. For the first time in his five-year NFL career, Ryan’s penchant for late regular-season heroics carried over into the playoffs. Two completions spanning 41 yards put Matt Bryant in position for the 49-yard field goal that lifted Atlanta to a 30-28 victory. “Your past experiences kind of harden you,” Ryan said after notching his 22nd career fourth-quarter/overtime comeback victory and sixth of this season. “They make you a little tougher in those types of situations. “If you have an opportunity with time still on the clock, you feel like you could get it done.” It’s a good thing for Ryan, head coach Mike Smith and the entire organization that he did just that. Otherwise, the current regime may have suffered a setback the caliber of which there is no recovering from. Atlanta’s squandering of a 20-0 halftime lead Sunday would have proven the most painful of the three previous playoff defeats since Smith and Ryan joined the franchise in 2008. Ryan would have become regarded as being unable to win the big one like Tony Romo. Smith would be placed in the same light as Marty Schottenheimer, whose regular-season success failed to translate into the playoffs. Because of these prior flops, the outside pressure enshrouding the Falcons during the past week was suffocating. Locals feared a repeat of 2010 when another red-hot club (Green Bay) came into the Georgia Dome and snuffed the Falcons. Normalcy was stressed throughout pregame preparation at Falcons headquarters to try and alleviate any tension. Offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter even told players not to watch or listen to sports programming. “Obviously, it’s something that’s been a monkey on our back,” Falcons left tackle Sam Baker said. “There are so many talking heads out there that had this thing about the past. We knew this was our year and we can get this done.” The Falcons were well en route to doing exactly that. Atlanta opened a 20-0 halftime advantage against a Seahawks squad that seemed jetlagged from back-to-back airplane trips across the country. But just like in last Sunday’s 24-14 first-round playoff win in Washington, Seattle came storming back after falling behind early. Atlanta’s defense – which end Kroy Biermann said came out “flat” post-halftime with such a lofty lead – had no answer for Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. As the rookie channeled the spirit of Fran Tarkenton with his scrambling and throwing, Ryan reverted to looking more like Joe Webb. In Atlanta’s first three drives of the fourth quarter, Ryan was 1 for 4 passing for three yards with an interception that led to a Seattle touchdown. By the time Marshawn Lynch scored on a two-yard run to put Seattle ahead, 28-27, a hush fell over the crowd of 70,366 fans. Some began heading to the exits. This is the same building where Ryan first showed his mettle as a rookie in 2008 with even less time remaining (11 seconds) in a come-from-behind victory over Chicago. Earlier this year against Carolina, the Falcons were pinned at their 1-yard line with 59 seconds left. Ryan connected with Roddy White on a 59-yard completion to help set up another Bryant game-winning field goal. So when Atlanta’s offense took the field after Jacquizz Rodgers returned the ensuing kickoff to the Falcons 28-yard line, there was no panic in the huddle as Ryan addressed the group. “It’s kind of the same message each time I go out there in those situations,” Ryan said. “It’s not going to be a fire-and-brimstone speech. It’s more of, ‘Alright, let’s just do our job. We’ve got the time. We’ve got the timeouts. We need to execute.’ I thought everyone did that.” Wide receiver Harry Douglas did his part, making a tough 22-yard reception near the Falcons sideline. After a timeout, Gonzalez – who has announced a “95-percent” likelihood of retirement after this season – ran down the seam for a 19-yard catch. Not wanting to take any chances, Smith used his final timeout and sent Bryant out for a 49-yard field goal. An attempt to freeze Bryant by Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll with his own timeout didn’t work. Bryant nailed what proved his sixth game-winning kick since joining the Falcons in 2009. “It’s good to be able to reflect on that feeling,” said Bryant, who had connected from 61 yards during pregame warmups. “You know how good it feels. It’s just trying to duplicate the same actions because you don’t want to feel the opposite.” Atlanta’s secondary received a reminder of what being a goat was like Saturday when watching the end of Baltimore’s double-overtime victory over Denver. Determined not to get beat on a deep pass like the Broncos did at the end of regulation, the Falcons dropped a slew of players into the end zone on the game’s final play. One of them was wide receiver Julio Jones, who jumped to intercept Wilson’s pass as time expired. “We didn’t want a nightmare like with Baltimore,” Falcons safety Thomas DeCoud said. “We definitely took that to heart. As DBs we looked each other in the eye and said, ‘Nothing over the top.’” Feed your NFL addiction! Come feast on all the news in our updating blog. As spirited as the post-game celebration was, the Falcons know another second half like the one against Seattle will lead to elimination in next Sunday’s NFC Championship Game against visiting San Francisco. 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is just as capable a thrower and even better runner than Wilson, who opened the second half completing all 10 of his pass attempts for 185 yards and two touchdowns. Atlanta’s offense also can’t afford another lengthy malaise. “We’ve got to learn from this,” Gonzalez said. The Falcons, though, did learn they could hold their own against an opponent renowned for its physicality. Led by Michael Turner, the Falcons rushed for a season-high 167 yards. The offensive line didn’t allow a sack against a Seahawks defense that sorely missed end Chris Clemons, who suffered a season-ending knee injury against Washington. DeCoud also believes the experience of trying to defend Wilson will come in handy against Kaepernick, who set the NFL’s single-game rushing record for a quarterback with 181 yards in Saturday night’s 45-31 win over Green Bay. “We’ve got a little cheat sheet with six-point font ready,” DeCoud said with a laugh. Check out the FOXiest fans from stadiums across the country and tweet us your photo. There is one more thing that should benefit the Falcons in the quest for their first Super Bowl appearance in 14 seasons: No more reminders about what was an ugly postseason history. “It will be nice, that’s for sure,” Ryan said with a smile. “But at the same time, our goal isn’t to win one playoff game. It’s not to stop answering that question. “Our goal is still in front of us. We have two more games to go.” Even though it looked like they wouldn’t have any.",Raw Data
375,"(Eds: Deletes extraneous letter in name of WNBA president. With AP Photos.)By DOUG FEINBERGAP Basketball WriterMaya Moore has excelled everywhere she's played, winning championships from college to the WNBA and Europe. Now she's leaving her mark on the Chinese women's basketball league. Averaging 45 points a game for the Shanxi Flame, Moore has helped bring new fans to the women's game in a basketball crazed nation. ''They show maybe five NBA games a week here,'' Moore told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ''They get a good amount of coverage and people love it. We are starting to get a little more interest about our game.'' The NBA long has seen China as a place for huge growth. It was evident at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 with the basketball games sold out and the contest between the U.S. men and China having nearly 100 million viewers. With Europe still feeling the effects of the financial downturn, China's competitive salaries and shorter season have made it one of the top destinations for the world's elite women basketball players. The former UConn star is earning mid-six figures, which is on a par with European salaries. While most European leagues go from October to May, China only plays till February. This will give Moore time to rest before the Minnesota Lynx open training camp in May. It also will provide the young face of women's basketball the opportunity to participate at the NBA All-Star game in February and be around for the women's Final Four. Besides Moore, the talent is improving throughout the league. Tamika Catchings, Elizabeth Cambage, Sophia Young and Jayne Appel are all playing this year. Swin Cash has played there in the past. ''I think it's been a good introduction for a lot of the fans seeing some of the Olympic level women over here,'' Moore said. ''To see the talent it's been I think very surprising thing for the fans. Interest will continue to spark more of a demand for players and the basketball level will rise. This area of the world will continue to want basketball even more, elevating that market.'' The WNBA has taken notice of the recent boom in China. ''We know the sport of basketball is on the rise in China and the WNBA has already had great success on the international stage,'' WNBA President Laurel Richie said. ''I am really encouraged that there are now many more millions of people around the globe - including China - who know what the WNBA is all about. We've exposed more people to the game, to the players, to the story both on and off the court ... and this will only help grow our league both domestically and abroad.'' While Moore has definitely brought interest with her play, Catchings has tried to mentor her teammates. ''I think my approach is probably different then the approach of some of the younger players,'' Catchings said in an e-mail to The Associated Press. ''I feel like my job is to teach my teammates how I play and how to have fun doing it.'' It didn't take long for Moore to endear herself to her new team. Moore, the first woman basketball player to be signed by the Jordan brand, gave a pair of yellow and red sneakers to each of her teammates. Then she started playing and the team only has lost once since. Moore introduced herself to the Chinese fans almost immediately with a 60-point performance in her third game, which just happened to be nationally televised. ''The game was against one of the army teams,'' Moore said. ''They don't have a foreigner and they are very prideful. The first quarter I was in a zone feeling good. I hit seven 3's in the first quarter. It gave me a jump start on the 60.'' Moore was hard-pressed to remember ever scoring close to that before. She had 48 in high school and 48 was her college best. Connecticut and Olympic coach Geno Auriemma wasn't surprised by his former star's success. ''Maya is Maya,'' he said. ''Her scoring that many points isn't a real shock. She can really do whatever she wants.'' Basketball has been the easy part for Moore since coming over to China. Communicating with teammates has taken a little more work with up to four languages being spoken in team huddles. ''It's pretty comical,'' Moore said laughing. ''I speak English, one of my teammates is Korean. That's two languages. Two of our coaches are Spanish - one is the Spanish national team head coach. The first couple days I was there my head was spinning.'' On the court, there don't seem to be many communication issues. The team uses hand signals, numbers, and Moore said she learned some basic words to get through. ''I'm getting better, I know about 10 words so far, I'm learning new ones every day,'' she said. Moore also has a personal assistant assigned by the team to help her with basics like grocery shopping and getting around. ''I think the success to your playing overseas really relies heavily on your translator and how well the team is able to help you adjust to them and being in a foreign country,'' said Catchings, who also has spent time playing in Korea. ''It's definitely an adjustment. Your team and the organization becomes your family while you are over here.'' Moore, who played in Spain last winter, also has had the benefit of having her mom with her. She came over in October and has spent most of the first two months in China, including Thanksgiving. The two have been put up in a ''western-style'' hotel for the four-month season. ''It's really been great having her around and she'll be here for Christmas,'' Moore said. ''She's experiencing China herself.'' Among the things Moore has learned to appreciate while being in China are some of the freedom she has in the U.S. ''It's kind of hard not having unrestricted Internet,'' she said. ''There's certain things you can't view. Certain liberties you don't have. YouTube, Twitter, things like that. There are certain social medial sites. You're so used to having access to whatever we need. It's different that way.''",Raw Data
376,"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. It is easy to paint the firing of Mike Brown just five games into the second season of a four-year, $18 million contract as an overreaction of Steinbrenner-like proportions. It wasn't. The firing of Brown simply was an acknowledgement by Jim Buss -- the son of Lakers owner Jerry Buss -- that he never should have hired Brown in the first place. Read into the Princeton offense, the hard-driving practices, the absent defensive intensity of the early season all you like, but they were simply symptomatic of a problem that should have been apparent the first time Jim Buss sat down with Brown. He isn't a big picture guy. Brown is, as general manager Mitch Kupchak noted in opening his press conference Friday, a genuine and decent man, and it would be hard to find a coach who devotes more of himself to the job. That might have been fine in Cleveland, and it might have been fine with the Clippers, but the Lakers are a different animal from any place else in the NBA. The Lakers are the Knicks with expectations, a franchise where players have had their own reality shows (Lamar Odom) and their own realities (Metta World Peace), and where the expectations are outsized only by the size of the big top. It's a place where, when the coach dates the owner's daughter, everyone just shrugs. All of which is a way of saying that Buss should swallow his pride again the way he did Friday in acknowledging one mistake and correct another by bringing back Phil Jackson. Jackson wasn't just allowed to retire after the Lakers' failed run at another three-peat in 2011. It's as if he were told to take all his belongings with him, too. Buss did not have a conversation with Jackson at any time during his final season, and Brian Shaw -- his top assistant who had a long and close relationship with Kobe Bryant -- was passed over. There also was a purge of the training, scouting and equipment staff, a move that stood out in a franchise that had prided itself on family. If the Buss family chafed at having to pay Jackson $12 million a year he took a pay cut to $10 million in his final season they'll now pay Brown about $13 million to walk away. The reason Jackson was worth every penny is that he understood what was really important and he carried a strong enough personality and, yes, 11 championship rings to stand behind his beliefs. If the Lakers were lackadaisical in a loss, Jackson wouldn't berate them. He'd simply write on the dry-erase board, ""Bus at 11,"" and let the players decide when they wanted to stop being embarrassed. This sort of approach gave Laker players a sense of calm during the turbulent moments the Lakers typically endure, especially during the playoffs. If you think players are naturally impervious to this, then you did not see 36-year-old Antawn Jamison emerge from the shower and enter the locker room after the opening night loss to Dallas, his first game as a Laker. He was stunned by the sight of about 50 reporters. ""Wow,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like this."" Any discomfort in reuniting with Jackson, now 67 and recovered from knee replacement surgery last March, should be finessed away easily enough. At least easier than his second run with the Lakers, which came after he published a memoir calling Kobe Bryant uncoachable. Kupchak acknowledged that the Lakers will at least have a conversation with Jackson. ""When there's a coach like Phil Jackson, one of the all-time greats, and he's not coaching, I think you would be negligent not to be aware that he's out there,"" Kupchak said. Where Steve Nash would fit with a triangle offense is a question that easily could be resolved, and so many of the Lakers' core Pau Gasol, Bryant, World Peace, Steve Blake already are familiar with that offense. The one sticky matter could be how long Jackson expected to return and how it would impact Dwight Howard's decision to re-sign when he becomes a free agent this summer. The Lakers, who might not have been in this circumstance had they hired Rick Adelman two years ago, are fortunate to have some other capable coaches on the market, the place Kupchak said they were most likely to look. Mike D'Antoni, who has a strong relationship with Nash and has worked with Howard and Bryant on Team USA, certainly would be an improvement. Nate McMillan is a strong defensive coach who has a good relationship with Bryant from the last two Olympics. ""I love Nate,"" Bryant said in 2011. ""He's a no-nonsense guy."" It also is likely the Lakers would ask Indiana for permission to speak with Shaw, whose easy demeanor and ability to talk frankly with the strongest personalities would serve him well. But for the Lakers, if they are as all-in as their summer suggested, there is one call to make. It's one that would re-energize the locker room as well as the fan base, and put someone on the bench who can see not just what is happening on the court, but what is going on down the road. The Lakers corrected one mistake Friday. They know how to fix another.",Raw Data
377,"On Sunday afternoon, basketball fans in both East Lansing and Columbus will have to do something they will probably find distasteful. They are going to have to cheer for the University of Michigan. That's how this crazy Big Ten season has ended up Spartans and Buckeyes having to cheer for Wolverines. If Michigan beats Indiana on Sunday, and MSU and OSU take care of their own business, the conference title will end up in a four-way tie, with the Hoosiers joining the same three schools that shared last year's championship. Of course, there's one major holdup to this Midwestern party the second-ranked team in the country. The Hoosiers handled Michigan comfortably last month in Bloomington, and the Wolverines haven't looked the same since. Michigan went into Assembly Hall with a 20-1 record, and have now won just five of their last nine games. The team that was blowing out everyone they faced for months has just one double-digit victory a 13-point victory over Illinois and managed to lose at Penn State. On the other hand, while it hasn't always been pretty an overtime win over Ohio State and a one-point victory over Michigan State, both saved by Trey Burke's defense the Wolverines come into the game with a perfect 17-0 record at the Crisler Center. The teams come into the game with the two best offenses in the country, so the title might come down to which team can get enough timely stops to make a game-breaking run. On paper, that's where Indiana has the advantage. They have a pair of two-way stars in Tyler Zeller and Victor Oladipo, and a big-time rebounder in Christian Watford. Those three will make things tough on Jordan Morgan, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Glenn Robinson III on both ends of the court, especially if Indiana can get rolling with their devastating fast break. Morgan and Hardaway, with help from Mitch McGary, will have to keep Zeller and Oladipo from dominating at the rim offensively, and they will have to do it without much help. Teams that try to pack the paint to take away entry passes to Zeller and Oladipo's drives find themselves at the mercy of Jordan Hulls and Watford, both of whom are hitting almost 50 percent of their 3-point attempts this season. In the first game between these teams, Hulls, Watford and point guard Yogi Ferrell combined to hit 6 of 10 3-pointers, while Zeller and Oladipo were going 13 for 19, much of it on the break. Indiana also got to the free-throw line 25 times in the game as opposed to just seven for the Wolverines, but that's not a surprise at Assembly Hall. Still, to win the rematch, Michigan will have to find a way to slow down Indiana and force them to work for points in the half-court offense. That's not a strength for Indiana, especially with a freshman at the point, and it is something the Wolverines must use to their advantage. On offense, there's no question how things will work Burke will control the game, especially against Ferrell. However, as good as he is, he can't beat the No. 2 team in the country by himself. Nik Stauskas needs to have a big game against Hulls, who is not a strong defensive player, and Robinson has to end his stretch of coming up small in big games. He only had two points on 1-of-6 shooting in the first game against Indiana, and has struggled in several of Michigan's other losses. It would also be a huge advantage if Morgan, McGary and Hardaway could get Zeller or Oladipo into foul trouble. The Hoosiers are not deep, and no team is going to be able to replace a Player of the Year candidate. That, of course, would be just as true if Indiana could get Burke on to the bench as well as Spike Albrecht has played at times, it's a massive loss when he's replacing Burke. Burke and Oladipo are the favorites for Big Ten Player of the Year, and two of the top contenders for the national award. They've both shown the capability of taking over huge games Oladipo did it at Michigan State, while Burke has done it several times for the Wolverines. If Oladipo does it again, the only banner going up next season will be in Bloomington, where they have already cut down the nets. But if Burke can drag the Wolverines to a perfect home season, well, that's when things get crazy. Michigan fans celebrating with Michigan State and Ohio State fans. Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria. In other words, the perfect ending for a wild Big Ten season.",Raw Data
378,"""Tall,"" ""lanky,"" ""uncoordinated"" were words used to describe me growing up; so were ""poor,"" ""shy"" and ""self-conscious."" I was raised in rural Indiana by an extremely hardworking woman who was left with the challenge of bringing up three young children on her own. My mom did everything from waitressing to working in factories to hairdressing out of our home, but without child support from our father it was hard to make ends meet sometimes. As a child, I was clueless to the level of poverty we were living in. I always felt loved, and my mom miraculously found a way to keep food on the table. As I got older, we qualified for the free and reduced lunch program and that is when I started to realize that we were different from everyone else. Sadly, there is a negative stigma around those programs that inhibit children from readily participating and receiving the necessary provision. Fortunately, my mom was someone who raised us to work as hard as possible at whatever task was before us, be willing to help others in need and be grateful for what we are given... all lessons that would prove to be the foundation of who I am today. By the time I was a freshman in high school, I was taller than all the girls in the school and all the boys but a few, which only added to the uncomfortably that accompanied my uncommon height. My self-esteem began to grow exponentially with my basketball development. Working as hard as possible at the task before me provided me with the grades and athletic ability I needed to gain a scholarship from the University of Notre Dame. My college experience brought everything full circle for me. Throughout my childhood, I had so many people help my family and I along the way, from family and friends to my AAU coaches and church members. As a collegiate athlete experiencing a certain level of success, I was introduced to the platform sport has to make a difference in people's lives. Walking into an elementary school for the first time, I was extremely nervous. I still was not completely comfortable with the spotlight that was starting to shine brighter on me because of my career or the stage that was being set for me to speak from. I questioned if my words would be adequate or if my story would be inspirational. Then I saw the look on the kids faces. Appreciation and excitement beamed from them, and it was then that I knew I was called to do more than just play the sport of basketball. It was then that my humanitarian spirit was born. When I reached the WNBA in 2001, the stage only got larger, and so did my philanthropic efforts including work with WNBA Cares. I have participated in dozens of local community events during my 12 years with four WNBA teams, but I have also had the opportunity to make strides on a larger scale through organizations like Nothing but Nets and Share Our Strength. My childhood experiences allow me to sympathize with kids growing up in low-income homes that are benefactors of Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry program. Reducing the stigma around such programs, encouraging families and children to utilize them, and advocating for funding are all things that I have tried to be involved in on a local and national level. I first traveled as an ambassador with Nothing But Nets in 2007 to Nigeria and Angola. The organization distributes life-saving and cost-effective bed nets to families to prevent the spread of malaria, which is transmitted through mosquito bites. Malaria is a leading cause of death among children under the age of 5 throughout Africa. Just as I had an eye-opening moment that first trip with my team at Notre Dame to the elementary school, I had an even larger one in Angola with a woman in the village we visited. She sat there with a child in one arm and the new mosquito net we were delivering in the other. With an immeasurable amount of gratitude, she went on to tell me that she had recently lost one child to malaria, but now she had hope that her youngest would have a chance to live. As I listened to her story, I recognized the same strength and determination that has always been exhibited by my mom. Just a few weeks ago, I returned from a month-long trip to South Africa and Namibia. These are two countries where sports for girls have generally been an afterthought, and when given the opportunity they are raised to play netball instead of basketball. Having an entire clinic full of girls excited about the sport of basketball and eager to learn and work hard on their game showed me a level of progress that I could not have imagined five years ago. Being there was more than just teaching skills on the court. It was during the conversations about athletics, school and life that I could see dreams forming before my eyes. I hope that their story, although different in ways, might still lead them places they could never imagined -- just like mine did! We have entered a time of year when giving back weighs heavily on people's minds. The beautiful thing about acts of kindness is that you do not have to be a professional athlete to have a platform to do something good. We all have our own unique area of influence, mine was shaped by my faith and my upbringing and then extended out by the sport I play. It is only fitting that Thanksgiving comes before Christmas on our calendars, because out of my gratitude comes my passion to give. This holiday season try sharing some of your life experiences, resources or skills with others -- undoubtedly your life will be changed in the process as well!",Raw Data
379,"FORT WORTH, Texas Texas A&M paid anywhere from $9.31 million to $12.41 million, depending on your media source of choice, to secede from the Big 12 in February. Aggies felt this to be too much, Big 12 types too little. Now, though, A&M has delivered what all parties have to agree was a fair parting gift, beating No. 1 Alabama, 29-24, behind a Heisman-worthy performance by Johnny Manziel. Because what A&M really gave their frenemies in the Big 12 on Saturday was a chance. With Texas A&M's upset of Alabama, little and unlikely Kansas State, the team almost assuredly to be screwed by the BCS if three or more teams finish undefeated, has a real good chance to play for a national championship. And it deserves to be in that game. Even if Notre Dame and Oregon are both undefeated, too. This is the tendency, I guess. Journalists tend to fall in love with the team that is right in front of their eyes on that Saturday. They write how great and wonderful and perfect everybody is until next week when they are somewhere else. What I discovered watching Kansas State was how kind of boring they are. They certainly are not a sexy team. The most effusive thing I can think to say is they are efficient, methodical and play crazy-smart football. They are also damn good. On what was shaping up to be an upset Saturday in college football, Kansas State coach Bill Snyder with Collin Klein and Co. handled business, easily beating TCU, 23-10, and thereby setting them up to be the No. 1 team in the country Sunday morning. ""I have no thought about it whatsoever,"" Snyder said in his typical buzz-kill self when asked his feelings when he learned 'Bama had lost. And Snyder pretty much spoke for his team. Player after Wildcat player talked about how underwhelmed they were about likely being No. 1 in all of football. ""We were kind of excited,"" Wildcats linebacker Jarell Childs said. How did y'all find out? A raucous post-game locker room announcement? ""No,"" kicker Anthony Cantele said. ""Coach Snyder does not like to talk about that stuff."" There is a charm in this rote recitation of not paying attention to polls and just focusing on the next game and basically saying whatever Snyder tells them to. It is probably why they are so good. These kids believe in Snyder so much what he says, what he does, what he stands for that they will run through a wall for him. Why would they not believe every single thing that he says? Do everything he asks? They're 10-0, and may have a chance to play for what would be Kansas State's first national championship. This is a good football team. And for all the talk of Klein Heisman, et al Saturday's game was won by Kansas State's defense. They out-defensed TCU, and did so again rather methodically. Yes, they were aided by TCU losing their quarterback, already their backup, for a good hunk of the game. What Kansas State did so amazingly well was just sucking the belief right out of TCU. Every time the Frogs looked to be putting something together, Kansas State's defense killed it. Klein was good, too, not his usual good that has him being mentioned in Heisman talk, but good considering the circumstance. Klein was playing despite apparently sustaining a concussion in last week's game. Apparently is a necessary word because Kansas State has a policy of not talking about injuries and did not allow Klein to speak after the game, ostensibly to avoid concussion questions. I do not understand why concussion questions are out of bounds. In this climate, with so much focus and attention on the possibly debilitating impact of concussions and playing football, those questions seem pertinent. And by all accounts, Klein is a bright enough kid to handle talking about it. There is no way he would have been out there if he were not 100 percent healthy so why not let him talk about what he went through? How he felt? How he was still able to score two rushing touchdowns and have a pretty good game against a good defense? Too often we ""protect"" athletes and from what? All anybody wanted to talk about Saturday was how Klein and Kansas State just keep finding a way. This is the Snyder way, though, and there is no arguing with the results. The Wildcats are methodical, efficient, damn good and deserving of a spot in the national championship game even if they will not say so. Or maybe because they won't.",Raw Data

Juan Pablo Montoya held off the No. 10 Wayne Taylor Racing Corvette DP of Max Angelelli by 21.922 seconds to give Ganassi its fifth overall win in the twice-around-the-clock endurance classic in only the team's 10th attempt. While considered a dominant performance by Montoya and co-drivers Scott Pruett, Memo Rojas and Charlie Kimball, the No. 01 Telmex Riley-BMW never really missed a beat, logging more than 2,500 miles in a race that saw a record 74 lead changes. Chip Ganassi Racing took its fifth overall victory in the Rolex 24 at Daytona. (Photo: Brian Cleary/GRAND-AM) The race came down to a four-way battle between Montoya, Angelelli, the No. 9 Action Express Racing Corvette DP of Joao Barbosa and AJ Allmendinger in the defending race-winning No. 60 Michael Shank Racing Riley-Ford, in the closing hour. However, avoidable contact between Barbosa and Allmendinger shortly after the final restart with 51 minutes to go saw the Portuguese star serve a stop-and-hold-plus-60-second penalty and the open-wheel-turned NASCAR star pit to clean the car's radiator. Both Montoya and Angelelli made late stops for splashes of fuel, adding some excitement, but no noteworthy change to the overall results. ""I thought we had a decent lead and that we were just going to go out there and drive for two and a half hours,"" Montoya said. ""But then you realize there's a caution and another caution, then another caution. ""I took my time to pass people. When I was told that the 9 [car] was going to get a penalty, I rode behind him for a couple of laps. As soon as he came in, I caught up to the 10 car in half a lap and a lap later, I passed him and drove away."" Allmendinger and co-drivers Justin Wilson, Marcos Ambrose, John Pew and Ozz Negri finished 55 seconds back in third, with the Corvette DP of Angelelli, Jordan Taylor and 2012 IndyCar Series champion Ryan Hunter-Reay settling for a runner-up finish. It proved to be a record-breaking run for the Ganassi crew, with Pruett's fifth overall win tying him with sports car legend Hurley Haywood for the most all-time Rolex 24 wins. ""This is an incredible day, all the way around,"" said Pruett, who now has a record ten Rolex 24 class victories. ""To win with these guys, to win with Chip, Telmex and BMW... I've gotten to know Hurley real well over the years by racing with him. Having him there at the end was pretty special."" Montoya and Rojas, meanwhile, picked up their third 24-hour victory, while Ganassi IndyCar pilot Kimball celebrated his first Rolex 24 crown in his sports car racing debut. The weekend belonged to Ganassi, which swept the front row in qualifying and ran 1-2 for parts of the race. The team's No. 02 Target entry of Dario Franchitti, Scott Dixon, Joey Hand and Jamie McMurray, however, retired with drivetrain issues with less than four hours to go. It appeared both the armada of Corvette DPs, along with the Ford-powered Rileys from Michael Shank Racing and Starworks Motorsport, were unable to match the pace of the Riley-BMWs.

""We were hoping, with our strategy, to make it to the end and get the win,"" Angelelli said. ""But the 01 car was in a different league. They were in [the] 'A' class. We were in [the] 'B' class."" MSR's No. 60 Riley-Ford undoubtedly had the comeback of the race, having made up seven laps following a first-hour tie rod failure and a fuel filter issue overnight, to finish a respectable third overall and in class. Thir recovery was aided by a revised wave-by procedure used under full-course cautions. ""We weren't going to beat the 01 car, so I thought we had a chance to compete for second,"" Allmendinger said. ""Fortunately, [Barbosa] got a penalty, so we could podium. It's one of those racing things. At that point, with an hour to go, it's go time."" Action Express Racing's Barbosa and co-drivers Christian Fittipaldi, Mike Rockenfeller and Burt Frisselle came home in fourth, with the similarly prepared Coyote-chassised Corvette DP from Spirit of Daytona completing the top-five after battling electrical issues overnight and a header problem with two hours to go. Another contender, the No. 2 Starworks Motorsport Riley-Ford of Ryan Dalziel, Alex Popow, Allan McNish and Sebastien Bourdais lost 15 laps due to a throttle linkage and brake line failure in the 22nd hour, relegating the pre-race favorites to a sixth place finish overall after a strong early run.

381,"Eight days after winning her first league championship, the 33-year-old Finals MVP told reporters that a busy summer and the most remarkable year of an already sterling career, has not changed her future plans. She'll keep playing basketball as long as her body allows. ''I haven't really thought about it (retirement),'' Catchings said Monday during a conference call with reporters. ''People keep asking me `How many years are you going to play. What about 2016?' Honestly, it depends on how my body feels and if I can get up and down the court and can play at the same level I'm used to. My biggest fear, is someone saying `I remember how she used to play.' At that time, I figure it's time to think about retirement.'' Using that gauge, she should be around a long time. This season, she finished eighth in the league in scoring (17.4 points), seventh in rebounding (7.6) and was named the WNBA's defensive player of the year for a record fifth time - all after spending the Olympic break in London leading the Americans to another gold medal. In 2011, Catchings was the league MVP. And despite the busy schedule, she still averaged 19.0 points in the playoffs - the highest of anybody who played five or more postseason games - and led the injury-riddled Fever to their first championship. Heck she's not even tired. ''It energizes me more,'' she said when asked whether she was worn down from playing an Olympic schedule right in the middle of the WNBA's regular season and then a full postseason schedule. ''I have just a few aches and pains that wouldn't go away, like every year,'' she said. ''I think you don't really think about things that much when you win as much as when you lose.'' She'll need more energy given her upcoming plans. Next Tuesday, she's expected to arrive in China, where she will play with the Guangdong Dolphins until February. She plans to make one trip back to the U.S., around Christmas so she can host her annual basketball camp. Otherwise, the American basketball star won't be back in her home country till February. By then, the Fever hope to have their star player re-signed to another one-year maximum contract, which they have done each of the past two years, just in time to make a run at defending their first title. ''Probably like any other player in the league, you want to win as many titles as you can before you retire,'' Catchings said. ''To wait this long and not really know what that feeling is like, now we know what it takes. We're only going to be getting better.''",Raw Data

Tiger Woods and Lee Westwood were also knocked out on Thursday. Woods lost 2&1 to Charles Howell III, while Westwood was beaten by Rafael Cabrera Bello of Spain. The opening day of action at the course had been postponed because of snow, with play delayed until 13:00 local time on Thursday. McIlroy changed club and ball suppliers at the start of this year in a lucrative deal but has struggled for form since, missing the cut in his opening event of the year in Abu Dhabi last month. And McIlroy knows he has plenty of work to do after his defeat to a player ranked 68 in the world who secured victory with a dramatic final three-foot putt. Top seeds at the WGC Match Play 2012: Luke Donald loses to Ernie Els in first round 2011: Lee Westwood loses to Nick Watney in second round 2010: Steve Stricker loses to Ross McGowan in first round 2009: Tiger Woods loses to Tim Clark in second round ""I drove really well, but couldn't take advantage of that,"" McIlroy said. ""If I'd hit my irons better it could have been a different story. ""I could have been three or four up early on, but let him get back into the match and he had a nice little run."" Lowry, meanwhile said: ""My knees were knocking over that final putt. ""I was very nervous going out and quite mad at myself for that, but I had a bit of luck that I needed and said to my caddie that he's not going to be liking this at all."" Howell, who was competing at the tournament for the first time in four years, made a 25-foot birdie at the 16th to take control of his match against Woods ""I had nothing to lose,"" said Howell, who started the year outside the top 100 in the world and hasn't qualified for this World Golf Championship in five years. ""In this format, match play is crazy. He's Tiger Woods. I was lucky to hang in there."" The final matches were played in near darkness, and they could have stopped after 15 holes. Woods wanted to play on, even though Howell had the momentum. Woods was two under for the day, and neither of them made a bogey. ""We both played well,"" Woods said. ""He made a couple of more birdies than I did. He played well, and he's advancing."" Westwood, who had led by three holes after nine, lost at the first extra hole to Cabrera Bello but there were wins for Ian Poulter, Justin Rose and Luke Donald.

383,"The January transfer window generally passes by with negligible notice by Sir Alex Ferguson. In fact, the last major business I remember being done in January (could be wrong here) was the signing of Evra and Vidic in 2006. Both of them became first team regulars, but it took them a while to settle in. That has always been Sir Alex’s main aversion to signing mid-season; even if you get a good player, they don’t have any integration period so it can put the team out of joint. Fair enough. But the transfer that has been announced today will not fall into that category. Wilfred Zaha will join United, but not until July 2013. This transfer has been in the gossip pages for most of the transfer window, but I stopped placing any value on them after Ronaldinho was meant to signing way back in 2002. He’s signed, he’s here, he’s going to revolutionise the club….wait, he’s at Barcelona airport? Anyway, it seems the deal has indeed been struck, proving papers are bound to get things right in the end, if only accidently. It was also made clear from the very start that any deal to prise Zaha away from Crystal Palace would not prise Zaha away from Crystal Palace. That is, an agreement would be made for the signing, but he would continue to play for Palace until the rest of the season. This is the state of affairs as it stands. The cost seems to be £10m, rising to around £15m with bonuses for future achievement. There is no doubt that he has talent, and much potential at the age of 20. He plays in an attacking role, a winger or a striker generally. The Crystal Palace team rate him very highly, and he is already a key part of their side, prompting the request to keep him for the rest of the season as Palace try to achieve promotion. It’s a classic young-player-with-potential signing by Utd, I do question whether he is exactly the kind of player that’s required. I think it certainly spells the end of Macheda’s attempt to prove his place, the aforementioned player will be loaned to Germany’s Stuttgart for the rest of the season and I doubt will feature in any plans beyond that. Many expect big things from Zaha, so let’s hope they are right. Thoughts and comments on whether Zaha is right for Utd below! Is the fee too high/too low? FA Cup action tomorrow against Fulham. Match report will be up on Sunday. Welcome back Uday! I agree, I think £10m is pretty high. I like the phrase 'English tax' though and Hernandez is an excellent comparison in terms of value. Also, Sneijder, linked with Utd for some time, has just gone to Galatasaray for about £8m. Obviously, he's 28, less resale value, but prices do seem very unpredictable these days. With regards to playing for England, he was named as a substitute for the Sweden match in November and came on as a late substitute. He's also named in the squad to face Brazil. He did pass up the possibility of being considered for the Ivory Coast squad for the African Cup of Nations, so that may mean he's made up his mind, unlike England who never do seem to know what's their best striker combination. However, even if he features against Brazil, and don't quote me on this but I believe it to be correct, as both of those games are friendlies, non-competitive fixtures in football law speak, he is still entitled to opt for the Ivory Coast at a later date, as he is still yet to appear in a competitive fixture. Time will tell I guess. 10 million to rise to 15 pending peformances etc.? I think this is a bit high for a guy with ""potential"". I think its ""English Tax"", or whatever they call it. Look at Hernandez. On a tangent, has he chosen to play for England? I heard something about him being undecided. And there are pros and cons to that, I am sure.

385,"Jason Whitlock writes about the sports world from every angle, including those other writers can't imagine or muster courage to address. His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. The return of Pau Gasol and Steve Nash to the lineup is likely to mask most, if not all, the symptoms afflicting the underachieving Los Angeles Lakers. But the perennial all-stars will do nothing to address the disease lurking deep inside the foundation of the Lakers, the malady that will prevent the high-priced collection of veterans from getting past the Thunder, Spurs or even the Grizzlies come playoff time. The root cause of the Lakers’ dysfunction has been consistent for 15 years. It is Kobe Bryant’s ego, his desperate pursuit of Michael Jordan’s legacy. L.A.’s Dwight Howard experiment is going to explode and implode in spectacular fashion unless someone in the Lakers organization is bold enough to kill Kobe’s Michael Jordan avatar so that Howard’s Bill Russell avatar can emerge and lead the Lakers. You follow? The wrong player is driving the Lakers. Dwight Howard is the second-most talented player in the league. He’s the single-most gifted defensive player the NBA has seen since Bill Russell. On a properly functioning, championship-chasing team, Howard cannot be a sidekick, a No. 2, Scottie Pippen. Can’t happen. The Heat tried it with LeBron James in Year 1 of the Big Three, and we know how that ended. Dwyane Wade is an awesome basketball player and a terrific leader, but he had to surrender the soul of the Heat to LeBron in order for the Heat to win a title. Kobe has to let go and let D12. Has to. Kobe has to accept that he is not the 34-year-old Michael Jordan. You see, at 34 Jordan was taking his final victory lap in Chicago, completing his second three-peat, securing his sixth title, winning his fifth MVP award and 10th scoring title. Kobe wants to duplicate that feat. He’s putting up MVP-like numbers. He leads the league in scoring. He’s shooting a career-high 47.8 percent from the field. He’s averaging five rebounds and five assists. He’s knocking down 38 percent of his 3-pointers. Oh, the numbers look great. The results? The Lakers stink. You can blame that on the injuries to Gasol and Nash. You can blame it on the incompetence of D’Antoni. I blame Kobe. He’s the guy stopping Howard from eating. Kobe is the guy giving Howard room to lose himself in his immaturity and hide. Here’s what Kobe has never understood about the Los Angeles Lakers. It’s an organization built to house and nurture giants. From George Mikan to Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Shaquille O’Neal, the Lakers function best when the once-in-a-generation big man the organization acquires is allowed to be the man of the house. Kobe emasculates his big men. Andrew Bynum politely admitted this week that Kobe stunted his growth. “I think Dwight is a great player, but he’s going to have to get accustomed to playing with Kobe and not touching the ball every single play,” Bynum said. The problem is deeper than touches. It’s a mentality that a big man must have in order to lead his team. Dwight Howard must enter every NBA arena with this mindset: “If I don’t hunt and kill, no one eats tonight.” That’s Kobe’s mindset. But at 34, having played 1,186 regular-season games and 220 playoff games, Kobe doesn’t hunt and kill as effectively as Howard. Kobe isn’t the same as a 34-year-old Jordan. At this stage in his career, Jordan had played 873 regular-season games and 158 playoff games. Jordan was still a force of nature. Don’t get fooled by Kobe’s numbers. He’s not Kevin Durant or Carmelo Anthony, and Kobe damn sure isn’t LeBron James. James, Durant and Melo can impose their will on the opposition. Over the course of a seven-game playoff series, they can mentally bludgeon an opponent into submission. We saw James do it to the Pacers and the Celtics in last year’s playoffs. Kobe is smart. He can be efficient. But he’s trying too hard right now. That’s why he leads the league in turnovers with 97. Kobe’s days of imposing his will in a playoff series are over. Howard’s days should just be beginning. If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: But Kobe’s ego is in the way. Howard can’t be the man of the house with Kobe sitting at the head of the table eating the biggest plate of food. As long as everything revolves around Kobe, as long as Kobe is on TV sitting across from Stephen A. Smith speaking in hushed, dark tones about the state of the Lakers, Howard gets to hide, gets to feel like the Lakers family can eat regardless of whether he chooses to hunt or not. Kobe needs to fall back. He’s Dr. J right now and he needs to let Dwight Howard be Moses Malone. That does not mean turn the offense over to Howard. It means building a strategy and philosophy that revolves around Howard’s many gifts, which are mostly at the defensive end (and make the hiring of D’Antoni even more ridiculous). It means forcing Howard to mentally and verbally take full responsibility for the success of the team. Howard is immature. We know that. We watched him in Orlando. Put some pressure on his ass. Make Howard explain why this team is underachieving. I know this column will appear to many as hatred of Kobe. I don’t hate Kobe. He’s a wonderful player and terrific competitor. He simply has to make the mental adjustment that Dwyane Wade made last season. Come May and June, the Lakers are going as far as Dwight Howard can take them. Nash and Gasol might help the Lakers recover and get into the playoffs. And Kobe is certainly capable of continuing to put up big numbers. But the Lakers are not winning a title if their second-best player continues to stunt the growth of their best player.",Raw Data

388,"For us, the telling paragraph in the Daily Mail news of Colin Murray's MOTD2 axing in favour of Mark Chapman was this: 'It is understood that the Ulsterman had also irritated a number of BBC football pundits by the way he criticised players. Chapman will be expected to ask Hansen and Co more questions rather than giving his own opinions as Murray preferred to do in his irreverent presenter's role.' Whatever you think about Colin Murray, this cannot be good news for the overall direction of the BBC's football coverage. The vaguely studenty banter that was Murray's MOTD2 go-to method isn't to everybody's taste, it's true. But we personally find him a decent presenter, especially when covering the lighter side. He has been perhaps less good on the meat and drink of the role - framing the flashpoint incidents between the big teams that get the juices pumping for the mainstream, big club fans. By which we mean 'moronic outrage junkies'. With more and more of the biggest games on Sundays, that may have worked against him. But all in all, we found his vaguely outsidery, smart alec younger brother shtick tolerable. And even if we had found it intolerable, at least it is a bit different from the norm. Mark Chapman comes over as an amiable cove and we wish him well, but we imagine the BBC bosses hope he will be a Ben Shephard type who is going to keep the real stars of the show, i.e. the older generation of ex-players, happy with regular bottom-lickery. This would be all well and good if said ex-players actually had anything special to offer. If it really is true that the BBC's big-name pundits were irritated by Colin Murray being insufficiently reverent to their views on the games, and that this has been a factor in his departure, that is a poor show by the BBC. It certainly seems very believable that the likes of Alan Shearer would find the views of a non-professional footballer contemptible and irrelevant. The BBC, however, should have told him to suck it up. Despite what Shearer et al seem to think, sitting there on that sofa they are not actually playing football. They are talking about football. These are two separate, albeit sometimes related, activities. If Shearer played football as well as he talked about football, he would be lucky to get a game in the Conference. Murray might not have been the Lionel Messi of football presenting, but he has an identifiable personality, the gift of the gab, an unusual voice, views of his own. If the ego of the BBC pundits is so out of control that they cannot tolerate anything other than, ""I abase myself before your wisdom, O great one"" questioning from a presenter, then the execs should be telling them to wind their neck in. One last thought, some of these ex-pros are getting very ex. Hansen retired in 1991, 22 years ago. Mark Lawrenson left the big time in 1988, when Thatcher was in power and grunge hadn't even happened. That's a sodding long time ago. Whatever football was like back then, it's not like it anymore. So how much does being an ex-pro from a different era count towards understanding the modern footballer more than say, an intelligent 25-year-old fan brought up in modern popular culture? Not much we'd say. The 55-year-old ex pro's 'special' dressing room knowledge, if that is why they're employed, is simply out-dated. Wednesday night's football provided a great opportunity for some discussion and opinion where having played the game was irrelevant. Assuming that professional players are not regularly practising kicking ball boys or how to deal with a time-wasting ball boy, then pretty much anyone's view is as valid as Glenn Hoddle's on this. It was an instance where really you'd just like to see a presenter with a trenchant view. Instead, the BBC had Trendy Vicar Manish intoning sorrowfully, ""two wrongs don't make a right"" on the highlights show. An opportunity missed we feel. This morning Pat Nevin helped put the record straight on Radio 4's Today programme. When interviewed by the always Partridge-esque Garry Richardson, the wee Scotsman said Hazard should have the red card rescinded; that the ball boy was wholly to blame and Hazard had merely tried to get him to release the ball. And all this from a self-proclaimed 'lefty Guardian reader'. Nevin also said he was disappointed that BBC footage on TV had been edited to show Hazard in a bad light. It must have been listening to all those Jesus And Mary Chain albums that gives Nevin his edge. Richardson was aghast and suggested Nevin was only saying this because he used to play for Chelsea, which was little short of an insult. Nevin rejected this vehemently. Richardson, clearly hoping for some Daily Mail style anti-footballer harrumphing, was stunned into near-silence. It was the sound of reactionary faux horror being shown up as the plastic emotion it so often is. So on this occasion, the ex-pro was the hero for kicking the presenter. We doubt this is much comfort to Colin Murray though.",Raw Data
389,"LOS ANGELES You wonder if at some point during the last few days Phil Jackson lifted his arm, stuck his nose under his armpit and took a long, deep, olfactory-opening breath. Hmmm, maybe thats the problem. It has to be something doesnt it, because how can a coach who has won ELEVEN championships in 20 seasons a) not get re-hired by the Lakers when they decided they couldnt win a championship with Mike Brown, b) not get a call from the Knicks this summer when they opened their coaching search, and c) get a nibble only from Portland when he put out the word that he would be interested in a consulting gig? If Bill Belichick is considered a genius for winning three Super Bowls, what title should be bestowed on Jackson, who has won nearly four times as many championships? Yet in a coaching career that has been defined by the unconventional who else would tie his prospects to a once-obscure offense that nobody wants to run, or ask his players to meditate? perhaps the most outside-the-box element of Jacksons story is playing out now: Why doesnt anybody want to hire this guy? I dont know, Kobe Bryant said Tuesday after the Lakers 84-82 loss to San Antonio. I dont know the answer to that question, I honestly dont. It seems like all our assistant coaches when they left here to even mention the word triangle was like taboo. I dont understand it. Its very strange. Its very bizarre. You would think that organizations and other cultures would try to learn from Phil thats what they should do right? If you had a coach who has won more than anybody else, you would kind of want to study them and analyze them and figure out why thats the case. But they havent done it. As he left the arena, Bryant said he was not sure why the Lakers passed on Jackson and instead hired Mike DAntoni, who will arrive in Los Angeles Wednesday and is expected to be on the bench either Friday against Phoenix or Sunday against Houston, depending on how his recovery from knee replacement surgery goes. Bryant, who has not spoken with Jackson since the summer, said that when he spoke Friday to Lakers vice president Jim Buss, the son of owner Jerry Buss, they both wanted Jackson. If Jackson were unavailable, then Bryant said he wanted DAntoni. If Jimmy would have said, No I dont want to have Phil here, then that would have stopped right there, Bryant said. If I said, No I dont want him, that would have stopped it right there. We both wanted him. I told him what I felt about Phil and how much I loved him, and it went down that road. It just didnt work out. Asked to cut through the spin from the Lakers, Jackson and others, and give his best understanding of what transpired, Bryant was circumspect. I cant afford to make assumptions or give my best understanding because then it turns into something else, said Bryant, who is a staunch supporter of DAntoni. I can only speak facts and I dont know. I havent spoken to Mitch. I havent spoken to Jimmy about what happened, the breakdown in negotiations. I dont know what transpired. There are many reasons being floated for why the Lakers did not turn to Jackson among them that he was asking for too much money, too much control, too many special circumstances and that he wasnt the best fit for their roster. But it is hard to escape the context of what has happened around the league since LeBron James bolted from Cleveland. Since then owners have been adamant about seizing their league back. If that was their intent in negotiating the new CBA, making it easier to control player movement, then it stands to reason that teams might shy away from coaches who can be dominant figures in Jacksons case, a Zeus-like personality. Lets face it: Jacksons modus operandi is to insulate the team not just from the outside world, but often from much of the organization. He feuded with Jerry Krause in Chicago, hastened the departure of Jerry West in Los Angeles and has no relationship with Jim Buss and typically used any type of turmoil to foster team unity. This is why Mike Brown appealed to the Lakers in the first place. And why elsewhere this summer, Stan Van Gundy was replaced by Jacque Vaughn in Orlando, Mike Dunlap a well-respected Division II college coach was hired in Charlotte, and why Terry Stotts, a sharp but mostly anonymous Dallas assistant, was hired in Portland. So, when it looked like Jackson would be reunited with the Lakers, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich likened it to the Evil Empire. I just had this thought that it was like putting the Soviet Union back together again, Popovich said. Lets go get Putin and put it all back together. The line that the Lakers are trotting out for why it did not happen is that DAntoni is a better fit for the current roster than Jackson. I know the triangle and I wasnt convinced, general manager Mitch Kupchak told reporters earlier Tuesday. Huh? Its as if Jackson isnt a coach, somebody who might have adapted a time or two winning championships with centers as disparate as Shaquille ONeal and Luc Longley. Instead, he seems to be regarded as some type of animatronic matrix who must have the perfect players to plug into his system. The notion that Jackson would not have adapted his offense to suit the talents of Steve Nash by far the truest point guard he would have coached is hard to fathom because Jacksons system isnt so much about the triangle as it is about giving his players the confidence (and freedom) to figure out problems as they present themselves on the court. Its about adapting Thats his theory, his philosophies, things that he lives by, Bryant said. Its the whole Zen master thing. He really believes in letting things unfold, allowing players to develop, allowing the team to kind of grow into their identity, for guys to communicate with each other and be able to adapt on the fly with each other and removing himself from the equation, which I think is part of the mastery of what he has done. Bryant joked that he is the Baby Zen Master, having gleaned so much from playing under Jackson. He even went so far to admit that he probably would not have five championship rings if he had not played for Jackson. The value of the right coach could be seen at the end of the night. When the Spurs got the ball with 19.9 seconds left, trailing by a point, they called timeout. For all the Spurs options, they ran Danny Green Danny Green! off a pick like he was Reggie Miller. Bryant got lost and Green sank a 3-pointer with 9.3 seconds left. The Lakers answered by trying to inbound the ball to Bryant. He was cut off, predictably, so Metta World Peace dumped it to Pau Gasol in the corner. Trapped and with the clock winding down, Gasol launched a 3-pointer. It missed and the Spurs won. Popovich won that game, World Peace said, shaking his head. Its not (Manu) Ginobli, not Tony (Parker), not Tim (Duncan). It is why the Spurs are perennial contenders and have won four titles under Popovich. He feeds players confidence and puts them in a position to succeed, not simply the stars, but the players like Green. This is something that Bryant hit upon in talking about Jackson, and it applies to select others like Popovich, Rick Adelman, Rick Carlisle, Doc Rivers and DAntoni, who made a phenomenon out of Jeremy Lin. Whether DAntoni, who has never reached the Finals before, can make these pieces mesh well enough to win a title will be the question that begins to be answered in the coming days. Meanwhile, there is a man with many answers who sits at home, idled not so much by choice, but by circumstance. Why? That may be the most vexing Zen riddle of all.",Raw Data

391,"LOS ANGELES: The Los Angeles Clippers shot 77 percent and scored 46 points in the first quarter, then lost their killer instinct but still led all the way in earning their third-straight NBA victory, 106-96 over the Houston Rockets Wednesday. Caron Butler scored 17 of his 19 points in the opening quarter for Los Angeles. Blake Griffin had 20 points and 11 rebounds, Chauncey Billups had 19 points, and Chris Paul had 10 points and 11 assists as the Clippers started all their regulars again after the lineup had been hit by injuries during their recent Grammy road trip. “We played great and got a little complacent with the lead,” Billups said. “We’ve shown to lose our discipline sometimes.” Chandler Parsons scored 17 points, Jeremy Lin added 14 points and James Anderson had a season-high 14 for the Rockets, who have lost five straight to the Clippers. “They came out on fire and we didn’t do a good job of making it difficult for them,” Lin said. “Once they got in a rhythm, it just kind of snowballed.” Lin was set to have an X-ray on his right wrist after a fall in the second. “I think it’s fine. It just hurts,” he said. In other games, the San Antonio Spurs beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 96 95 for their 14th win in 15 games, the Toronto Raptors won their fourth straight at the expense of the New York Knicks, 92-88, and Vince Carter passed Larry Bird on the all-time scoring list as the Dallas Mavericks beat the Sacramento Kings 123-100. Kawhi Leonard made a 3-pointer with 2.9 seconds remaining for visiting San Antonio to edge Cleveland. The Spurs had stars Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili on the floor together for the first time since Jan. 13. Parker led the Spurs with 24 points. Duncan, who had missed eight of the last nine games with a sore left knee, scored 13 points in 25 minutes. Ginobili had five points in nine minutes off the bench after missing nine of the last 13 games with a tight left hamstring. Reserve Alan Anderson’s 26 point total was one of the few good offensive performances for either Toronto or New York at Madison Square Garden. Teammate DeMar DeRozan added 20 points for the Raptors, who overcame a four-for-21 performance from Rudy Gay because Knicks star Carmelo Anthony was just as bad. Anthony finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds but shot five of 24 for the Knicks, who dropped their final two games leading into the All-Star break. J.R. Smith led the Knicks with 26 points. Carter scored 17 of Dallas’ last 21 points in the third quarter to help turn aside a Sacramento rally. He made five of seven 3-pointers in the quarter and ended the night with 26 and 21,796 career points for 29th on the all-time list. Bird had 21,791. The Kings lost their 18th regular season game in a row in Dallas. The Brooklyn Nets scored a season-high total in beating the Denver Nuggets 119-108, Paul George posted his first career triple-double with 23 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high 12 assists as Indiana snapped a two-game skid with a 101-77 win over Charlotte, and the Atlanta Hawks blew away the Orlando Magic 108-76 for their ninth consecutive regular-season win over their division rivals. Boston overcame poor shooting – less than 37 percent – to beat Chicago 71-69, Detroit defeated Washington 96-85, Milwaukee came back in the fourth quarter to top Philadelphia 94-92, Utah beat Minnesota 97-93, and New Orleans handed Portland a fifth-straight loss, 99-63.

393,"Before playing Manchester United earlier this month, Brendan Rodgers talked about how he had restored some value to Jordan Henderson, Jose Enrique and Stewart Downing. In fairness to Liverpool's manager, even his archest critics would have to agree that each has been much improved of late - even if the Rodgers spiel smacked of more than a little self-promotion. So what could be behind the changes that have left all three players looking, well, decent? Perhaps it was an encouraging arm round the shoulder from the gaffer or even fear of Brendan's sinister Derren Brown envelopes that has brought about the improvement. Or maybe the impending transfer window helped focus the players' minds. Perhaps it was a combination of all of these things - or none of them at all. It could simply be that each has just settled down to life at Anfield and found their feet. But there is another interesting possibility - Brendan Rodgers' decision to hire the man they call the 'brain mechanic', Dr Steve Peters, at the tail end of November. Some of you will have recognised the name immediately. For those who are unfamiliar with the good doctor, Peters is the sports psychiatrist who was seen as central to the overwhelming success of the British Cycling squad in recent years. When plotting the road to success for the cyclists, their lauded manager Dave Brailsford sought to assemble a team of experts not just to manage the athletes - but to support them in every conceivable way, both mental and physical. Brailsford is a great believer in the idea that a focus on small details can bring numerous incremental gains, the kinds of gains that can make the difference in top level sport. Peters was headhunted to strengthen the 'mental architecture' of the likes of Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, and if their testimony is anything to go by, he succeeded in furnishing them with a critical mental edge. Brendan Rodgers holds similar beliefs to Brailsford - and without the money to compete in the transfer market with the league's big guns, feels he must explore other ways to chip away at their advantage. In making the appointment, the Liverpool manager explained that with so much emphasis in football being placed on technical, tactical and physical training, the mental side of things can be ignored. Peters has been hired to address this issue. As a psychiatrist, he will delve deeper than the sports psychologists that are now commonly used by football clubs and do more than just coach positive thinking techniques. Peters focuses on identifying flaws in an athlete's mental architecture, flaws that when the pressure is on will undermine any positive thinking technique and inhibit the athlete's performance. The brain mechanic offers an enabling approach that helps athletes manage the way they operate under pressure, with the emphasis on differentiating between emotional and logical thinking. The logical part of the brain, according to Peters, is what an athlete must access to enhance performance; the emotional, irrational part of the brain, the source of doubts that foster inhibition and cloud decision making, must be switched off. Definitively ascertaining whether an athlete's performance is improving because of psychiatric consultation is extremely difficult - something Peters freely admitted to Brailsford when initially asked to work with the cycling squad. But according to Peters (in an interview for the Leaders in Performance organisation last year) Brailsford ""accepted that while some things can't be measured, you can still recognise the outcomes. That outcome may not be directly attributable to the psych work but it correlates with it. In other words when you start seeing trends and correlations, it's clear that it's working"". Could this explain the improvement we are seeing in Henderson, Downing, Enrqiue - and even in Joe Cole (now back at West Ham)? Henderson's brilliant goal and Downing's wonderful assist in Saturday's thrashing of Norwich are obvious examples of growing confidence. But pehaps the longer-term trend has been a discernible change in attitude in both players. For far too long, both played in fear - concerned about abuse from the stands, they kept things simple, did everything easy, kept the ball red. But neither was really impacting the game - neither was doing what they were bought to do. Downing's inhibitions became all the more glaring when you compared his efforts to the fearless, positive play of Raheem Sterling. But in recent months, you can see a change, most marked in the willingness of both players to try things, to be positive, to affect the game. Are these the kinds of outcomes that Peters talked about with Brailsford? Who knows for sure - but there is a correlation, at least in terms of time, with Peters' appointment by Rodgers and the improved form of the two England internationals (and cole and Enrique). If Peters had not gained renown with the all-conquering cycling team, his appointment might just be seen as more hocus-pocus from Rodgers. But given his reputation, the man who earlier in his career spent 12 years working to make dangerous psychotics less of a threat to society, might well be at least partly responsible for making Downing and Henderson more of a menace to Premier League opponents.",Raw Data
394,"Where Do You Hate Going? Seeing as its a Friday... It's Scottish League Cup semi-final weekend (stop laughing!) which this year means a trip to Hampden for St Mirren and Celtic. The discussion in the office concluded that everyone hates going to Hampden. The combination of bad view, terrible location and general rubbishness was echoed by all parties. With this in mind, my question to the esteemed contributors is - Which (rival) ground do you dislike visiting the most? And why? Craig ( this trips to hampden for league game are particularly bad) RFC Glasgow What Happened To Bacary Sagna? Re. Hoges email about Sagna's ability to repel the ball before it's passed to him. Granted, Arsenal have been generally sloppy this season, but to blame their passing in general on his absolutely shocking form is just wrong. I've never seen a player become so crap so quickly in such a short space of time. He can't control the ball. His crossing is woeful, just terribly bad. He's forgotten how to tackle. I'm surprised he can still remember how to run. By far, the stand out worst performer for Arsenal this season. I don't know what's wrong with him. Maybe he's lost his heart, or he's just turned crap. Either way, I'm past caring now. Thanks for your services. Please leave this summer and make way for Jenkinson. Kiraldo (and I was annoyed with him when he decided to leave my FIFA team a few months back).... What Makes A Good Goalie? Watching that Scott Carson howler will bring back some really bad memories for Baggies fans. Carson was perhaps one the worst goalkeepers to ever grace the Premier League. In nearly 3 years at the Albion he made one memorable save (in a 2-1 win against Liverpool) and gave a goal away nearly every week. So many times I have I witnessed him standing there with his hands on his hips looking mystified as he has thrown yet another goal into his net. He used to make me so angry and I am glad he is safely locked away in Turkey and that we now have the fabulous Ben Foster. He is fabulous. Truly tremendous. However the fact that Carson was ever allowed to become a professional just shows how little is known about what makes a good goalkeeper. De Gea is a case in point. Any fool can make the odd tremendous save by throwing their body around. Good goalkeeping is all about technique. Since January how many goals have Man Utd conceeded where De Gea has parried directly out to a striker. Getting to the ball anybody can do, disposing of it safely i.e. to the side requires technique. De Gea is not and never will be a good goalkeeper just like Carson because ultimately they have no technique. David Seaman was a brilliant goalkeeper. More often than not he did not need to make a brilliant saves because his technique and positioning was so good that he was in the right place. Yes there were a couple of errors (Nayim & Ronaldinho) but even the best will get it wrong occasionally. Joe Hart is a quality goalkeeper and yes his arrogance may have led to a couple of errors this season. But, a good keeper must be arrogant, to be able to stay calm, hold the ball and have the belief that if they come off their line they are going to get the ball. There is way to much ignorance even from the media about goalkeeping. The wrong skills have been valued. Best goalkeepers I have seen: Russell Hoult, David Seaman, Ben Foster, Jussi Jasskeleinen, Brad Friedel, Petr Cech, Andy Goram, Shay Given,Nigel Martyn. All a certain type and please do notice why I left Schmeichal off that list. Overrated and actually has a lot to answer for with standard of many current goalkeepers. Even Schmeichal fans would describe him as un-orthodox.Well a good keeper can't be un-orthodox because good keeping is about technique. Schmeichal was lucky to play with people Gary Neville who were always there to whack the ball away after it had bounced randomly off him. Kasey Keller who was a far better keeper, would make save after save only for one to bounce off him and for no defender to be there to clear. If Schmeichal would have played for Leicester or Southampton he would have been found out for the sub par keeper he really was. Ben (I could have included Alan Miller and Stuart Naylor in my good keeper list) Baggie. Still laughing at the Villa. Zaha: Not The Man? I'd rather have bought Isco or James Rodriguez. Even Viktor Fischer or Alen Halilovic, if real youth were required. Hate to say it, but Zaha looks an awful lot like a cheap-and-cheerful version of a Champions League quality attacking midfielder. Chris MUFC Wet Tuesday On a similar theme to Jack in Manchester about Berbaflop on the BBC, I'd advise people to take great care with spreading Football365 and football forum culture to the outside world. Last year, against my better judgement, I ventured on to the Daily Mail website to read a heartwarming story about a girl with no legs, who bravely battled back against illness to gain a place on her school football team. In the comments section, I asked the question I presumed would have been on everyone's lips: ""A truly inspirational story, but could she do it on a wet Tuesday night at Stoke?"" Hundreds red arrows and messages of hate followed. Most probably all deserved. Jamie (Never Again) Doherty Pop Dear TJ. I hate to point out the obvious but yes, Arsenal have underperformed over the past eight years or so and yes our former players have gone on to win stuff with other clubs. You may have missed this but Arsenal have a bloody great stadium to pay for. We have a stadium to pay for and have a debt but then so do United and every season we are farther down the road of clearing that date so I'm afraid there's bugger all chance of Wilshere following so called Arsenal fan Robin Van Persie. Sorry to burst your bubble Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London Berbaflop Earliest reference I can find to Berbaflop was a Spurs fan http://spurs.theoffside.com/team-news/dimitar-berbatov-you-prick.html (understandably) annoyed after a summer of Berbatov batting eyes and making pretty at potential suitors. More interesting was Jol's quote in the piece ""Gifted, yes. But he is not a fighter. Perhaps you need others who are fighters to balance out the team""... Astute observation from the Dutchman. Sam (wishes we'd have spent the 30m on Bale), Sydney Flop Flop Mike, Chelsea, based in Auckland you're wrong about a lot of those players. I'd love to know what you're criteria for success of flop is because frankly I find the following from your list of flops a bit puzzling; Pogba young player who left the league to get more regular football hardly a glittering failure, Deschamps 1 year at the end of his career won an FA Cup wouldn't call him a resounding failure, Barthez 2 Premier Leagues in four years and overall some good performances while the United GK jersey was still a poisoned chalice from memories of Schmeichel, Dacourt was a fans favourite at Leeds where his performances established him the French team and only left because of a falling out with Venables, Koscielny inconsistent yes and prone to brain farts but he has had a good Premier League so far I could question a few other 'flops' you've listed based on age, your clear dislike of Arsenal players. I would question however why the players I've listed above are considered flops as opposed to players like Franc Quedrue (mid table journey man), Giles Grimandi (pretty average) Flamini (one really good season) who are 'hits'. If you're going to list off who's been a success or not gage how long they lasted, the level they played at or the trophies they won. Don't just base their success in the English game on whether you like them or not. Oh and Stphane Sessegnon is from Benin. Not born there and plays for France. Was born in Benin and plays for Benin. You could have at least bothered your hole paying attention to the nationality listing seeing as you were on Wikipedia any way instead of lazily going with 'sounds French must be French'. You said your selection was biased but forgot to forewarn us it was idiotic . On a constructive note if we're going to base this on success rate then the best contenders are countries with relatively few. Here's some of the best (success rate in brackets are surely) Zimbabwe (100%); Benjani Mwaruwari, Bruce Grobbelaar, Peter Ndlovu Oman (100%); Ali Al Habsi Admin Just a small, pedantic point, in response to MagnumPIG (10m on Coutinho is a waste however) The reason the likes of Benfica and Porto pick up steals from South America and sell them on for huge profits is probably actually to do with work permit regulations. Exciting stuff huh? In short, our regulations here are much stricter than in some other European countries. Another mailboxer may be able to tidy this up with exact figures, but I believe that for someone outside the EU to qualify for a work permit, they need to have played in a certain number of internationals, or an 'exceptional case' may be made for a player on appeal, usually involving a manager appearing before the Depratment for Work and Pensions, dropping to his knees and begging. In Portugal, these rules are a lot looser, and the presence of a Portuguse great great grandparent may help swing it too. I think British clubs know about some of these players, but the combination of language, culture and immigration rules mean Portugal (and Holland) are seen as better proving grounds for young South American talent before they take the next step to the 'big leagues'. Conrad Wiacek, MUFC The Spectacle Adam Shortland. It costs a significant amount of money to televise a football match, and typically television execs., sponsors, clubs, players, et al. all want to achieve the highest possible ratings, and present the best possible spectacle, when a match is televised. Unfortunately, in a milieu in which the FA Cup is widely broadcast abroad (no idea why, it's a joke of competition), that therefore guarantees that matches including United/Chelsea/Arsenal/City etc., particularly when against decent PL opposition, will be televised. It's in the interests of all concerned parties, and present a much better advert for English football than watching a lower league team defend desperately, hoof the ball, and try and score a scrappy goal, on a crap pitch against superior opposition. Chris MUFC ...Could Adam Shortland in this morning's mailbox please let me know how to watch the Arsenal game this weekend, cos I'm pretty bloody sure it's not on telly. It's also a potential cup upset, which simultaneously backs-up and destroys his argument: if it was on telly it would be the kind of banana-skin tie he wants to watch. But it's not. Steve Owen ...I agree with Adam Shortland about televised FA Cup matches. Man United have had their last 37 FA Cup ties televised. Yep, 37. In a row. This weekend makes it 38. Even as a Liverpool fan, this is in no way the fault of United, but of the appeal to the masses scheduling methodology. Broadcasters bang on about, ""The magic of the cup"" yet refuse to show it.

Afew years ago my favourite great uncle passed away, and had the brainwave of making me executor of his estate because he deemed me to be the next 'man of the family'...being only in my twenties, when it came time to go through probate, I found myself attending the meetings with my mum as she had a clue what it was all about, and i was the obvious clueless idiot... Being in Manchester city centre early on the day all the forms were being finalised, we decided to pop for a coffee in one of those 'poncey sofas n armchairs style rip off coffee establishments'. While mum settled her arse in a purple Chesterfield, I did the honours and got mugged for 2 mochas. While stood there all suited n booted with the added suave of black leather jacket (not my usual daytime attire so was feeling unusually cool), I noticed my mam pissing herself in the corner. Once coffees were purchased and my wallet suitably lightened I went to find out what the joy was about on this sombre day. Turns out she'd been observing some poor woman wandering past, spot me from behind in the queue, freeze, dive into her bag for her phone and ring her fella/dad/son/male friend. Through the medium of lip reading mum observed this conversation... 'Hi it's me, no no shush listen. I'm on Deansgate n I've just seen ******* ****** in a coffee shop, I'm looking at him now...no honest I am!!...OK, what shall I say?...OK, yes I've got a pen...ok I'll ask...yes it's definately him!!...OK I'll ring you back.' Blissfully unaware I'm still queueing for my expensive hot chocolate, apparently she got through the door and within a few steps of nervously tapping me on the shoulder, then I stepped forward and placed my order. Apparently the realisation of my mancunian accent not bring the expected French stopped her from actually making me aware she was stalking me for an autograph...the moment of my half turn, to look at mum laughing she retreated,silently, with a face turning beetroot and quickly scurried off outside...I sauntered over to have my cool destroyed forever, my mum was laughing because I'd been mistaken, from behind in my defence, for the handsome ladykiller that is....

395,"Last August, the 30-year-old Chinese star hired Rodriguez, who coached Justine Henin to seven Grand Slam titles, after the conflicts with her previous coach - her husband Jiang Shan - became too much to bear. ''The funny thing is, I think two years ago in China, someone said I was divorced,'' Li said Tuesday after beating Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska 7-5, 6-3 to advance to the semifinals of the Australian Open against Maria Sharapova. ''Because they were thinking, we're always shouting, maybe we're divorced.'' ''It's just being coach and husband is - how you say - tough to find a balance!'' she added. Now Li and Jiang have found marital peace again - fewer disagreements on or off the court - and she is winning again. Li hired Rodriguez after disappointing, early-round losses at Wimbledon and the London Olympics. He joined her midweek at a tournament in Cincinnati - they had never even met before - and she captured the title, her first since her breakthrough Grand Slam win at Roland Garros in 2011. She then won a second title at the inaugural Shenzhen Open earlier this month and is now in the semifinals of the Australian Open for the third time in four years. Rodriguez has had a steadying influence on Li, who had previously struggled to control her emotions on court and has appeared more composed since starting to work with him. At one point during the second set against Radwanska, Li lost her service toss in the sun and batted the ball five rows deep into the crowd. Rather than let the miss-hit unnerve her, however, she calmly made her second serve and put away a deft backhand volley to win the point. ''I was working a lot on this (aspect) in winter training,'' Li said. ''Carlos always say, `Calm down, calm down.''' In interviews, she seems happier as well. Two years ago, on her way to becoming the first Chinese player to reach a Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, Li was pure entertainment in her press conferences, joking about her husband's snoring and admitting she forget her own wedding anniversary. After her win at the French Open, however, things changed. She began to put more pressure on herself at the Grand Slams - and didn't make a quarterfinal at six consecutive majors. At last year's Australian Open, she left in tears after wasting four match points in the fourth round against Kim Clijsters. On Tuesday, Li said she was still thinking about those match points a year later during her third-round match against Romanian Sorana Cirstea. ''When I was playing Cirstea in Rod Laver, I was thinking about the match last year. It's something you couldn't forget. Always in your mind,'' she said. This year, though, she says she is more relaxed - and she's back to her humorous self. When asked during her post-match interview what happened with that very wayward serve, she quipped: ''I want to have good communication with the fans.'' Then she said to her coach, ''Carlos, make sure we practice on serve.'' Later, Li related the difficulties she had when she started training with Rodriguez at the Spaniard's tennis academy in Beijing. After three days of six-hour workouts, she called her husband in distress. ''After three days, I was dying. Because my husband didn't come with me to Beijing, I called him and said, `Carlos is crazy,''' she said. Jiang didn't believe her so he came to Beijing to see for himself. ''I was doing some exercises with Carlos. (Jiang) was sitting in the gym,'' Li said. ''After I was halfway done, he was like `Are you finished?' I said, `No, only halfway.' ''He said, `I'm tired!' I said, `Don't say that, I'm doing exercises, you're only sitting. Don't say you're tired.''' Li admits now the hard work was worth it. Her fitness was tested against the fourth-seeded Radwanska, a crafty player who relies on spins and slices to construct points and wears her opponents down with her consistency. Radwanska tried to dictate play by moving Li around the court, but the Chinese sixth seed countered with deep, heavy groundstrokes and superb volleying, winning 20 of 24 points at net. ''Some of the games she didn't let me do anything,'' Radwanska said after the match. ''I think she's a very consistent player. She's always playing on the same level. It's not like up and down like the other girls.'' Li will next play No. 2-ranked Sharapova, who said she can also see a difference in Li's game since she's been working with Rodriguez. ''She's a Grand Slam champion. It wasn't like she needed someone to come in and fix her game,'' she said. ''But sometimes when you just have a different surrounding and a new voice, they might be saying the same things but it just gets to you a little bit differently and your motivation changes.'' Li knows she will have to be sharp against Sharapova - the Russian won the three matches they played last year and owns an 8-4 head-to-head record against Li. But she believes she's a stronger player this year. ''I'm getting a little bit older, getting more experience,'' Li said. ''Right now, I really enjoy every match.''",Raw Data
396,"﻿Wolfpack's Lorenzo Brown out in front Lorenzo Brown makes his impact felt all over the court for NC State. Saturday night wasn't exactly a typical night for North Carolina State's basketball team. The Wolfpack made another statement about the order of things along Tobacco Road, firmly planting their relevance smack dab into the middle of the lane Duke and North Carolina have traveled for decades. In one particular area, however, the Wolfpack jumped out in front of the Blue Devils, Tar Heels and everyone else in the ACC. Junior point guard Lorenzo Brown is now the front-runner for ACC Player of the Year. He had been trending that way going well back into December, and after Saturday night's 20-point, 11-assist performance in a 91-83 romp over the visiting Tar Heels, Brown is now a full length ahead of anyone else. ""He was great again,"" senior forward Richard Howell said about Brown. ""But he's been great all year. We know what he can do and we know every game he's gonna do it."" Brown is second on the Wolfpack (16-4, 5-2 ACC) in scoring at 13.2 points per game, leads the ACC with 7.2 assists and is averaging 4.4 rebounds per contest. In addition, the 6-foot-5 combo guard-turned playmaker swipes more than two steals per outing, so he's getting it done on both ends of the court. On Saturday, Brown put on a clinic in how to operate in the open court against a program most defined by running efficient and entertaining fast breaks. In the first half alone, NC State put 20 fast-break points on the board to the Tar Heels' zero. For the game, NCSU registered 39 such points, and Brown's DNA was all over the Pack's output. From wrap-around and behind-the-back passes to b-lines right to the rim, the Roswell, Ga., native put on a show. But he said the highlight reel stuff began on the defensive end, and keeping UNC from churning its wheels. ""It was very big to contain those guys on the fast-break point,"" Brown said. ""But we're used to it because we run the same type of offense. We run it every day in practice."" Brown's defense on UNC freshman guard Marcus Paige was so thoroughly dominating that at one point in the second half, Carolina coach Roy Williams dug well into his bench and played seldom-used guard Luke Davis in place of Paige for a six-minute stretch. At that point, Paige was 0 for 8 from the field with three turnovers. One came when he simply lost control of his dribble near mid-court and the ball bounced into the backcourt for a violation with Brown applying no physical pressure. Brown's effect also was in the form of perimeter shooting, where he drained both 3-point attempts, and at the charity stripe, where he was 6 for 6. And demonstrating the importance of beating the Tar Heels and opening up a 28-point lead at one point in the second half, Brown even let loose about a half-dozen smiles during the game. Given that his only facial expression in a victory over Duke two weeks ago came with 28 seconds remaining indicates how he must have felt inside over his own performance and for the Wolfpack finally knocking the Tar Heels from their perch. ""Since I've been here, we've got a beat down,"" Brown said, referring to having never beaten UNC. ""I'm just proud of my guys. We work hard and it's paying off."" The Wolfpack failed to back up their win over Duke with a victory in their next game, falling by a point at Maryland. Now they hit the road again, visiting a quality Virginia club Tuesday night. The deliberate Cavaliers defend as well as anyone in the ACC and present a significant challenge to NC State. To keep the fire of beating UNC stoked, the Wolfpack must meet the challenge. ""Staying focused,"" Brown said is the key to beating Virginia. ""We have to do that. We go to Virginia, and they are a good shooting team. We have to stop them from shooting the 3."" With Brown doing his thing, NC State's chances are pretty good to beat Virginia and anyone else the Wolfpack face.",Raw Data
397,"﻿U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan in New Orleans ruled in favor of Goodell's motion to dismiss Vilma's complaint, which was filed in May and set out 11 claims. Vilma had argued that Goodell made false statements, tarnishing the player's reputation, in connection with the league's investigation of what it determined was a system that offered cash bonuses to Saints players for big hits from 2009-11. ''Even though this matter has been pending only since May ... it feels as protracted and painful as the Saints season itself, and calls for closure,'' Berrigan wrote in her decision. ''The Court nonetheless believes that had this matter been handled in a less heavy handed way, with greater fairness toward the players and the pressures they face, this litigation and the related cases would not have been necessary.'' Goodell initially suspended Vilma for all of the 2012 season - although he wound up being able to play while appealing - and three other players received shorter bans: Saints defensive end Will Smith and two former Saints, Cleveland linebacker Scott Fujita and free agent defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove. But Paul Tagliabue, Goodell's predecessor as commissioner, heard a final round of player appeals and threw out the suspensions last month. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said neither he nor Goodell would have any comment Thursday about Berrigan's ruling. Peter Ginsberg, a lawyer for Vilma, wrote in an email: ''We are obviously disappointed, strongly believe that the CBA does not give anyone - including a commissioner - a license to misrepresent and to manufacture facts, especially at the expense of another person's reputation - and are considering our options.'' Berrigan wrote that ''Vilma maintains that Goodell is responsible for the allegedly offending statements in his individual capacity.'' The judge rejected that as ''unpersuasive,'' saying: ''The Court finds that all of the allegedly offensive statements were made by Goodell as Commissioner of the NFL in conjunction with the investigation resulting in the now well-known discipline against Vilma and others associated with the Saints.'' Vilma's lawsuit pointed to six statements made by Goodell - including in NFL news releases, memos to the league's 32 teams, and an interview with the NFL Network. ''While the Court is extremely disturbed by the fundamental lack of due process in Goodell's denying the players the identities of and the right to confront their accusers, that was substantially rectified later in the process,'' Berrigan wrote. ''So while the process was initially procedurally flawed, the statements were ultimately found to have enough support to defeat the defamation claims.''",Raw Data
398,"As the only driver to ever win the Daytona 500, the Indianapolis 500 and the Formula 1 World Driving Championship, Andretti knows all about putting on great performances on big stages. That’s why the trophy for the SPEED Performer of the Year award carries Andretti’s name. And it’s why Andretti wholeheartedly endorses Sebastian Vettel as this year’s recipient. Vettel, 25, a native of Germany in 2012, became only the third man in the 63-year history of Formula One to win three consecutive driving championships. “I think it’s particularly significant since it’s happened at such a young age,” Andretti said of Vettel’s three straight titles. “After he won the first championship, he proved (himself) over and over by winning another one and now, with a third one, it’s so solid that you cannot doubt this man’s special, special skills and talent. It’s absolutely impressive in every way.” Andretti cited Vettel’s resolve after falling to fourth in points after the Grand Prix of Italy, then winning the next four consecutive races to reassert control of the championship. “To me, that’s the mark of a real, real champion,” said Andretti. “He (Vettel) doesn’t give up. He doesn’t look sat the numbers. As long as it’s mathematically possible, he’s going to be in there.” Vettel was selected as the SPEED Performer of the Year from a very deep and talented field that included Ryan Hunter-Reay, Brad Keselowski and Kyle Larson, among others. “Anyone — especially the top five (drivers) — could have been the recipient of this trophy with no doubt, and nobody could have argued,” said Andretti. It was that close.” As for the SPEED Performer of the Year award being the Mario Andretti Trophy, Andretti said, “Obviously, it’s flattering. It’s the ultimate in flattery. To have something that can be so valuable for someone’s career and to have your name on it representing that … I don’t think it gets any better than that. It’s like being inducted into the Hall of Fame.” Tom Jensen is the Editor in Chief of SPEED.com, Senior NASCAR Editor at RACER and a contributing Editor for TruckSeries.com.

399,"Whether the NFL's all-star game will return next season is something the league will ponder the next few months after the NFC's 62-35 blowout of the AFC on Sunday. The NFC's 62 points broke the single-game scoring record of 59, set by the AFC one year before. ''It's been an unbelievable week,'' Seattle rookie quarterback Russell Wilson said. ''And the thing was, if you watched us, everybody was competing today and it was really awesome.'' Wilson at least got the crowd pumped up in the second half with some nifty scrambles and three passing touchdowns. There was also Houston's sack-happy defensive end J.J. Watt going out for a couple of passes as a wide receiver, and retiring Green Bay center Jeff Saturday snapping to two Mannings on opposite teams. But while the NFC appeared unstoppable on offense, with nearly each player putting up fantasy-worthy lines in limited play, the AFC had five turnovers and scored most of its points well after the game was no longer competitive. Minnesota tight end Kyle Rudolph was voted the game's MVP with five catches for 122 yards and a touchdown. ''Guys were competing, guys wanted to win and guys want to keep the game here,'' Rudolph insisted. ''That was the point before the game. We want to keep this game rolling for future Pro Bowlers.'' Watt, who had 20 1/2 sacks for Houston, lined up as a wide receiver on the AFC's third play from scrimmage, but missed a pass from Denver quarterback Peyton Manning. He was targeted one more time, but didn't make a catch. He later showed a television camera a bloody left pinkie, joking with NBC broadcasters that it was proof that the players were trying. ''Hey, Commish, we're playing hard,'' Watt said as he showed his finger. Roger Goodell has said the Pro Bowl won't be played again if play didn't improve this year. Last year, fans in Hawaii booed as lineman were clearly not trying. On one play in that game, Minnesota defensive end Jared Allen did a barrel roll to switch positions with a teammate. If players were coasting this time around, it was less obvious. The AFC just played poorly. And fans didn't boo much; the stands were relatively empty even though the game sold enough tickets to lift a local television blackout. The game was trending on Twitter in the United States early on, but quickly gave way to the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the WWE Royal Rumble. Saturday, retiring at the end of this season, played for both teams, though he came representing the NFC. He lined up on one play for the AFC to snap the ball one last time to Manning, his longtime former Colts teammate. Saturday said it meant a lot to him that the Broncos quarterback, whom Saturday called a true friend, orchestrated the stunt. ''He's got a little more pull than I got,'' Saturday said. ''He got it all set up and timed up for me, so it was really nice of him to do that.'' Saturday played 13 seasons in Indianapolis, all with Manning, except 2011, when Manning was out with a neck injury. Saturday then played later in the game for the NFC, snapping to Peyton's brother, Giants quarterback Eli Manning. Saturday's last play on the field was a passing touchdown by Eli Manning. Peyton Manning said it was nice for the NFL to allow the play to happen. ''It's something that I'll always remember,'' he said, ''that he'll always remember to kind of get that one, final snap together after the thousands that we've taken together.'' Even as the NFC piled up touchdowns, the game struggled for memorable moments after Saturday's momentary switch. In the second quarter, referee Ed Hochuli drew cheers when announcing a pass interference penalty on Denver cornerback Champ Bailey in the second quarter, the first flag of the game. ''Yes, there are penalties in the Pro Bowl,'' Hochuli said, drawing laughs and loud cheers. Giants wideout Victor Cruz broke a Pro Bowl record with 10 catches. Tampa Bay receiver Vincent Jackson had 91 yards and two touchdowns. Eli Manning threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns. Cincinnati's A.J. Green had three TD catches for the AFC. NFL officials said earlier in the week that the league wants to decide the future of the Pro Bowl by the time next season's schedule is released in April. ''We understood exactly what (Goodell) wanted, guys were making plays all over the field,'' Cruz said. ''There was a little bit more high intensity than in years past and we were excited to play.''",Raw Data

401,"Due to the fog that wiped out an entire day of golf, the Farmers Insurance Open was never going to end on Sunday, even though Tiger Woods effectively ended it. Woods walked off Torrey Pines with a six-shot lead and only 11 more holes between him and winning on this course for the eighth time in his pro career. He drove the ball with superb control in the third round on his way to a 3-under 69 to build a four-shot lead after three rounds. He lost control with his driver in the fourth round and still managed three birdies in seven holes. ''All we can do tomorrow is go out and try to make him think about it a little bit and see what happens,'' said Nick Watney, one of two former winners at Torrey Pines who faced the tough task of trying to make up six shots on Woods. The other was defending champion Brandt Snedeker. ''I've got a guy at the top of the leaderboard that doesn't like giving up leads,'' Snedeker said. ''So I have to go catch him.'' Woods was at 17-under par for the tournament and will resume his round on the par-3 eighth hole. Snedeker played 13 holes of the final round. Watney played eight holes. Both were at 11-under par. Woods played 25 holes on Sunday. He started with a two-shot lead and tripled it before darkness suspended the final round. ''It was a long day ... and I played well today,'' Woods said. ''Overall, I'm very pleased that I was able to build on my lead.'' Thick fog washed out all of Saturday, forcing players to go from sunrise to sunset Sunday. They finished the third round, took about 30 minutes for lunch and went right back out. Woods finished 54 holes at 14-under 202 and was four shots ahead of Canadian rookie Brad Fritsch. It was the 16th time in his PGA Tour career that Woods had a 54-hole lead of at least four shots. If that wasn't enough to make the outcome look inevitable, everything was going his way in the final hour. His tee shot was so far left on No. 2 that the ball finished in the first cut of rough in the sixth fairway. He still saved par. Woods made a birdie putt of about 10 feet on No. 3, and then wound up well right of the cart path and blocked by a tree on the fourth hole. He carved a punch shot around the tree, safely in front of the green, and his chip banged into the pin and dropped for birdie. Two holes later, from a mangled lie in the right rough, he smashed a 5-wood that ran onto the green and set up a two-putt birdie. Snedeker was seven shots behind after three rounds, the same deficit he faced a year ago when he stormed home to win. However Woods is 38-2 on the PGA Tour when he has the outright lead going into the last round. ''I've got to make some more birdies,'' Snedeker said. ''I've got a long way to go. I did a great job today of staying patient and playing good golf.'' Fritsch birdied the last hole of the third round for a 70 to finish on 206. Erik Compton finished birdie-eagle for a 71 and was alone in third through 54 holes, five shots behind. When someone asked him about chasing Woods, Compton started laughing. ''I'm trying to chase myself,'' he said. Woods has won seven times at Torrey Pines as a pro, including a U.S. Open, and another win Monday would give him the most wins on any course. He also has seven wins at Bay Hill and Firestone. Sam Snead won the Greater Greensboro Open eight times, but only four times on one course. Woods attributed his lead to ''the whole package.'' ''I've driven the ball well, I've hit my irons well, and I've chipped and putted well,'' he said. ''Well, I've hit good putts. They all haven't gone in.''",Raw Data
402,"BEIRUT: Riyadi Beirut continued their rise in the Lebanese Basketball League with a 94-73 victory over Amchit Friday, for their fourth win on the bounce. The match marked the first appearance for Amchit head coach, Italian Lino Lardo, but he was powerless in preventing his side from another loss. The Jbeil team missed three of their key players – Croatian center Dalibor Bagaric, Ghaleb Reda and Anthony Yamine – and their absence was felt from the beginning as Riyadi led 15-8 in the first quarter. Riyadi had an incredible percentage from beyond the arch in the opening minutes, as they sunk six 3-pointers, including three for Omar Turk, to steal a commanding 13-point lead going into the second, 28-15. Shooting guard Turk, 32 years old, who began the match as a starter, scored 11 points in the first quarter. Coming off the bench, Ahmad Ibrahim continued to run the show for Riyadi as he scored two consecutive 3-pointers to keep them in control. League top scorer Andre Emmett was certainly in the wars for Amchit as his side never looked in the contest. Ismail Ahmad continued his side’s dominance in the second quarter as he helped build on Riyadi’s advantage. The Egyptian star would eventually end the match with a double-double 10 points and 12 assists, along with seven rebounds. With a 53-32 halftime scoreline it looked as though Riyadi were on course for a routine fourth straight win. Things didn’t change much in the third with Riyadi keeping their upper hand, but despite Amchit edging the quarter 20-18, the hosts led 71-52 heading into the final period. The visitors started better early on in the fourth, but they were denied quickly with two back-to-back 3-pointers through Turk and Wael Arakji. Despite a poor first half from his side, Emmett clearly wanted to leave his mark on the game. He registered a game-high 32 but, despite that, Amchit ultimately fell short. The match ended 94-73, as Riyadi improved their record to 11-2 in second place. While, Amchit were dealt with their fourth successive loss at 8-6 in fifth place. Turk top scored for the winners with 22 points, while Abdelnour added 19 points and six rebounds, and Ibrahim contributed with 17 points. Alongside Emmett, Matt Freije and Sabah Khoury scored 14 and 13 points respectively for Amchit. Elsewhere, Byblos travel to Sagesse Saturday, knowing they will face a battle in their round 15 tie at Ghazir. In their previous match, Sagesse needed double overtime to overcome Byblos away from home, 123-115. Sagesse are currently in pole position with a 12-2 record and have been unbeaten at home thus far this season. Meanwhile, Byblos are currently in sixth place at 8-5 after the team were dealt another heartbreaking loss against Champville after overtime 93-86 midweek. Although the Jbeil side haven’t been able to beat the top three teams yet, four of their five losses came after being ahead. On Sunday, Champville look to extend their winning streak to eight when they host Tripoli side Mouttahed at Dik al-Mehdi. The defending champions will also aim to avenge their first leg loss 81-73, having been unbeaten in seven games. They currently sit in third place with 10-4.

403,"Taking the plunge Vikings' Rudolph takes home Pro Bowl MVP Minnesota's Kyle Rudolph had five receptions for 122 yards and a touchdown Sunday to take home MVP honors in the NFL's Pro Bowl. (Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports) Shortly before halftime Sunday Kyle Rudolph cradled a lofted touchdown pass to the corner of the end zone. A couple hours later, Rudolph got his hands on a Pro Bowl MVP trophy. Rudolph highlighted the Minnesota Vikings contingent's night at the NFL's Pro Bowl Sunday, as he hauled in five receptions for 122 yards and one score to earn the game's top individual honor, leading the NFC to a 62-35 win over the AFC. ""Guys were competing, guys wanted to win and guys want to keep the game here (in Hawaii),"" Rudolph insisted afterward. ""That was the point before the game. We want to keep this game rolling for future Pro Bowlers."" The Vikings' fun in the sun this week was exemplified best with 7 minutes, 55 seconds remaining in Sunday's game. At that moment, Minnesota fullback Jerome Felton dove in for a short touchdown run behind a block from Vikings teammate Matt Kalil. Minnesota's rookie kicker, Blair Walsh, then tacked on the extra point, handing the NFC a decisive 62-28 advantage. A glance at the Vikings' individual stats in Sunday's Pro Bowl shows more Minnesotans than just Rudolph held their own. Felton had 18 rushing yards to go along with his short scoring run. Peterson had five carries for 13 yards. Walsh totaled 14 points and went 2-for-2 on field goals, including a 48-yarder. Linebacker Chad Greenway was credited with two tackles and a fumble recovery. Allen was credited with one tackle for the NFC. Even as the NFC piled up touchdowns, the game struggled for memorable moments otherwise. Giants wideout Victor Cruz, however, broke a Pro Bowl record with 10 catches. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Raw Data
404,"''It was a huge step,'' Galloway said, with an emphasis on ''huge,'' after the Explorers beat No. 19 VCU 69-61, giving them consecutive wins against ranked teams for the first time in more than 60 years. ''The biggest step probably in La Salle program history.'' Coach John Giannini interrupted with a laugh at that point, noting that La Salle won the national championship (in 1954), but the point was made, and Galloway and his coach insisted that they are part of a changing of the way La Salle is perceived. `We don't want to have a mindset of upsetting teams. We want to have a mindset of beating teams,'' Galloway said. Galloway scored 31 points, 12 during an 18-4 run in the second half Saturday night, and La Salle turned back a late rally by the Rams to follow up a dramatic, one-point victory on Wednesday night against No. 9 Butler with another one. The upstart Explorers (14-5, 4-2 Atlantic 10), who last beat ranked teams consecutively in the 1952 NIT tournament, when they beat three in a row, are off to their best start since the 1990-91 team started the year 14-4. Just don't expect them to act like they didn't expect it. ''If you think we're surprised, you're nuts!'' the animated Giannini snapped at one point, citing the Explorers' 21 wins last year, and a victory in November against Villanova. ''You know nothing about our program and our players if you think we're surprised about winning against a good team. ... We don't care what anyone says or writes. We don't read articles.'' Juvonte Reddic had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Rams (16-5, 4-2), who lost for the second time in three days after a 13-game winning streak. VCU blew a 7-point lead in the last minute and lost in overtime at Richmond on Thursday. Treveon Graham added 13 points and 12 rebounds, but shot just 4 for 17. The Rams appeared poised to get back on the winning track when they opened the second half with 17 consecutive points, but the Explorers responded in a streaky game of shifting momentum. Just as quick as VCU and with experienced guards, La Salle did it by attacking on offense. ''It takes a lot of poise and confidence and guts to withstand that against a good team and in such an emotional atmosphere,'' Giannini said. Trailing 45-38, the Explorers got a driving basket from Galloway, and a 10-footer from Tyrone Garland. Galloway scored again on a driving bucket, and after Reddic made a free throw, Tyreek Duren hit a pair of free throws. Garland then scored and Galloway had a 3-pointer, a jumper and another 3-pointer. That gave La Salle a 53-47 lead, and VCU rallied to 56-55 with 2:50 remaining. Two of the baskets came from Rams scoring leader Treveon Graham, who missed 12 of his first 13 field goal attempts, and a sellout crowd at the Siegel Center rose expecting a stirring, victorious finish. But Galloway hit a pair of free throws, Reddic threw a pass away at the other end and Duren drove for a layup after the Explorers burned plenty of time off the clock, restoring the lead to 60-55. The Rams never got closer than four again. ''We knew their guards were going to attack, one on one,'' Theus said, adding that coach Shaka Smart pounded the thought into their heads during their short preparation. ''We've just got to guard the ball and we did a poor job of that today.'' Whether it's the history of Allen Fieldhouse or the frenzy of Cameron Indoor, college basketball boasts many distinctive arenas. Did your team's home court make the list? Added Smart: ''It's one thing to know it's coming. It's another thing to stop it.'' VCU erased a 34-25 halftime deficit with a burst to start the second half. The Rams forced three early turnovers and scored the first 17 points to take a 42-34 lead, whipping the crowd in a frenzy. But just as quickly, the Explorers came back, eventually handing the Rams just their 29th loss against 173 victories in the 13-year history of the Siegel Center. The first half was all runs, started by VCU when it scored 11 of 13 points to lead 11-8. Duren then scored seven in a 9-0 run for the Explorers, and Reddic then scored the first eight for VCU in a 12-2 burst that gave the Rams a 23-19 lead with 8 minutes left in the half. The Explorers dominated the rest of the way, taking a 34-25 lead into halftime after outscoring VCU 15-2 as Galloway hit two 3-pointers, a long 2-pointer and La Salle got three layups in a row. For the Rams, Reddic and Troy Daniels were 8 for 11 from the field, and the rest of the team was 2 for 22. The Rams finished shooting 38.3 percent (23 of 60), the Explorers 47.1 percent (25 of 51).",Raw Data

He immediately laid out Leconte at courtside and began pumping his chest and checking vital signs, laying ice bags just below his midriff.

406,"A person with knowledge of Cleveland's interest said the team is exploring the possibility of signing Oden, the former No. 1 overall pick whose NBA career has been sabotaged by injuries. The Cavs are doing their due diligence while looking at Oden, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the team's interest is contingent upon the center's health. CBSSports.com first reported the Cavs and Miami Heat were leading the pursuit of Oden, who hasn't played since 2009 and has undergone three microfracture knee surgeries - two on his left knee. Before watching No. 11 Ohio State's 58-49 win over Wisconsin on Tuesday night in Columbus, Ohio, Oden said he hopes to be healthy enough to take another shot at pro ball. ''I don't know when, but I'm taking this year off. I'll play next year,'' said Oden, who led the Buckeyes to the Final Four as a freshman in 2007. Oden's agent, Mike Conley Sr., could not be reached for comment. A defensive force during his one college season, the 7-foot Oden was the first player taken in the 2007 draft by Portland, who chose the soft-spoken big man over All-Star Kevin Durant. Oden was limited to just 82 games with the Trail Blazers, averaging 9.2 points and 7.3 rebounds. Oden has not played since 2009, and he had his last operation on Feb. 20 last year. Portland waived Oden last March, ending a troubled five-year run with a player who entered the league with superstar potential. Any team that signs the 25-year-old Oden would be taking a risk. But for a rebuilding team like the Cavs, who are looking to add pieces around All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving, the possibility Oden could develop into a productive player is enticing. Oden said he has no preference on which team he plays for. ''Right now I'm not worrying about where,'' he said. ''I'm only worried about my knee.''",Raw Data

408,"Around 120,000 people live in St Vincent and the Grenadines. But the small island in the southern Caribbean is currently over-represented on one major stage: the WNBA. The Women’s National Basketball Association has become something of a Caribbean address, highlighted by two Vincentians: Sancho Lyttle and Sophia Young. Lyttle, a native of Kingstown, currently plays for the Atlanta Dream. She has been playing in the Women’s National Basketball Association since 2005, when she was the fifth overall pick of the now-defunct Houston Comets franchise. Young, the fourth overall pick in the 2006 draft after a stellar career at Baylor University, leads the San Antonio Silver Stars, who have already qualified for a playoff berth. “It means a lot to me [to represent St Vincent],” Young tells Caribbean Journal. “I think there’s a lot of girls and boys who are thinking about playing sports, and for us to be doing this and to be an example, and to show them this is possible, it says a lot.” Lyttle (who has acquired Spanish citizenship after playing professionally there), like many in the Caribbean, began her athletic career in track and field — not playing basketball until late in her childhood. “I got a scholarship [from the University of Houston] because of my basketball ability,” she says. “I wasn’t really a basketball player — I used to run track, and got a scholarship.” While track remains dominant in the Caribbean, the region’s basketball culture — particularly for women — is growing, albeit at a slow pace. “I’d say it’s growing, but it’s growing very slowly because of a lack of funds,” Lyttle says. “But countries like this take a long time to develop. And track and soccer are the two main sports in most Caribbean countries — I did track, and it just so happened that I got the opportunity [in basketball].” Young, a three-time WNBA all-star, says basketball has developed more of a following back at home, in the face of competition from track and another sports — netball. “We were trying to start something when I was there — but I think now it has grown bigger and bigger,” she says. “People like Sancho and I, people who have come from our country that have made it to the top level, that has shed a lot of positive light — to see something that girls and boys can be focused on and that the country should pay attention to.”",Raw Data

They’ve lost six games in a row and it feels like the progress we all saw a few weeks ago has been lost. But I loved the quote from coach Frank when he said you’ve kind of got to peel back the onion a little bit. The record is similar to last season, but the results are nowhere near similar. These have been hard-fought, competitive games against rosters stocked with NBA talent. This is a team that’s often ahead, and sometimes by double digits, early on. They just have to figure out what to do in the last five or so minutes to turn these Ls into Ws. You’ve seen teams figure it out. Toronto, for one example. The Raptors are suddenly rolling. Bottom line, they’ve come up with a winning formula and they’re now playing with probably 10 percent more confidence and that makes all the difference in the world. You just can’t go out and manufacture that. It almost has to happen and when good things happen in games and they happen in stretches of games, suddenly a team gets that winning feeling and they know, somehow, in the back of their mind, we can do this and we are going to do it. That’s exactly what the Pistons need right now. They’re not that far away. I feel bad for the guys, but they could win four or five in a row and people would say, the light’s been turned on, and I would agree. Building championships takes time and it has to start somewhere and there have to be some special pieces that come through that pipeline, both early and later on. I don’t think Joe D is nearly finished putting this team together, but when you look at what he’s been able to do the last few years, you have to feel pretty good about where the Pistons are heading. Andre Drummond has become a tremendous offensive rebounder already, despite the fact he’s only 19. He would be the first to admit he still has a lot to learn about playing in the NBA. He’s just the latest piece to the puzzle. Before him, the Pistons added Brandon Knight, who on balance has played extremely well the past few weeks and is really one of the tougher covers in the backcourt in our league because of his range and ability to drive. He can stop in the lane and hit the floater, take it to the rack and shoot with tremendous range. And Greg Monroe, I think, speaks for himself. He played in Toronto the way most centers would like to play every night. I know he wants to get to the point where he’s a threat to score in the middle 30s every night and he’s a lock to score somewhere in the 20s. I think that will happen. He can score with either hand, he’s very creative around the basket and he also knows how to take advantage of a matchup. He proved that last night. When you build through the draft, it really is a fundamentally sound way to do it because it gives you so much time to take a look at these players in all different kinds of situations and certainly the last three draft picks are bona fide NBA players, if not NBA stars, and they all could become that eventually. Then you have a guy like Kyle Singler, who wasn’t a lottery pick but if you had a redraft he would definitely be a solid first-round pick. Kyle’s shown how creative he can be around the basket, he’s a physical defender and he can score from distance. He’s a great competitor and he’ll just never, ever back down. I really like what I’ve seen of Kim English and Khris Middleton, too. They both bring a lot to the table. We haven’t seen a lot of them in games, but we’ve seen them in practice and they can both play. They’ll both be in this league for a long time. And if you watch Slava Kravtsov work before games with Roy Rogers, along with Andre Drummond, he can do everything you want a big man to do. It’s just a matter of time with him and Slava understanding what it’s like to play at this level against this kind of competition. Some European guys don’t miss a beat, but for most it’s a brand new world. I love what I see for the future with this team. In the present, I think the Pistons will start winning games sooner than later. I’d be surprised if by the All-Star break these guys haven’t put together a couple of nice winning streaks and put together a few weeks of plus-.500 basketball. Once that happens, as I said before, confidence is an amazing thing. It’s one thing to have confidence in your own game; it’s another thing to have confidence in your team down the stretch. No matter how unselfish you are, and no matter how much you want to win as a team, you still have to see it unfold before you start making winning plays when you have to. And then it becomes second nature. We saw it with the Bad Boys and we saw it with the Goin’ to Work group. They absolutely knew how to win and were sure they were going to win. When they didn’t, they were surprised. That’s what has to happen here. I’m not saying this team, as it sits right now, is ready to play at that level. But, trust me, it’s a lot closer to being there than it looks like right now. That breakthrough is going to happen. You can feel it coming. George Blaha",Raw Data

412,"Among Lawrence Frank’s trove of favored truisms are these: Players “have never arrived” and teams “never have it figured out.” Then along come games like Monday’s to prove him right. Just when the Pistons might have allowed themselves to believe they’d turned into a well-oiled offensive juggernaut, the struggling New Orleans Hornets locked them in shackles. After a string of impressive offensive performances, the Pistons shot 36 percent and struggled to reach 86 points in losing decisively to the soon-to-be Pelicans. But over the preceding games, the basketball was popping from one side of the court to the other as if it were a game of Pong brought to life. After recording just five games of 25 or more assists in the season’s first 46 games – game 46 coming at Indiana on the night of the three-team trade that brought Jose Calderon to Detroit – the Pistons then recorded five more such games over their next six. If that doesn’t quite constitute hard proof of their increased offensive efficiency, well, men have been convicted on less substantive circumstantial evidence. Not all of the spike can be attributed to Calderon, of course, given that he’s only played the last five games. But his assist-to-turnover ratio is bordering on the spectacular – 5.57 to 1 – with 39 assists against a mere seven turnovers. Frank sees Calderon’s pass-first mentality rubbing off on teammates, too. “I think that’s a big part of it,” Frank said. “Think about the number of times in the Milwaukee game – and he had a hot hand – he passed up shots. All that has a domino effect and that’s huge. Some of the things we’re able to do, it’s because of his ability to look off help, make late passes, and more and more he gets a feel. The more that our guys play with each other and off each other, the better feel he’ll have. But I think a big part of it is Jose’s influence on the team.” The Pistons have also been playing at a faster pace, a predictable outcome after moving the speedy Brandon Knight to shooting guard and Kyle Singler to small forward. Couple those two position shifts with Calderon’s vigilance in looking for every opportunity to push the ball forward in transition and Singler’s unfailing willingness to fill a lane in transition and – presto! – the Pistons have the seeds for a successful transition game that will only get better when Andre Drummond returns as a devastating trailer. The Pistons have averaged 24 assists over the past seven games, a nearly 20 percent increase over their season rate, which was 20.2 prior to the trade. The rise is more dramatic than it might appear. Only one team in the NBA, San Antonio, averages 24 or more assists per game. The last seven games have raised Detroit’s average to 20.6, which ranks 24th. Calderon doesn’t get caught up in numbers, but in the flow an offense creates when the ball starts moving. “It’s just about trusting each other,” he said. “You don’t have to give the assist to a guy, but when you pass the ball once you know that guy is going to pass to you on the next play. It’s not just about making the last play to get the assist in the box score, it’s about passing so the next guy knows you’re going to pass the ball, he’s going to pass it to you and that’s how you make it a little bit easier to play out there – just trying to find the open guy. “Like one coach used to say, ‘See the great pass, but just make the easy one.’ ” Despite playing at a faster pace, the Pistons have also managed to reduce their turnovers. After averaging 15.2 per game over the first 46, they’re at 13.8 over the last seven. So does this seven-game bite represent the direction of the team? “Definitely, with low turnovers, high energy, defensively just getting after it,” said Will Bynum, who has maintained his spot in Frank’s rotation – which has held at eight players, essentially, over the past three games since Drummond’s injury – despite the addition of Calderon. “I think that’s how we have to play and attack. I’m comfortable either way. I’ve played every different style. Best suited for me, the best situation, would be to run and attack, but I understand the game to the point where I can play any kind of way.” The Pistons were likely to play at a slightly faster pace merely for the swapping of Singler in the lineup for Prince. One of Prince’s strengths was to milk possessions and wait for a defense to show its hand before he counterattacked. The Pistons run no plays for Singler, in contrast, yet shots find him because Singler’s constant movement allows him to find open space – and Calderon’s vision figures to mesh well with Singler’s penchant for staying in motion. “Tay’s postups and isolations went down this year compared to year’s prior,” Frank said, taking the conversation back to the Calderon effect. “Especially off pick-and-roll plays, Jose understands all the reads. He gets it. He’s been doing it for a while. He’s able to find guys, whether it’s the late passes, looking off the help, whether it’s one extra dribble or one less dribble, transition – we’re getting more advance passes – and what happens, it’s all a contagious feel. Once you see that ball start moving and you see a guy give up shots, the next guy feels a little more prone to do it was well. If it’s more ‘my turn, your turn,’ it’s very hard to break that habit.” Frank remains rooted on the defensive end, and fretted on Tuesday that the Pistons had allowed three straight opponents to reach triple digits. The good news is the Pistons won two of those games, a firepower they have reason to believe will have some staying power. True Blue Pistons",Raw Data

The biggest lie circulating about Tim Tebow is not that he is selfish. It is that he cannot play. One is at the helm of the biggest hot mess going in the NFL at the moment, and the other has a thing for Tebow that feels almost uncomfortable. Hoge uses whatever Tebow does, from jogging shirtless to eating a hamburger from a non-grass-fed cow, as an opportunity to bash him as a failure without an ounce of football talent. Hoge went all in on this recently, actually calling Tebow a “phony” because of talk he had asked out of a couple of Wildcat plays against San Diego and — insert gasp — asked to play quarterback. Like all things Tebow, this story has been blown into a bunch of reproducing 24-hour news cycles with little actual focus on facts. “I never said, ‘Hey, I don’t want to do anything or I won’t do anything,’ ” Tebow said. “That wasn’t the talk at all. (Ryan) knows that, and everybody on this team knows that. I’d never not done something if I was asked, and I think that’s what’s disappointing about the whole situation, people saying, ‘You quit,’ or ‘You didn’t do this.’ It was not it at all. It was just me asking to get an opportunity to play the position I love.” And this, somehow, is being used to call Tebow selfish. A quick word on what I know to be true about being tagged selfish. The word tends to get thrown around when you are infringing on what another person has or what he wants to have. I also have no doubt Tebow is selfish. Almost every great athlete has some form of selfishness. One of the most selfish individuals I ever covered, Michael Irvin, was also one of the best players, teammates and leaders. He demanded the ball. He always wanted more. He believed in himself. He also went across the middle. He went to the really hard places on the field where he knew he was going to get hit. He came down with almost everything thrown in his direction. He was one of the last guys to leave the practice field. He helped younger guys. Now the question about Tebow is whether he has football greatness in him to justify wanting to play quarterback. Or maybe that is not the question at all. Almost every defense I have read about Tebow rightly focuses on how the Jets screwed him while throwing in a disclaimer about how everybody knows he cannot play. Again I ask: Says who? The last time we saw Tebow on a football field for any real amount of time was in the 2012 playoffs — when he led the Denver Broncos to a win against Pittsburgh and a loss to New England. He did this despite Denver having no real use for him and only grudgingly using him. @merrilhoge Any bronco fan still think they would be better with Tebow? I’ve not heard much noise lately? Curious?? @joshduhamel hey merril. Josh Duhamel here. Wondering why you’re such a jealous bitch about Tebow? He’s 10x the player you were. What does it say about the state of the Tebow discourse that Josh Duhamel, the hot actor who's married to the non-ex-princess Fergie, is the voice of reason in this football discussion? Almost nobody thinks the Broncos are better off with Tebow instead of Peyton Manning. Almost everybody agrees the Jets screwed Tebow. They traded for him apparently for a press conference. They had no intention of playing him at quarterback, or really at all. He was supposed to sit there and be pretty. And now people — Hoge, et al — are acting like Tebow is wrong for being disappointed at being treated like football arm candy and for saying so. He believes he can play quarterback in the NFL. And while Tebow is not Peyton or Tom Brady or even Joe Flacco, he can make a decent case that he deserves a chance ahead of Mark Sanchez. And I am not convinced Tebow cannot play quarterback in this league. I know, I know, Hoge has seen film. We all have seen Tebow throw, his struggles. What I also know was I covered a Cowboys team where coach Bill Parcells tapped Quincy Carter ahead of Chad Hutchinson despite the latter having the prettier throwing motion. What Hutchinson lacked was intangibles, and that mattered to Parcells. He got a QCar-led Cowboys team to the playoffs. Neither was a great quarterback. That is not the point. The point is that no quarterback can succeed when coaches do not believe in him, especially not a singular talent like Tebow. He believes he can play in this league. This does not make him selfish. Hoge and Co. do not believe he can play. And that does not make it so.",Raw Data

415,"﻿ A source told FOXSports.com that Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has hired Andy Heck as his new offensive line coach. Heck, 46, was Jacksonville’s offensive line coach the past seven seasons. He was allowed to leave the Jaguars after Mike Mularkey was fired last week as head coach. The Jaguars enjoyed the three most prolific rushing seasons in franchise history (2006, 2007 and 2010) behind Heck’s offensive line. Maurice Jones-Drew won the NFL’s rushing title in 2011 with a 1,606-yard campaign. A 1989 first-round pick by the Seattle Seahawks, Heck was an NFL tackle for 12 seasons. He also played for the Chicago Bears (1994-98) and Washington Redskins (1999-2000). Heck broke into coaching in 2001 at the University of Virginia. Reid initially appeared set to hire George Warhop as his offensive line coach. Warhop, though, decided to remain with the Cleveland Browns. Feed your NFL addiction! Come feast on all the news in our updating blog. Reid had only two offensive line coaches during his 14-year head coaching tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles — Juan Castillo and Howard Mudd. Castillo shifted to defensive coordinator in 2011 and was fired by Reid midway through last season. Mudd retired following a 4-12 record in 2012 that led to Reid being fired. Reid was then hired days later by the Chiefs, who had fired head coach Romeo Crennel. The offensive line was a major Chiefs’ weakness in 2012 as Kansas City (2-14) finished with the NFL’s worst record. But by landing the No. 1 overall pick in April’s draft, Heck may get the chance to work with a blue-chip offensive lineman. Texas A&M left tackle Luke Joeckel is regarded as the top offensive-line prospect and the potential top selection. The most recent left tackle to get selected at No. 1 was Miami’s Jake Long in 2008.",Raw Data
416,"Has the lockout impacted them more than other teams because their success is predicated on a finely-tuned defensive system that requires practice time? Whatever theory you subscribe to, it's fair to start worrying after Saturday's 4-2 loss to the hated Kings at Jobing.com Arena. The Coyotes are 1-4 and look nothing like the club that captured the Valley's heart during last season's improbable run. Puck management is an ongoing issue, defensive-zone lapses come at inopportune moments, the goaltending has been no better than average and the team is blowing leads more than at any point in Dave Tippett's tenure as coach. ""It's a matter of execution,"" Tippett said. ""It's simple plays that have got to get made. When there is a mistake, you've got to clean up for each other, and right now there's not much cleaning up going on."" Let's be clear. The playoffs have not been lost, despite a league-wide mantra that fast starts would dictate the season. Fast starts may get some teams such as Chicago and San Jose in, but the bulk of the Western Conference has not run away and hidden from the Coyotes just yet. They're just going to have to claw their way in, but that's nothing new. Can they find their mojo in time? That's the greater question. Five of the next six games are at home, so opportunity is still seated at the table. ""It now becomes a matter of will,"" captain Shane Doan said. ""We've been too easy a group to play against in every area of the ice. It's not hard to get to the net, it's not hard to hold onto the puck in our zone, it's not hard to break out of your own zone. When that's the case, it's going to make for a long game."" If you're still hung up on two critical calls in Saturday's loss, you have both an argument and a lingering aftertaste from last season's controversial end against these very Kings. With L.A. up 3-1 in the second period, Coyotes forward David Moss appeared to deflect defenseman Michael Stone's shot past goalie Jonathan Quick to slice the lead in half. But Moss was ruled to have made contact with Quick (who was out of his crease) despite the fact that he was pushed into the goalie by Kings defenseman Alec Martinez. That call wiped out the goal. Then, with Phoenix trailing 4-2 with under a minute to play, Radim Vrbata's shot squirted through Quick's legs and then was whacked into the net, but a quick whistle by the referee nullified that goal, too. The ref apparently lost sight of the puck, although a TV angle clearly showed it in view of him as he blew his whistle. Tippett clearly was miffed with both calls, even noting that Quick did not have possession of Vrbata's shot, but he bit his tongue before risking a fine. ""That's the breaks we're getting right now,"" Tippett said. ""We've got to overcome it."" It was a prudent choice of words from both a financial standpoint and a procedural standpoint. Some breaks are going to go against the Coyotes this season, but they didn't waste time last season lamenting those bad bounces. They dug deeper. Besides, the Coyotes aren't helping themselves with their play. They're allowing four goals a game and committing myriad mental errors that are proving costly. ""It's not who we are as a team, that's for sure,"" Tippett said. ""I like to think we don't beat ourselves much, but that's been the case a few times early here."" There are hockey savants in all corners of North America who are ready to write the Coyotes off as a one-hit wonder -- a nice little story of overachievers who couldn't sustain success. It's up to the team to decide whether those stories ultimately get written. ""One and four is obviously not the start we were looking for,"" goalie Jason LaBarbera said. ""But we have the guys in here to do it. It's just a matter of putting it together and getting on the same page."" Follow Craig Morgan on Twitter",Raw Data

NHL, union agree on tentative deal NHL leaning toward 48-game season Horrow: What hurdles remain? Happy players react on Twitter Key details in deal | Lockout timeline You start with a problem created by long-running incompetence by those charged with solving the problem. You waste a lot of time doing absolutely nothing to solve the problem, instead spewing rhetoric and grandstanding for your own constituency. Then you set an arbitrary deadline to create a false sense of urgency. And finally you celebrate what amounts to a big bag of nothing. Sorry, hockey boys, you are on your own. While yall were away, I have been busy watching the Seahawks develop into the real deal. I have been watching this Dwight Howard-Lakers meltdown unfold. I have been busy watching incredibly too much playoff football, including the Washington Redskins selfishly allowing/encouraging injured quarterback Robert Griffin III to play on a medically compromised knee. I have ND-Bama plans, as well as a calendar packed with more NFL games. Most of America already felt this way, but you have evoked this malaise in your own core constituency. Losing half of this season so soon after skipping an entire season in useless labor negotiations has led to fan fatigue and rhetoric spewed by Gary John Boehner Bettman or Donald Nancy Pelosi Fehr. It has done absolutely zero to change most feelings. Bettman long has argued that the NHL has a spending problem. The league was paying too much for its players, was not getting a big enough cut of revenue and had to cut back or its franchises would be in peril of going under. Fehr talked of making the wealthy owners pay a bigger share, of taking care of the workers, of raising the NHLs debt ceiling. This went on and on for what seemed like forever. Both sides entrenched and were unwilling to tackle the real problem. In Washington, this is spending more than is brought in. The only solution is difficult fiscal decisions about spending and taxation to bring about a bottom line that is not only balanced but begins paying off our debt. In hockey, this is about recognizing that it is no longer part of The Big Four not in TV revenue, TV ratings, fan interest and the league no longer can operate as such. This is, of course, a result of the sides' own folly, a folly they compounded with this latest work stoppage. Hockey fans have what politicos like to call voter fatigue. There are only so many crises, so many cliffs, so many averted disasters we can hear about before we just stop caring. Want to know why only 50 percent of America votes? Because most people do not think their voice makes a difference. I have come to feel this way as an NHL fan. I am sick of their bickering, their inability to solve their real problems, their absolute lack of touch with anybody outside their bubble. This league has relied on the rabidity of its diehard fans for far too long, taking for granted that we will continue to pack buildings and watch the Stanley Cup after yet another work stoppage. They actually are trying to sell this idea that they saved the season, much like the pols are trying to sell that they saved us from the fiscal cliff. How dumb do they think we are? SEE YA! Some NHL stars went overseas during the lockout. Find out who went where. You cannot save yourself from yourself. There is no valor is fixing what you broke. This is what you are supposed to do, clean up your mess. There is also an understanding you will learn from your mistakes and stop making them. And there is nothing from the fiscal cliff fiasco or the NHL lockout mess to suggest this has happened. Gary Boehner Bettman and Donald Pelosi Fehr were busy afterward selling victory, or how they did the best they could, given the intractable jerkholes opposition. We have come to expect this kind of obstructionist approach to so many things in life that it no longer seems weird or sits wrong with us. It should. We no longer are willing to compromise to reach what is in the best interest of the whole, a sad truth belied by both this fiscal cliff and NHL lockout. There were winners and losers declared, and I will leave that for somebody else to determine. What I know for sure is the greater good of the country was not a winner in the fiscal cliff deal and the greater good of the game was not one in the lockout. Both were given lip service, if not just simply ignored altogether. As Thomas Jefferson, among others, once remarked: In a democracy, people get the government they deserve. And if the founding fathers could have envisioned guys on skates with sticks trying to score goals, Jefferson probably would have said hockey fans are getting exactly the sport we deserve as well.",Raw Data

By all accounts, Dallas Cowboys players Jerry Brown and Josh Brent were friends. And like friends do in all walks of life, not just pro athletics, they were celebrating Friday night with a drink. Then a drink allegedly became two and two may have become however many were required for Brent to be legally intoxicated, which police have now charged him with being when they say he sped down an Irving, Texas, highway at around 2:20 a.m., flipped his car and ultimately tried to pull his friend from the burning wreckage. According to the police report, this was the scene officers arrived to early Saturday morning — a desperate Brent trying to save his friend. It is the one that makes my heart hurt the most, mostly because he failed. Two friends: One is dead, the other in jail charged with being responsible for his death. There is so much tragedy in this one decision — to drive after drinking rather than call a cab, or a friend, or somebody associated with the team. Better to call and wake Cowboys owner Jerry Jones than risk driving while intoxicated. Yet so many Americans make the choice Brent allegedly did. The statistics should be sobering — Mothers Against Drunk Driving reporting 13,000 to 14,000 people killed by drunk drivers every single year, and such a disproportionate amount of NFL arrests dealing with vehicles and alcohol. But they are not. We keep drinking and driving even though we know it is stupid. It was not that long ago that another Dallas Cowboys player, Dwayne Goodrich, got behind the wheel of a car after a couple of drinks. It was Jan. 14, 2003, and he stuck three Good Samaritans trying to save a man in a burning car, then fled the scene. Two died. Goodrich ended up in prison until 2011. He returned to the Cowboys facility this year, telling rookies his story in hopes of being a warning. Brent had to have at least heard about him being around, yet none of it resonated. The question is: Why? A week ago, when news broke that Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher had shot and killed his girlfriend and mother of his child, then turned the gun on himself at the team facility, we were quick to condemn him and draw links to guns and use the term ""murderer."" There was talk the league should postpone the game. In contrast, when news broke that Brent had been charged in the death of a Cowboys practice player, there was not nearly the outrage, hand wringing or navel gazing. The prominent thought was that he made a horrible, tragic mistake. What he made was a decision, just as Belcher did. The results of both were tragic. Brown was going to be a dad. His child, like Belcher's, will grow up without a father. Yes, Brown chose to get into a car with a drunk driver, but his death is no less unnecessary than Kasandra Perkins’. What makes it almost harder to stomach is how preventable it was — just a call to a friend or a taxi. The danger is how we talk about them, Belcher being a bad guy who did an unfathomably awful thing (he did) while Brent is a good guy (and I have talked to him, he is) who made an awful mistake. And I am not sure this is useful. I am so sick of “I did not mean to hurt you” being an excuse for every kind of wretched behavior. What you meant matters not, compared to what you did. And I think we purposefully forget this because using a gun in an argument is incomprehensible to most of us, thus easy to demonize. Getting behind the wheel of a car after having one too many is entirely too comprehensible for many of us. We have a hard time getting all up in arms about Brent because we all know “there but for the grace of God go I.” So we call what Brent did a mistake. When in reality, what he did was kill — his choices led to the death of another and he knew better because he already had a DUI arrest. I say this not without sympathy for him. There is tragedy in the victim. There is also tragedy in Brent’s situation. This is a player who, by all accounts, worked hard and had a bright future. Now he is facing a significant amount of his life in prison, not to mention the pain and regret of knowing he played a role in his friend’s death. Whatever happens in the court or going forward, I cannot imagine there will ever be a day when Brent does not relive trying to pull Brown from that car or regret getting behind the wheel or wonder why he did not call a cab. This is the real tragedy of drunk driving, how easily preventable it is. And this is the real reason it keeps happening — we are scared to speak too loudly about it because we know, “There but for the Grace of God go I.”",Raw Data

Spencer has lent her expertise to both television and radio and is a regular contributor to SiriusXM Radio and the Performance Racing Network. Although Bowyer promised to bring his redneck ways for his debut at the Rolex 24 at Daytona, ultimately, the Emporia, Kan. native decided to leave his cowboy boots in the motorcoach during his first stint for AF Waltrip Racing. And it didn’t take the Rolex rookie long to learn a valuable lesson when he entered the pits in the No. 56-GT. “I guess I hit the kill button or something getting in and obviously couldn’t get going so we lost a lot of track position there,” said Bowyer, who dropped to 26th in the process. “I’m super bummed out about that. The biggest thing is just getting used to the car and getting to know the car. Man, it’s hard to be consistent out there. You can’t ever get a clean lap, and then about the time you do, you’ll go in the chicane, and there’ll be dirt everywhere — you kind of revisit your dirt-track experience — and then you’re back to dodging . . . there’s some debris out there. I think there’s trunk lids — nothing too big. There’s stuff everywhere, to be honest with you. “Thank God we have spotters out there. We were here to test and didn’t have any spotters. They’re lifesavers, with the DP cars coming on. That’s my biggest worry being here, just staying out of the way and not ruining one of those DP car’s day, especially costing them a good finish.” Bowyer took over for his teammate Rui Aguas two hours and 19 minutes into the race. He was impressed with the Portuguese driver, who competes for AF Waltrip in the FIA World Endurance Championship tour along with Michael Waltrip Racing co-owners Waltrip and Rob Kaufmann. “He did a great job early,” Bowyer said of Aguas after his 90-minute turn. “He was super fast in the car, drove up through the field. It was neat to watch that, and, unfortunately, I put us back to 12th or something and just kind of maintained there.",Raw Data
420,"INDEPENDENCE, Ohio -- Kyrie Irving could miss the rest of the season with a sprained shoulder, Cavaliers coach Byron Scott said Monday. The Cavs officially projected Irving to miss 3-4 weeks. Irving suffered the injury after running into Toronto center Jonas Valanciunas in the third quarter of Sundays loss. A variety of injuries have caused the reigning Rookie of the Year and All-Star point guard to miss a combined 29 of his first 129 games. Since summer, Irving has suffered a broken hand, broken finger and broken jaw. Scott also spoke last week of potentially shutting down Irving because of knee soreness (although Cavs officials denied that would be the case). Scott couldn't say for sure how the latest injury will impact Irving's chances of playing again this season. But the coach did admit it could be season-ending. ""We just have to wait and see what happens,"" Scott said. ""If it's two weeks, obviously, that's til the end of March. Then you've got to focus in on these guys here right now. But in those two weeks, we'll have to reevaluate and see what's going on. ""You only have two weeks left in the season. I don't want to speculate and say, 'Hey, if he can get back he'll get back. If he can't, he can't.' We're just going to have to wait until it's completely healed and go from there.'' Irving underwent X-rays on Sunday at the Air Canada Centre. An MRI at the Cleveland Clinic on Monday revealed a left AC sprain. The injury is similar to that experienced by NFL quarterbacks who are driven to the ground and land on their shoulder, according to a Cavs official. Irving missed all but 11 games in college at Duke with a toe injury. He leads the Cavs in scoring (23.0 pgg), assists (5.7 apg) and steals (1.6 spg). Scott said he's not concerned that Irving is prone to injuries. ""Like I said a week or two ago, he still is very young,"" Scott said. ""His body hasn't fully developed. I'm just not that concerned about it, to be honest with you. ""All the injuries that he has gotten have been legitimate injuries. It's not something that keeps recurring over and over again. From just what I saw (Sunday), with the little hip check, it was just an unfortunate foul that hit him right on the spot. So I'm not really concerned about it.""",Raw Data
421,"﻿I HAD a really upsetting phone call the other day. It was from some bloke called Bob, claiming to be from the Ford Motor Company, and it went something like this: “Hi George, it’s Bob here. We’d like our S-Max back.” Well that’s a bit outrageous, so I put on my best Pakistani accent, which always comes out as Welsh, and said: “George who? There’s no George lives here. No sir, I think you’ve got the wrong number.” “Come on George, stop mucking about.” “Sorry sir, this is the Star of Rajastan. Would you like to order a takeaway? Sorry but we do not deliver.” Well that was the end of that, or so I hoped, but next thing I got a letter. It was from Bob. He still wanted his S-Max back, and he’d signed it “Nag, nag, nag.” So I rang to tell him that the S-Max had been nicked by a gang of Brummies – with Aston Villa scarves, just to make it sound more convincing. It worked too, I thought, because he said: “That’s OK. I’ll tell the garage.” Brilliant, that way I’d get to keep the S-Max over Christmas, then I’d say it had mysteriously turned up and give it back. No chance, because he continued: “I’ll tell the garage ... to send someone round to collect it tomorrow.” And that was that. Next day Big Ron turned up and it was gone. I’d only had it for six months. Mind you, it was a great six months. At just two inches shorter than a Galaxy, and sitting on the same platform, you wonder what’s going through people’s heads when they choose the more expensive Galaxy. After all, both cars have got massive boots, seven-seat capacity and, with all three rows of seats folded flat, a huge load-lugging capacity. Personally, and because I’m only 5ft 7½in, I’d choose the S-Max because, height-wise, it’s six inches shorter and far easier to clean. Well, that and the fact that it makes it much more car-like to drive than Mum’s school bus. Mind you, most of my trips in the S-Max, just like schoolkids, were spent in the back while Mrs Motormouth drove me and my mate Dave up to the curry house. I’d always use the excuse that I needed to sit in the back to “assess its comfort and leg room”. In fact, sitting in the back of the S-Max, and I don’t mean in its third row of folding seats, is more like being chauffeured around in a stretched limo, there’s that much room. You slide into its black leather and Alcantara seats, with red stitching, stretch out your legs, notice that there’s a conservatorysized black-tinted glass roof and it’s just magic. The interior, in fact, is extremely posh all round, with soft-touch trim, silver-trimmed knobs and instruments and piano black inserts in the doors and dash. With both rows of rear seats folded flat there’s a colossal 7ftdeep loading space that’s nearly 4ft wide, which makes it great for shifting big stuff around and for trips to the tip. Fold down the rear two seats and its still 3ft deep while, with both rows of seats upright, rear space is down to just 16 inches. Even so, the whole thing is 3ft high so Mum should still be able to get most of her kids’ stuff in there by piling them on top of each other. That’s their toys, not the kids. Yep, the S-Max is one incredibly practical car, but that’s not at the expense of its drive, which, with a 2.2-litre diesel engine, is remarkably fast and smooth, thanks to a mighty 311lb of torque that provides instant power. Meanwhile the whole car has a really solid, well-built, feel that hits you as soon as you get in, when the doors shut with a big-car thunk. There’s really not a lot to dislike about the S-Max, it’s that good. You get that high-up drive that mums love, lots of storage spaces, including hidden ones in the rear footwell, genuine spaciousness and decent fuel economy, too. Ford claim an average 40mpg and, driven really, really gently it is possible to get near that. In the real world, though you can expect more like 34mpg, which is still not bad for a car of this size. Whatever Bob gives me next had better be good, because it will have a lot to live up to. I’ll let you know.",Raw Data
422,"Pastor Maldonado's Williams was fifth fastest on its first day of testing, but more than a second off the pace. ""I am very pleased with how the day went lap-time wise,"" said Rosberg. ""We are making progress and it is going in the right direction."" The top four all set their fastest times on the 'medium' tyre, whereas Maldonado was on the 'soft', which is theoretically faster over one lap. Lap times in testing are rarely accurate indications of form as teams do not reveal the specification in which they were running their cars. Even times set on the same type of tyre are not necessarily comparable as the fuel loads drivers were using were not made public and these can make a huge difference to lap times. Williams unveiled their new car on Tuesday morning, having decided to run a 2012 car at the first test two weeks ago, and were soon hit with some bad news. Governing body the FIA told them that a controversial exhaust design they had devised was illegal, which means they will have to change it before the first race or risk being disqualified. The Caterham team, who have a different but equally controversial exhaust, have been told the same thing. The test got off to a slow start, with McLaren's Sergio Perez, for example, completing only two laps in the first two hours. But as the temperatures warmed up, the drivers began to get down to work from about 1000 GMT. Perez, Lewis Hamilton's replacement at McLaren, was the first driver in a top team to set a fast time, but his lap was soon eclipsed first by Alonso and then by Di Resta. Vettel then set a benchmark of one minute 24.039 seconds on the 'medium' tyres before Raikkonen used the 'hards' to set his fastest lap. Alonso almost matched the Finn before Vettel set his second benchmark, and the morning's fastest lap, of 1:23.046. Vettel lowered his time again shortly after lunch and held sway at the top for most of the afternoon before a late flurry of times from Rosberg, Raikkonen and Alonso. Rosberg was fastest after the first two hours of the day but ended the morning eighth, 1.474secs off the pace. The German is sharing the car this week with new team-mate Hamilton, alternating from day to day throughout the four-day test. Rosberg lost at least two hours' running when the team had to fix a gearbox problem, but recovered to have a productive afternoon, culminating in the fastest time of 1:22.616. He added: ""I didn't get many laps in which is a bit of a pity, for sure. We have to work on that and get more laps in - there are a bit too many reliability issues at the moment. ""Other than that it is going in the right direction and the car feels decent. It feels better than the last time we were here."" Perez ended the day seventh fastest, behind the Toro Rosso of Daniel Ricciardo. Much of the attention this week will be on Alonso, who is driving the first three days of this test for his first experience of the new Ferrari. Last year's world championship runner-up decided to skip the first test two weeks ago to concentrate on his physical and mental preparation for the new season, which starts in Australia on 17 March. ""The feeling in the car was OK, more or less as expected,"" said Alonso. ""It's a continuation of the Brazil car [from the end of last season], let's say, more or less the same feeling. ""I have the same seat, the same pedals, the same everything so when you jump in the car it should be more or less the same as Brazil, so this is at least something good, not like last year when we drove for the first time we were a little bit surprised on the bad side. ""There is a lot of work to do in the next days for tyres, aerodynamics, experimental things that we need to do in the car. We need to do a lot of mileage to prove the cars are strong enough to race."" SECOND PRE-SEASON TEST, DAY ONE, CIRCUIT DE CATALUNYA, SPAIN, FASTEST TIMES 1. Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes 1:22.616 2.

His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. If Roger Goodell wanted to erase the stench of the replacement ref fiasco, create a distraction to overshadow his bungling of Bountygate and get back in the good graces of working journalists weary of faux Tebowmania, the commish would cite the 2004 “Playmakers” ruling and cancel the rest of the New York Jets' season. Seriously. Cancel the Jets. Cancel the Jets because they’re a disgrace, a blight on the good name of the NFL, the worst thing to happen to America’s pastime since the Worldwide Leader aired 11 dramatic episodes of “Playmakers.” Former commissioner Paul Tagliabue set the precedent. He pressured Disney into killing the Cougars, the fictional professional football squad portrayed in “Playmakers.” Tagliabue thought the Cougars were a “gross mischaracterization” of life in the NFL and negatively portrayed the league. Rex Ryan and the Jets are not gross? They’re not gross caricatures who negatively portray life on this planet? The Jets aren’t a real-life re-enactment of “Playmakers” worthy of cancellation? Goodell should've canceled Monday night’s episode of “Playmakers of New York” just to save Jon Gruden from the three hours of mental gymnastics trying to pretend Ryan and the Jets aren’t an X-rated circus act. I can’t be the only person to notice the Jets went from Super Bowl contenders to Super Bowl pretenders once their head coach transformed publicly from Rex Ryan, son of legendary defensive guru Buddy Ryan, to Sex Ryan, the bastard child of legendary smut kingpin Larry Flynt. Yep, after playing in back-to-back AFC Championships, the Jets have been an inconsistent .500 club since Deadspin.com unearthed alleged evidence that Rex and his wife spent their free time exploring their foot fetish on the Internet. In fact, since December of 2010, when the foot fetish controversy began, the Jets have played 28 NFL games, including the playoffs, that matter and they’ve lost half of them. The Jets have a clown for a coach. It’s no coincidence they play like clowns on the field and act like clowns off it. The starting quarterback, Mark Sanchez, completes a much higher percentage of passes off the field than on it. He’s gone from connecting with hot-to-trot teenagers to hooking up with a 37-year-old desperate housewife, Eva Longoria. Yep, off the field, Sanchez spreads the ball to a wide variety of receivers. He keeps his name relevant on Page 6 of the New York tabloids. Just in the past week Longoria publicly denied being pregnant by Sanchez even though no one asked. Is it worth mentioning that Longoria’s ex, Spurs point guard Tony Parker, quarterbacks a far more efficient offense and is less turnover prone than her latest public-relations ploy/boyfriend? The team’s other quarterback, Tim Tebow, remains a cult figure because of his alleged Just Say No bedroom campaign. Now, Tebow was brought to New York to run the wildcat, but the team’s new offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano, is utilizing a Just Say No wildcat campaign. The San Francisco 49ers mocked New York’s wildcat package by unveiling a superior one in a 34-point mauling. Goodell should Just Say No to the Jets. Put them out of their misery. Spare the league the embarrassment of such a high-profile dysfunctional team. The Jets are doing far more damage to the NFL’s rep than “Playmakers” ever did.

425,"Fans, fellow riders, flower girls and foreign coaches: they all wanted their photo taken with Martyn Irvine on Thursday night. Despite being out on his feet, track cycling's newest hero had to fight to leave the velodrome at Minsk Arena. Hardly any of them would have known who he was only a few hours earlier but, by the end of a remarkable day in the Belarus capital, the affable Irvine had become the story of these 2013 World Championships. He also had two medals, a rainbow jersey and a beaming smile to show for his carefully budgeted trip to Eastern Europe. Who was Harry Reynolds? Born on 14 December 1874, he started cycling aged 18. Reynolds won the 1896 World Mile Championships in Copenhagen and took bronze a year later in Glasgow. He died aged 65 on 16 July 1940. Legend has it that Reynolds raced the steam train from Balbriggan to Skerries for training. He also apparently rode up Barnageera Hill on a fixed wheel, backwards for a bet - which he won. The Balbriggan Cycling Club hold a race in his name 'the Harry Reynolds Memorial' every year. Irvine has had to wait a while for global fame but in the end it arrived quickly. At just past 8pm local time, the 27-year-old from Newtownards in Northern Ireland became the first Irishman since Harry Reynolds in 1897 to win a world track championships medal when he took silver in the individual pursuit. Just 54 minutes later, and after collecting his medal, he got back on his bike to take a thrilling gold in the 15km scratch race. His famous victory came via a nail-biting finish that had the crowd on their feet at the very end of a 60-lap race, but it almost did not happen at all. Irvine had returned to his hotel after setting a new Irish record in qualifying for the gold medal final of the 4km individual pursuit earlier in the day and, on his way back to the velodrome, was contemplating pulling out of his second event of the day. ""I came back to the track on the same bus as him and he was umming and arring whether he was actually going to ride the scratch race,"" said former Olympic gold medallist and BBC Sport analyst Chris Boardman, who is staying in the same hotel as the Irish team. ""He knew it was straight after the award ceremony for the individual pursuit, but I bet he is glad he gave it a go now. He's a gutsy rider and he just went out there and made it happen. ""I don't think anyone in the arena saw that Australia's Luke Davison took bronze in the scratch race because everyone was focused on Martyn after he crossed the line. Everyone likes to see the underdog win and he did it in style today - everyone is really pleased for him."" Who is Martyn Irvine? Born on 6 June 1985, he started competitive cycling aged 18. His first significant result was finishing runner-up in the 2007 Irish U23 road race and his best results before arriving in Minsk saw him win silver medals in the scratch race and individual pursuit at the UCI Track World Cup in Glasgow in November. Irvine has signed for US road team UnitedHealthcare, who compete at continental level, for the 2013 season. He had the option to represent Great Britain but chose to ride for Ireland. There is one small part of the Minsk Arena that was particularly happy. Each team here has its own pen in the centre of the track where their mechanics work on bikes, coaches plan tactics and their riders warm up for their races. The Irish team is a small one, so their space is in tiny in proportion to others - for example the 31-strong Russian contingent - but this year they are sharing with the United States, whose flag is draped alongside an Irish one on a dividing partition to mark their territory. The reason for this arrangement is Andy Sparks, who has a role as Ireland's track coach as part of his work with several smaller cycling nations. He is also husband and coach to US rider Sarah Hammer. The only American rider here, Hammer has been training with Sparks and the Irish team and the arrangement seems mutually beneficial - she won her fifth world individual pursuit title on Wednesday. Hammer's success was much less of a shock than Irvine's of course. Although Sparks predicted a scratch race medal before these World Championships for a man who has won seven national titles on the road and track, seeing him win a world gold and silver medal - especially in the space of an hour - stands out as an incredible achievement on Ireland's meagre resources. Cycling Ireland's head coach Brian Nugent told BBC Sport ""We have no track training facility in Ireland and our budget is extremely small. Irvine after his scratch race win ""I'm exhausted. It's awesome. I don't know what to say. There hasn't been a race I haven't committed to but I've been chipping away on a shoestring budget over the last couple of years. Once I went I didn't look back. Just full gas. I saw a shadow on my hip with two laps to go and I was expecting lots of riders to go past me. I can't wait to see the video of the race."" ""But he is a committed guy with a committed team and we have got a good coach in Andy who works with us in Majorca. ""What we do is base our best riders over there during the track season. Then they can do their work on the road and use the world championship track in Palma. Martyn is a road professional in the summer so he does all his track work in Palma. That is his level of commitment."" The hard work has paid off. Irvine was deflated after only managing 13th place in the omnium at the London Olympics after finishing seventh in the multi-discipline event at the 2012 World Championships. But continuing to plug away has brought its rewards, not least his own piece of history. Those 54 minutes in Minsk will live long in the memory of anyone who witnessed them, and there are plenty of people with photos to prove they were there.",Raw Data
426,"Rooney Moan ITV summed up last night just why I feel so compelled to point out how average Rooney is. Incase you didn't see it, the adverts before the United game were ""Fulham travel to Old Trafford....and Wayne awaited them"". They showed some clips of the game and then after said something like ""And Rooney was back on form"" then proceeded to show his goal and nothing else. Strachan spouted a load of tosh like him being a top top player who makes others play blah blah. No mention of Giggs. No mention of how actually dire Rooney was. He played terrible overall but had one good moment and then gets all the praise. Unbelievable! Silvio Dante (again) Explaining Sagna's Poor Form Regarding Kiraldo's email about Sagna, i think a lot can be put down to the leg break. Sometimes players come back well from injuries, i.e. Wilshere, but a lot don't like Djibril Cisse, Ramsey and Cech, who has never been that good again. Maybe you can put it down to seeing your leg at an angle or something. It can effect a player in a lot of ways; you miss a year or more of playing and fall behind in skill and pace etc, and also maybe fear of something horrendous happening again it detracts from their effort either consciously or sub consciously. In years gone by I would have baulked at seeing him go, but after warming to Jenkinson maybe it's time Sagna went back home to the easier French league or something. Steve (in Arsene we trust!) Australia Don't Judge Wilf By His Stats One thing that really annoys me, and has steadily increased over the last few years, is the judging of a player based on his stats. The all mighty statistic has over taken actually watching a player and forming an opinion based on what you see. I will admit I like to annoy Liverpool fans with the fact Stewart Downing went so long without an assist but it was actually watching him be atrocious in games that made me feel comfortable slating him. The thing which has me writing in now is obviously Zaha's transfer to United and the inevitable stat check by everyone and their dog, 5 goals and 5 assists for a winger in 32 games is proof 15 million is way over priced apparently. This ignores the fact he has played over a hundred games at a championship club and he's only 20. It's accepted that if you buy a young English player you pay an inflated price without bringing up obvious examples.The thing that really annoys me is where's the stats for wingers who beat a player or two and lay the ball off to a player who then passes the ball to the forward who scores? Where's the stats for corners, free kicks or throw ins won which led to goals? The stats for intelligent movement to pull defenders out of position? Players who win penalties are awarded assists but someone who beats 9 men and squares the ball to a forward who misses an open goal doesn't get anything.Would anyone say Raheem Sterling (2 goals 2 assists) hasn't been good enough this season? What I'm not trying to say is Zaha will definitely be a success, I haven't seen nearly enough of him to judge, but what I have seen is undoubted potential and will reserve judgement until i see more of him myself .There is a reason clubs have people watched in person before signing them. I know it might seem odd to people who spend their Friday setting up their fantasy team, but there's more aspects to winning games than goals and assists that are just as important. Sorry for the rant but what I really wanted to say was put some trousers on, put down the laptop and actually watch some football and judge players properly. GD, Dublin On Schmeichel, Keller And De Gea In response to Ben Baggie, Schmeichel wasn't a world class goalkeeper? I really shouldn't bite at such drivel, but alas I am. You have your opinion about what makes a good goalkeeper, an opinion you seem to think is the only one that matters. My opinion, and I think it's a view shared by many, is that a good goalkeeper is one who keeps the ball out of the goal, hence the name 'goalkeeper'. Schmeichel has the highest ratio of clean sheets:games ratio of any goalkeeper in the premier league era (except John O'Shea of course) playing behind a defence that was generally not as good as the one Seaman played behind. So what if he was unorthodox? Michael Johnson's running technique was constantly criticised throughout his career, yet he set world record after world record. I would argue that it takes a lot more than good technique to make a goalkeeper, Schmeichel's ability to organise his defence was second to none, his presence was second to none, his reflexes were second to none, I could go on but I won't because it's absurd to suggest that Schmeichel wasn't a world class goalkeeper, are you saying he wouldn't have made the West Brom team? Fred, Belfast ...Ben (I could have included Alan Miller and Stuart Naylor in my good keeper list) Baggie. Still laughing at the Villa. You had me. You really did. I read your whole piece with an open mind thinking ""MY GOD MAYBE THE KID HAS SOMETHING!"" in a 20's Chicago style voice. And maybe what you said was bait. SCHMEICHEL!!!!! SCHMEICHEL!!!! The behemoth of goalkeeping. The god of thunder. I used to be a staunch ABU but even as a kid I had to admit that Utd fans had every right to be arrogant over their keeper. Overrated? Maybe, I don't really care about that never ending argument, we can't ever prove an answer. I remember Schmeichel pulling unreal saves, making himself REALLY BIG and in my opinion him being a total dick to Gary Neville made him a better defender than he ever had to be. It wasn't cause Neville was saving his bacon, Schmeichel demanded big d*ckish standards but hes got the medels to show for it. The epitome of a goalkeeper that defenders feel confident in front of. Goalkeeping is much more than technique pal, its about leadership too. And leadership by technique. The worst thing I can remember about Peter was that he had a tendancy to be lobbed a few times. Aside from that I can't think of a fault. Kasey Keller may have probably been better for United but Peter also did pretty well in 92 for Denmark, a team that were definitely not considered among the greats (you might want to look that one up). I thought your argument was really thinking outside the box and something to rejoice, but I just couldn't get past this obvious ""controversial"" pick. Past his peak Schmeichel also played for struggling Aston Villa and Man City teams that were flirting in the relegation game. And they stayed up, in an era were Leicester and Southampton were about the same standard, or a little worse or a little better. You are a brilliant troll. I am still writing trying to remember the awesomeness of Russell Hoult. He was never top calibre. Good obviously, but never overly wanted. I imagine there'll be a few of these. Dave (I can't believe you forgot about Bobby Mimms), Ireland ...Sorry, sorry... Hold on.. Ben, Baggie, did you just say that Kasey Keller was a better keeper than Peter Schmeichal? You may very well be still laughing a Villa my friend but I for one am still laughing at you! Leon, Basel. ...Your argument is so played out it all it highlights is your over-riding desire to be a contrarian and your general lack of respect for the readership of this website. David de Gea is 22 years old. Not only is he 22 years old and playing in the Premier League but he's 22 years old and first choice keeper at Manchester United. Who are top of the league. And before you say it; they have a back four comprised of perma-crocked young pretenders; a central partnership whose salad days are far behind them; and no one in midfield tasked with the specific job of screening said back for. Add to that a new country, new team mates, a new language, new league and the tiny matter of the pressure cooker that is Old Trafford and what do you get? A shaky handed, bumbling, clanger-prone experiment bleeding goals on the reg? No you don't. What you actually get is a surprisingly calm and focused young player who on his is capable of keeping out match-winners on his own. And he's only 22. I mean come on man - no technique? You think that's all reflexes do you? No hand-to-eye involved, no positional awareness to those 'tremendous saves'? Mate have you seen his footwork? Don't use a term like 'technique' when you clearly think all that means is 'one's ability to catch' (ps ,Nigel Martyn was not afraid a parry for the cameras). It's true he's not great at crosses or necessarily communicating with his defenders but - and I know I'm going on here - he's twenty sodding two. He's better than last year, he'll be better next year. Right now, as David James did most of his career, he's winning Utd far more games than he's costing them so let's not write of a 22yr old for not being Buffon quite yet eh mate? To be honest I could go on but my girlfriend's taking me out for a Thai (swag) and I think I've made my point. Someone else can address can address the 'Schmeichel was over-rated' angle for me. Simon (hang on, do you even print mails on the weekend?) CFC ...Kasey Keller was a far better keeper than Peter Schmeichel? Not even just better, but far better? Ben, that is hilarious. I know that one youtube clip isn't a fair representation of an entire career, but about 1.50 into this Keller does something Schmeichel would never have done (and if he did, it definitly wouldn't have been his fault) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V4SwZkq1O8 Begbie ...Ben Baggie; the ideal goalkeeper which you seem to be describing is one who is consistent, reliable and composed. Given this, I cannot believe that you are trying to put Ben Foster into this category; a goalkeeper who frequently makes a hash of 'routine' goalkeeping and who is constantly tense. He was allowed to leave Old Trafford because when he was given a chance in the first team he made a series of nervous errors; he was all over the place, and with all respect he couldn't handle the pressure. I simply could not put the words 'composed' and 'reliable' alongside 'Ben Foster'. However, he is a fine shot-stopper. In fact, Foster is a perfect example of the 'hero' goalkeeper whose reputation has been founded on great shot-stopping performances, rather than solidity. 'Fools', as you call them. Whilst I don't disagree with every point you make, your central argument is, I think, wrong. Having been a goalkeeper for many years, I think I can say with confidence that goalkeeping is actually mainly about presence. This is both the mental fortitude which you alluded to with Joe Hart's arrogance and the physical size to intimidate strikers and cover the goal more easily. I agree that the right technique does make things easier, and being composed helps with decision making. But you simply cannot disregard the physical aspect of goalkeeping. Seaman was a great keeper but in the last five or six years of his career he turned into something of an embarrassment, because whilst his technique, reliability and composure were still there, he became cumbersome and immobile. For my money, Van der Sar and Cech are both easily the best Premier League goalkeepers of the last ten years, for whilst they possessed all of the technique and composure which you hold in such regard, they were also big, physical keepers who possessed the raw goalkeeping attributes, such as agility and quick reflexes. In the final analysis, saving shots is what goalkeeping is about. I can only hope that your tongue has spent much of its time in your cheek.

First up on the list is Vinnie Pestano who racked up 59 holds in the setup role over the last two seasons. However, John Halpin was quick to point out that Pestano struggles against lefties (Stats: Pestano .780 career OPS v. LH, .446 v. RH.

428,"Jones joined United from Blackburn Rovers in 2011 and has shown his versatility by playing at centre-half, right-back and in a central midfield role for the Premier League leaders. The 20-year-old impressed in midfield against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend and Ferguson is delighted with the England international's progress at Old Trafford. ""Jones was absolutely brilliant at Tottenham in the role we asked him to play,"" said Ferguson. ""He did it really well. He can play anywhere. He is quick, two-sided and reads the game well. He's competitive and has got a great change of pace going forward so the boy has done very well."" Comparisons were drawn with Terry earlier in Jones' career, but Ferguson feels the youngster has more to his game than the Chelsea defender. The United boss added: ""Well, I think he's got more in his locker than Terry had to be honest with you but Terry gathered experience and became a fantastic central figure for Chelsea. ""Obviously, he was the main man at Chelsea but, as a young player, I think John would be the first to admit he didn't have the pace of Jones. ""He's a very versatile boy while John is a centre-back. Jones is proving himself everywhere.""",Raw Data
429,"MILWAUKEE -- As Andrew Bogut sat on the bus Friday night while his Golden State Warriors made their way from Chicago to Milwaukee, seven years of his life ran through his head.? The bus ride suddenly became nostalgic when Bogut peered out the window and saw a sign that read, ""Welcome to Wisconsin."" ""Ups and downs, good and bad,"" Bogut said of his time in Milwaukee. ""Rookie year was awesome. Being one of three to make the playoffs was great. The Fear the Deer' year was great. Everything in between wasn't so good. ""I kind of grew from a boy to a man while I was in Milwaukee. It will always be a special place in my heart. It was somewhat sad moment when I was sitting on the bus thinking about it."" Bogut was back in the BMO Harris Bradley Center on Saturday for the first time since the blockbuster trade that sent the 2005 No. 1 overall draft pick and Stephen Jackson to Golden State for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh and Kwame Brown on March 13. However, this wasn't how his return was supposed to go. Instead of assuming his place in Golden State's starting lineup and hearing an ovation as his name is called, Bogut was left with a gathering of Bucks fans watching him go through a pregame workout as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury that was the beginning of the end of his career in Milwaukee. Bogut fractured his ankle one year and one day ago in Houston, and that turned out to be his final game in a Bucks uniform. The 7-foot center has played in just four games for the Warriors since the trade, all at the start of this season. Bogut had one surgery in January, then endured microfracture surgery in April. After struggling early this season, Bogut and the Warriors decided taking a break was the best path to future success. He hasn't spoken with Bay Area reporters since Nov. 28 as he tries to work his way back to the court. ""It's definitely taken longer than we expected,"" Bogut said. ""I tried to give it a go at the start of the season, and it blew up. I lost my mobility and flexibility in November and decided it's smarter to try to be back for the long haul rather than try to play in five-game increments and have to take time off. ""It's frustrating. Nobody wants to be hurt. I don't want to be hurt. At the same time, I have no choice but to go through this process diligently, do the right things and come back strong."" The ankle was just one of two major injuries Bogut suffered with the Bucks. On April 3, 2010, Bogut threw down a fast-break dunk off a long outlet pass. As he hung on the rim, former Suns forward Amar'e Stoudemire hit him in the back and Bogut fell hard to the floor. The result was a dislocated elbow, broken wrist and sprained wrist. Playing his best basketball of his career at the time averaging 15.9 points and 10.2 rebounds Bogut didn't get to play in the 2010 playoffs with his team and was never the same player again. He acknowledged Saturday doctors told him after the injury that it would take him almost two years before he didn't feel pain in his elbow. Bogut has had two surgeries on the elbow, and he said it's finally starting to feel healthy almost three years after the injury. ""Am I injury-prone? Yes,"" said Bogut, 28. ""I'm injury-prone that I've had some gruesome injuries that I cannot control. I've never had a soft tissue injury due to the lack of conditioning or lack of fitness. ""It's just two unfortunate events that have taken years off my career, as far as playing."" With the Bucks taking Atlanta to Game 7 in the first round of the 2010 playoffs without Bogut, he said he often thinks he could have helped the team get over the hump. In fact, Bogut wonders at times what could have been in Milwaukee if the elbow injury didn't derail him at the peak of his career. ""But at the same time, I can't sit and mope about it and sit at home saying, What if? What if? What if?' "" Bogut said. ""I've tried to rehab that to the best of my ability, and I'm doing the same with my ankle."" Without Bogut, Golden State has been one of the league's surprises. The Warriors have started 26-16 behind All-Star forward David Lee and the young guard duo of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Because the Warriors have been winning, Bogut has had an easier time not feeling the need to rush back. ""If we were losing right now, it'd be different,"" he said. ""... When we start to win games, it definitely helps my sanity, but at the same time it's frustrating. The questions are always asked every day. It's just something I have to deal with."" Though his mind is focused on other things, Bogut still keeps tabs on his former team mainly because of friendships with players still on the roster. When asked about his reaction to the Bucks parting ways with coach Scott Skiles, Bogut responded, ""They did? When did that happen?"" Joking aside, Bogut had plenty of praise for Skiles. ""A lot of people think that we really didn't have a great relationship, but we did,"" Bogut said. ""We had run-ins like any player and coach. I think you have to have those to demand the best out of each other. Defensively, he really taught me how to be a good defender as a big man. ""What I learned with Coach Skiles is how to affect the basketball game without the ball, which is something I couldn't do my first two to three years in the league. I would have moped and been angry if I wasn't getting touches. With Coach, I might have got one touch a quarter, but I would still affect the game."" After the ankle injury last January, Bogut knew there was a good chance his time in Milwaukee was running short. He was told by Bucks management and his agent that a deal was on the table. He understood Milwaukee was trying to make a playoff push and said if he were GM John Hammond, he would have done the same thing. ""I was ready to go, but I wasn't,"" Bogut said. ""I wasn't stomping my feet to get traded from this city. It wasn't a situation where I was saying get me the (heck) out of here. ""Off the court, I didn't have a problem with anybody. I love this city, the people. There were some tough times on the court, but other than that, it was what it was. If I stayed, I wouldn't have had a problem; if I left, I wouldn't have had a problem."" Though he's been out, Bogut sees a future with the Warriors. At $13.2 million per year, he is Golden State's highest-paid player and will be again next season in the final year of a five-year contract he signed with the Bucks in 2008. ""We know when he's healthy and on the floor, there is no question he is going to help us and make us a better basketball team,"" Warriors coach Mark Jackson said. ""We know exactly who he is and what he brings to the table, and it's going to be a tremendous upgrade at that position.""",Raw Data

432,"WNBA players are scattered around the world during the offseason. Between Asia, Australia, and the EuroLeague, players from all 12 teams are competing in over a dozen countries around the world. Click here for an interactive map of the location of WNBA players abroad and see the most recent list below (subject to change, as not all players will be spending the entire winter abroad). Some will come back as others are just leaving, so stay tuned. [Player listing as of November 15, 2012]. Below we have compiled Five Things to Know for WNBA fans who would like to keep up with their favorite players competing abroad while the WNBA is in offseason mode. WNBA players love playing in Russia, as 18 current WNBAers are rostered on six different Russian teams (UMMC, Dynamo Moscow, Spartak, Nadezhda, Dynamo Kursk and Chekavata). UMMC in Yekaterinburg is the class of the Russian League thus far this season, sporting a 6-0 domestic league record [as of Dec, 5, 2012], thanks in large part to a star-studded roster including WNBA MVP's Diana Taurasi (Phoenix Mercury) and Candace Parker (Los Angeles Sparks). Three-time WNBA Champion with the Detroit Shock Deanna Nolan and current Seattle Storm player Ewelina Kobryn are also key contributors for UMMC, while Sue Bird is on the squad's roster but has yet to get any game action as she's recuperating from post-WNBA season surgery. Crystal Langhorne and Kristi Toliver (Dynamo Moscow), Seimone Augustus, Becky Hammon and Candice Dupree (Spartak), Renee Montgomery and DeWanna Bonner (Nadezhda) and Epiphanny Prince and Temeka Johnson (Dynamo Kursk) are some of the other top WNBA players to be plying their trade in the former Soviet Union during the offseason. Turkey is currently the second most popular destination for WNBA players competing abroad, with 15 WNBAers rostered on nine different Turkish clubs. Two legendary Istanbul-based sporting rivals -- Fenerbahce and Galatasary -- are also battling it out in the pursuit of top WNBA talent, with two of the WNBA's most dynamic talents -- Angel McCoughtry (Atlanta Dream) and Cappie Pondexter (NY Liberty) -- playing for Fenerbahce, while two 2012 Olympic gold medalists -- Sylvia Fowles (Chicago Sky) and Lindsay Whalen (Minnesota Lynx) -- rostered with Galatasary. Another Turkish club, Mersin, apparently targeted championship pedigree in their WNBA recruitment, signing current WNBA Champion Indiana Fever teammates Shavonte Zellous and Erlana Larkins. Four WNBA players competed on four different Chinese teams last year, but their has been significant growth of WNBA player exports in the Far East this year, with more than double the WNBA players (9) playing for double the amount of teams (9) in China for 2012-13. Additionally, four South Korean clubs have signed WNBA players: Woori Bank Hansea (Nakia Sanford), Shinhan Bank (Cathrine Kraayeveld), Samsung Life Bichumi (Amber Harris) and KB Stars (Lynetta Kizer). WNBA representation in China has not only doubled in number, but there has been a signficant upgrade in star power. 2012 WNBA Finals Most Valuable Player and U.S. Olympic Team Co-Captain Tamika Catchings, fresh off her first WNBA championship with the Indiana Fever, is playing for Guangdong, while 2011 Rookie of the Year and fellow U.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Maya Moore of the Minnesota Lynx is leading the way for the Shanxi Xing Rui Flames squad. Fans of WNBA players competing abroad during the WNBA offseason may find themselves with a case of ""league fatigue"" when faced with all the different leagues featuring their favorite WNBA stars. Here's a quick explanation. Most WNBAers are playing for teams that compete in the domestic league of the country they are playing in. So, Parker and Taurasi are playing in the Russian League and McCoughtry and Pondexter are in the Turkish League. The European teams, however, are ALSO competing in a larger, and in many respects more competitive and more prestigious league called the EuroLeague, which pits the top domestic teams from individual countries (ie. UMMC in Russia and Fenerbahce in Turkey) in a European wide tournament. Fans of college basketball can think of it like Brittney Griner and Baylor University compete in the Big 12 where they face conference foes in pursuit of a conference championship. Additionally, Griner and Baylor will appear in the NCAA tournament, where the top teams in each conference are matched up in tournament crowning the best of the best as the National Champion. The domestic European leagues are akin to the conferences, while the EuroLeague is similar to the NCAA Tournament, including a Final Four. While the vast majority of WNBA players competing abroad are doing so in a foreign land, there are a few players who are actually going home to play during the WNBA offseason. Three-time WNBA MVP Lauren Jackson has signed with the Canberra Capitols in her native Australia and while Jackson has not yet played for Canberra due to injury, they are happy to have her Down Under. Fellow Aussie Jenna O'Hea of the Los Angeles Sparks also headed home, where she is playing for Dandenong Rangers. The Atlanta Dream's Erika de Souza and Washington Mystic Izzy Castro-Marques are also in familiar surroundings during the WNBA offseason, as de Souza is playing at Recife and Castro-Marques at Maranhao, both in their native Brazil.",Raw Data

Ravens coach John Harbaugh, in fact, said the decision to fire Cameron was ""the hardest thing I've ever had to do as a coach."" Cameron, though, said the move to let him go was the right one because it put the entire team on alert. ""We were inconsistent, and if I'm in charge, I'm saying, 'Why are we inconsistent?' We need to get the team's attention,"" Cameron told the Times. Cameron reportedly has no ill will toward the Ravens and says he's been rooting for them in the playoffs.

434,"Both men found improvements after bolting on Pirelli's medium-compound rubber in the final 20 minutes of the day. Rosberg, whose morning had been disrupted by lengthy gearbox checks, was the first to make his move. New overall bests in the final two sectors produced a lap of 1m22.616s and vaulted him to the top of the timesheets. Minutes later Raikkonen staged his own late rally, but despite bettering Rosberg's sector two time he fell seven thousandths of a second short of putting Lotus on top. Fernando Alonso, again on mediums, was another late improver. On his first day in the Ferrari F138 last year's championship runner-up worked his way down to a 1m22.952s to end the day in third. The flurry of late improvements knocked morning pacesetter and reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel down to fourth. The German had gradually improved his lunchtime best and was the first man to dip into the 1m22s bracket, only to be bumped down the order in theclosing stages. Having launched its FW35 in the morning, Williams ended the day in fifth position courtesy of Pastor Maldonado, a racewinner at Barcelona last year. The Venezuelan spent time at the top of the timesheets in the morning and racked up 85 laps in total, behind only Alonso in 110. Daniel Ricciardo in the Toro Rosso STR8 shaded McLaren's Sergio Perez in the fight for sixth, while Paul di Resta - the day's third busiest man - was just two hundredths of a second down the road for Force India.

435,"After operating on Casillas on Friday, Dr. Miguel del Cerro said Casillas will be out ''for eight to 12 weeks, with anything less than 12 being a success.'' That means Casillas will miss Madrid's Copa del Rey semifinal against Barcelona and its Champions League clash with Manchester United on Feb. 13 and March 5. He will also likely miss two World Cup qualifiers for Spain against Finland on March 22 and France three days later. Del Cerro said two screws were inserted into Casillas' hand and that the operation ''went better than expected.''

436,"Before the All-Star break, Memphis Grizzlies owner Robert Pera expressed confidence that a pair of trades have put his team in a good position. The Grizzlies have found their stride lately with three straight wins, and two recently acquired players will try to help add to that run when they face their former Detroit Pistons teammates for the first time Tuesday night. In his first press conference in Memphis since being introduced in November, Pera said last week that the deals that sent leading scorer Rudy Gay to Toronto on Jan. 30 and three reserves to Cleveland on Jan. 22 were more than just getting the team under the luxury tax threshold. ""With the latest trades, the personnel moves, how the team is constructed, I think it has the potential to be the best Grizzlies team yet,"" Pera said. ""I really like how the pieces now fit kind of the traditional inside-out game. I think if they jell, then hopefully this could be the best playoff run yet."" Former Pistons Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye were two players the Grizzlies (33-18) acquired in the three-team trade that featured Gay. Toronto sent point guard Jose Calderon to Detroit and forward Ed Davis to Memphis. Prince, who was part of the Pistons' championship team in 2003-04 and played 10-plus seasons there, had 18 points and tied a franchise record by making all eight of his shots in Memphis' 105-88 win over Minnesota on Feb. 10. The forward, though, scored just seven points in a 108-101 victory against Sacramento last Tuesday. Daye, selected No. 15 overall by Detroit in the 2009 draft, scored 16 points versus Minnesota and seven against the Kings. Those games kicked off the Grizzlies' set of five straight matchups against sub-.500 teams, but the Pistons (21-33) have won three of four. Calderon scored a season-high 24 points and Will Bynum had 20 in a 96-85 home victory over Washington on Wednesday. ""I think there's chemistry now that we've played a couple games together,"" Bynum said. ""We cause matchup problems for just about whatever team we are going to play, and it is going to continue to get better the more we play together. I'm loving this."" Greg Monroe matched a season high with 18 rebounds while recording his eighth consecutive double-double, the longest streak by a Pistons player since Grant Hill had 10 in a row March 1-17, 1996. Monroe just missed his fourth straight double-double against the Grizzlies on Nov. 30, finishing with a team-best 17 points and nine rebounds in a 90-78 road loss. Marc Gasol had 17 points and 11 boards, and Mike Conley also scored 17 points in the Grizzlies' sixth consecutive win in the series. Memphis has won in each of its last four visits to Detroit.

438,"The NFL “reaffirmed” discipline on the alleged bounty players on Tuesday, but adjusted certain aspects of the penalties. Browns linebacker Scott Fujita had his suspension significantly reduced from three games to one. Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma’s suspension remains the same — he is suspended for the season — but he will retain his salary for the five weeks he spent on the PUP list and will receive another game check in Week 6. The NFL Players Association reacted swifly. “For more than six months, the NFL has ignored the facts, abused the process outlined in our collective bargaining agreement and failed to produce evidence that the players intended to injure anyone, ever. The only evidence that exists is the League’s gross violation of fair due process, transparency and impartiality during this process. Truth and fairness have been the casualties of the league’s refusal to admit that it might have made a mistake,” the NFLPA said in a statement following the commissioner’s discipline. “We will review this decision thoroughly and review all options to protect our players’ rights with vigilance.” After an internal appeals panel vacated the suspensions of Vilma, Fujita, Saints defensive end Will Smith and free-agent defensive end Anthony Hargrove in early September, the league made it clear that the decision was based on conduct detrimental to football. Each of the players has the right to appeal the ruling to league commissioner Roger Goodell. Since the players were willing to meet with Goodell during the period the suspensions were lifted, they may be more willing to participate in the appeals process this time around. Smith will be suspended four games and Hargrove will be suspended seven games, reduced from eight games, but is credited with missing the first five because he is a free agent. Vilma offered a response on Twitter, that read, in part, ''this is not news to me pride won't let him admit he's wrong.'' Smith issued a statement saying he will continue to explore his appeal options. The players were implicated in what the NFL said was a bounty pool run by former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams and paid improper cash bonuses for hits that injured opponents. The players have acknowledged a pool but denied they intended to injure anyone. The players can delay their suspensions by appealing again through their labor contract, which they have three days to do. They could also ask a federal judge in New Orleans to revisit their earlier request for an injunction blocking the suspensions. Still, Goodell upheld parts, or all of the players' suspensions. ''The quality, specificity and scope of the evidence supporting the findings of conduct detrimental (to the game) are far greater and more extensive than ordinarily available in such cases,'' Goodell said in a memorandum to the 32 clubs. Goodell's new ruling comes about a month after an appeal panel vacated the original suspensions on technical grounds during Week 1 of the regular season. The panel did not address the merits of the league's investigation. It merely asked Goodell to clarify to extent to which his ruling involved conduct detrimental to the league, which he has the sole authority to handle, and salary cap violations resulting from bonus payments, which would have to be ruled upon by an arbitrator other than the commissioner. ''In my recent meetings with the players and their counsel, the players addressed the allegations and had an opportunity to tell their side of the story,'' Goodell wrote. ''In those meetings, the players confirmed many of the key facts disclosed in our investigation, most particularly that the program offered cash rewards for `cart-offs,' that players were encouraged to `crank up the John Deere tractor' and have their opponents carted off the field, and that rewards were offered and paid for plays that resulted in opposing players having to leave the field of play.'' Only Smith and Fujita have played this season. Vilma has been recovering from offseason knee surgery and hopes to return in two weeks when the Saints play at Tampa Bay. Smith issued a statement after the new rulings were announced. ''I remain frustrated with the continued unilateral rulings by this commissioner as he continues to disregard the facts and assault my character,'' Smith said in the statement. ''Let me be clear- I never participated in a `pay-to-injure program,' never took the field with intent to injure another player, and never contributed any money to hurt other players. It was my hope that those investigating would put their arrogance and agenda aside in order to comprehend the difference between a `pay-for-performance program' and a `pay-to-injure program,' but until that day, I will continue to pursue my appeal options through the NFLPA, and attempt to return to work for my family, teammates, fans and the city of New Orleans.'' Goodell began to reconsider his disciplinary actions after the Sept. 7 appeal panel ruling and this time all four players agreed to meet with him. During those meetings the NFL produced sworn declarations by Williams and another former defensive assistant, Mike Cerullo, in which they stated that they observed Vilma offering what they believed were $10,000 rewards for knocking then-Arizona quarterback Kurt Warner and then-Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre out of 2009-10 playoff games. Vilma's attorney, Peter Ginsberg, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling, though Vilma has indicated he would be inclined to continue to fight his punishment in federal court. U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan has stated that she found the NFL's disciplinary process unfair and that she would be inclined to rule grant Vilma at least a temporary restraining order if she believed she had jurisdiction on the matter. However, Berrigan also has stated that she is hesitant to rule until she is certain the players have exhausted all possibile remedies available to them through the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. The other three players have been represented by the NFLPA, which stated it will carefully review Goodell's latest decision and ''protect our players' rights with vigilance,'' but did not disclose any immediate plans to take the matter back to court.

439,"ARSENE WENGER last night insisted: ""You will miss me when Im gone."" But the Arsenal boss has no intention of quitting the ailing Gunners just yet, even claiming his side have got what it takes to win the Champions League this season. They have been knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Bradford and the FA Cup by Blackburn, but Wenger insists Arsenal can overcome another team beginning with B tonight. They host mighty Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League. The Gunners are fi fth in the table, 21 points behind runaway leaders Manchester United and without a trophy in eight seasons. Last seasons beaten finalists Bayern are 15 points clear in the Bundesliga and have won nine domestic trophies since Arsenal last bagged silverware. But Wenger yesterday reminded his critics of Arsenals pedigree, even if it has been a long time since they have been best in show. ""In Europe you face some teams with quality  Barcelona, Real Madrid  but they dont win it every year,"" he said. ""We have been consistently there. But now we want to break through. We have been in the final (in 2006) and consistently in the quarter-final, semi-finals. In Europe, we have beaten everybody, which is what people forget. And we are the only team that has gone into a final without conceding a goal, despite the fact that we never have a good defensive record."" And of his chances of winning Europes most prestigious club competition he said: ""People will say it is not the best opportunity to do it. I think it is a fantastic opportunity, because I feel I have a strong team. And I am sure I will be right. I know if I say we will win it this season people will laugh at me because we just lost against Blackburn. But it can happen because football is not predictable or as mathematical as that. What I find absolutely unbelievable is that when it (something unpredictable) happens to me, it is a complete storm."" Chelsea showed last season that strange things do happen, winning the Champions League  beating Bayern in the final  while finishing sixth in the Premier League, 25 points adrift of Manchester City. But Wenger insisted he was not concerned about the Blues achievement. ""What is important is that you play to win the competition and at some stage you have to play a big team,"" he explained. ""If I listen to others, we are not favourites but I trust our quality, our spirit and our mental strength. It is massive for us. Not because of what happened on Saturday but because we started the season with a lot of scepticism. I think we have made improvements and it would be nice for us to continue with this improvement until the end of the season."" Wengers pre-match press conference was a strange affair yesterday. At one stage he demanded: ""Can we get some questions about tomorrows game, that would be very nice."" Then he snapped at one reporter asking about the German sides defence, saying: ""I dont talk about Bayern Munich."" But he did address the suggestion that his side are slow starters, after midfi elder Mikel Arteta had pointed out the differences between Arsenals performances before and after the break this season. The Spanish midfielder said: ""The last few big games, we missed the first 20-25 minutes and gave the opposition too much respect. Its massive because if you start well then you have a great chance to win the big games. We know we have to face them right from the off."" The table of the Premier League of first and second 45 minutes is very different. ""That shows our qualities are good, because when teams tire were able to score  but also were not ready to do what we want from the start."" Wenger backed up Arteta, saying: ""He sums it up well. We are champions of England in the second half and in the first half, no. It is psychological, but I do not necessarily want to come out more on that."" And he was eventually relaxed enough to depart with a quip, saying: ""I am sure you would miss me when I am gone!"" Sadly for the 63-year-old, a battering by Bayern could see more and more fans wanting to find out if that is true.",Raw Data
440,"CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- Creighton's third straight road game was nothing like the first two. After a pair of losses by a combined eight points, this one was wrapped up by halftime. Doug McDermott had 21 points and 10 rebounds and the 17th-ranked Bluejays shot 63 percent, bouncing back with a dominant effort in an easy 81-51 victory at struggling Southern Illinois on Sunday night. ""We've had a rough week so far,"" coach Greg McDermott said. ""So it's just good for us to get back in the win column."" Gregory Echenique added 12 points and 11 rebounds and the Bluejays (18-3, 7-2 MVC) were 12 for 20 from 3-point range with Ethan Wragge hitting his first four attempts and Jahenns Manigat going 4 for 4. Creighton also dominated on the boards with a 39-19 cushion and has won 10 straight in the series while shaking off setbacks at Wichita State and Drake. ""Those two losses hurt, real close games,"" Doug McDermott said. ""But we didn't change anything. We got back to the practice floor and did a good job of locking in."" Greg McDermott said the Bluejays played looser than the past couple of games. ""I just liked our pace. I liked what the guys did coming off the bench, I liked our attitude on the bench,"" the coach said. ""Communicate and have some fun and you'll be surprised how things will fall into place."" Desmar Jackson scored Southern Illinois' first 10 points then later on went 21 minutes without scoring before finishing with 16 for the Salukis (8-12, 1-8). Southern Illinois has lost nine of 10 under first-year coach Barry Hinson, who has a starting five with no one taller than 6-foot-5. ""When you're down, everyone wants to beat you up,"" Hinson said. ""They could have beaten us a lot worse."" As it was, the 30-point margin of defeat was the third-largest at SIU Arena, which opened in 1964, and the largest since a 33-point loss to Saint Louis in 1989. Hinson thanked coach McDermott for emptying his bench early. ""Our guys are extremely fragile right now and I think he realizes it,"" Hinson said. ""That's as good an act of sportsmanship as you can have."" Doug McDermott said he was returning the favor for an old friend. McDermott remembers when his wife was fighting breast cancer seven years ago and Hinson was at Missouri State, Hinson sent a card and flowers every 10 days. ""I hope you understand what you have in Barry Hinson,"" McDermott told reporters. ""He will light a fire under this program."" McDermott was 9 for 13, Echenique was 5 for 6 and Grant Gibbs and Manigat were a combined 9 for 9 for the Bluejays. Creighton shot 74 percent in the first half while taking an 18-point lead, reminiscent of last season's matchup at Southern Illinois in which the Bluejays shot a Missouri Valley-record 77.5 percent. McDermott, the second-leading scorer in the nation with a 23.8-point average, was 7 for 8 with a pair of 3-pointers and had 16 points in 14 minutes. ""I liked our defense to start,"" Doug McDermott said. ""I guess we were a little sloppy there to begin, but I thought we really focused on details in the scouting report. We knew everything that was coming."" Echenique scored in double figures for the first time in six games and earned his fifth double double of the season. Wragge had been a combined 5 for 18 his previous four games and totaled nine points the last two games. ""It's big,"" Doug McDermott said, ""especially with the kind of attention me and Gregory draw inside. ""You just hope when it matters, they'll continue to knock them down."" The Salukis trailed 11-10 thanks to the hot start by Jackson, who hit his first four shots with a pair of 3-pointers. But Jackson missed five of his last six in the half and Southern Illinois had no one to pick up the slack. Southern Illinois guard Jeff Early served a one-game suspension for a flagrant foul with intent to injure at Northern Iowa. ""He let our team down,"" Hinson said. ""I don't condone that.""",Raw Data
441,"President Barack Obama is a big football fan with two daughters, but if he had a son, he says he'd ''have to think long and hard'' before letting him play because of the physical toll the game takes. Obama's a noted hoops fan, but he's not the only world leader with a penchant for sports. ''I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence,'' Obama tells The New Republic. ''In some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players, and those of us who are fans maybe won't have to examine our consciences quite as much.'' In an interview in the magazine's Feb. 11 issue, Obama said he worries more about college players than he does about those in the NFL. ''The NFL players have a union, they're grown men, they can make some of these decisions on their own, and most of them are well-compensated for the violence they do to their bodies,'' Obama said. ''You read some of these stories about college players who undergo some of these same problems with concussions and so forth and then have nothing to fall back on. That's something that I'd like to see the NCAA think about.'' NFL spokesman Greg Aiello responded Sunday, ''We have no higher priority than player health and safety at all levels of the game.''",Raw Data
442,"Several drivers will be with different teams or crew chiefs in 2013, and all should benefit from the moves. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. Matt Kenseth certainly did not have a bad year he made the Chase for the Sprint Cup, and he won three races. He actually won two in the Chase, so he had a good season. But even his crew chief, Jimmy Fennig, said Joe Gibbs Racing has hit a home run getting a hold of Kenseth. I think Kenseth will be good for new teammates Kyle Busch and Denny Hamlin. He will, to some degree, become a quiet leader over there with his experience. He might indeed elevate that entire organization. Obviously, Hamlin had a great year. He won five races and also made the Chase. But still, the consistency is not there. Thats something Kenseth brings to the table consistency. Another driver on the move who should have a good season in 2013 is Joey Logano. He is going to have a good year at Penske Racing. It was time for him to move on. Logano has been with Joe Gibbs Racing for four years. Its almost as though things have been hanging over his head ever since he went there as a rookie back in 2009. Lets face it: He probably moved to the Sprint Cup Series too soon, and probably nobody knows that better than Logano. WHAT A DAY! Brad Keselowski won the title but how did the rest of the Chase field end up? NASCAR Standings But that organization was put in a box because Tony Stewart left a year earlier than expected, and team owner Joe Gibbs knew that Logano was the future of Joe Gibbs Racing. So, then, at basically 19 years old, he slid into a car that had won 37 races and had won two championships. Those were some big shoes to fill. When you look back at 2011, he lived half the season not knowing if Carl Edwards was going to take his ride or not. He lived the whole year in 2011 without, I think, the true support of crew chief Greg Zipadelli, because Zipadelli was destined to leave and go to Stewart-Haas Racing. Even if Logano had won a lot of races this year, I felt like it was time for him to move on and start with a clean slate. I think he has true support over there at Penske. Not saying he didnt have it at Joe Gibbs, but Brad Keselowski lobbied hard to get Logano to come over there at Penske and be his teammate. He lobbied with Logano, and he also lobbied with Roger Penske. I think Joey and Brad will truly complement each other. I dont see anybody who has made a move during the offseason or before the season ended that will have something new next year that it wont be positive for them. I think Kenseth is going to be better. I think Logano is going to be better. I think Edwards will have a better year next year with Fennig over there. I only see positives with everybody who made moves this year for next year.",Raw Data
443,"What tough luck for Rodney Stuckey, just two games after coming back from a toe injury while he was playing at such a high level, to injure his hamstring in the great win at Cleveland the Pistons managed to get. What he did against Washington the other night, if you look at the full 48 minutes, was tremendous. He came in favoring his sprained toe, to a degree, not knowing exactly what he was going to be able to do out there, especially for a full game. For much of the game, it looked to Greg Kelser and me like he was picking his spots. When the game was on the line, at that point he knew what his body was going to let him do and he was certainly man enough to take the ball and knock down the shot to get us a win. Right before that, he hit that huge three out of the double team on Tayshaun. One of the great things about Rodney right now is hes playing off of his teammates extremely well. In other words, as outstanding as he has been and his numbers before he hurt his hamstring and discounting the time he was out with the toe have been tremendous it hasnt been a give me the ball and get out of the way kind of performance each and every night. Its been a player who picks his spots, helps his teammates and has really thrived in a team-like situation. He and Brandon Knight have turned out to be a great combination and you cant be a great combination if youre the only one who has the ball. Brandon has had a lot of chances to do what he does best. He and Rodney have really found a way to work together extremely well. When you have a high-quality player with multiple talents like that on the floor with you, if you want you and your team to play to the maximum, you want to play well with him. Rodney has certainly done that. I think hes really turned the corner with the help of this coaching staff and the emergence of Brandon Knight, who is now a legitimate NBA starting point guard. Throw in Greg Monroes growth, Tayshauns all-around game that people almost take for granted and what Jason Maxiell has been able to do, plus the Pistons bench players, and I think Rodney is in a comfort zone like hes never been in before. And hes part of that comfort zone. Hes done the right things to make it happen. I think Rodney and Brandon can be very interchangeable. Thats tough to deal with defensively. It does remind me to a degree, anyway of Isiah and Joe. You hate to compare young players with Hall of Fame guards among the best to ever play. But, remember, early in Joe Ds career, people thought, well, maybe Joe Dumars will end up being a great point guard for somebody. As it turned out, he ended up being a great all-around guard for somebody and that somebody was the two-time champion Detroit Pistons. Because he had the capability to play off of the ball, Isiah would do that when he was hot or when Chuck thought it was the best way to attack the opposition and Joe would run the offense. Those two supremely talented guys also had off-the-charts basketball IQs. And, dont forget, what made them champions was the fact that they both relinquished a little time for one of the greatest off-the-bench guards of all-time in Vinnie Johnson. When youre in a three-guard rotation like that, you have to be great all-around players. You have to have all the skills necessary to play on the ball or off the ball and they did. Vinnie could run the offense, too, and there were times thats the way the Pistons rolled. Who knows? We might be seeing the early stages of a combination good enough to be talked about as among the best guard combinations, at least, in the NBA someday in Brandon and Rodney. Ive always seen Rodney as an engaging, friendly, positive guy who had a ton of talent. You pull for a guy like that. To a degree, hes been a man without a position. As talented as he is, that puts a lot on a player. What I like about Rodney and this coaching staff is they have found a way to make optimum use of his considerable talent. When he is allowed to do what he does best, he becomes one of the most dangerous guards in the greatest league in the world. Thats the highest compliment you could give him.",Raw Data
444,"The Pistons last week traded Tayshaun Prince, who for many seasons was a player able to do whatever a coach needed him to do. Kyle Singler is not the same player as Tayshaun, but he has a lot of those same qualities. Kyle has been a breath of fresh air in terms of being able to play most nights like a seasoned pro. You think about what Kyle brings to the table, there really are some other comparisons to Tayshaun. Tayshaun played four years under a microscope at Kentucky and was a significant contributor all four years and MVP there for two years. Here comes Kyle Singler, who played nearly 150 games in four years for Duke and they’re under the microscope as much as any team in America. This is a guy who played under pressure and clearly was able to respond to pressure and ended up being one of Duke’s all-time leading scorers. I’m sure he learned a lot along the way from Coach K and then learned plenty more over in Spain. I remember talking to George David, Pistons assistant general manager, about the league in Spain and he said, top to bottom, that’s as good a competition as there is in Europe. There are some great teams in other countries, but that’s an excellent league. So to play all those games at Duke and then go play a year in Europe in a tough league, he was ready to help when he got here. Kyle looks to me like he could clearly play three positions. They all aren’t perfect for him, maybe – I think his perfect position is probably small forward and that’s where he’s played much of his basketball career so far, I’m sure even back to his high school days in Oregon. At a legit 6-foot-8 with quickness and toughness and basketball smarts, he can in a pinch play all three of those spots – power forward, small forward and shooting guard – at both ends of the court. The fact he got his share of starts at shooting guard shows you that coach Frank and the staff felt like he had the skill set to play there. Even if he was a little bit out of position, he wouldn’t hurt you there. That’s one thing you can say about Kyle Singler – he won’t hurt you. He guards Kobe Bryant, Joe Johnson and a lot of people in between and scores on the other end himself. He makes plays. He’s not afraid to stick his nose in there and get things done around the basket. He just plays and I think any coach would love to have Kyle Singler on his team. He’s a heck of a second-round draft choice. That’s another redraft guy who would clearly be a first-round draft choice and probably a lottery pick. One of the great things about Kyle is he never stops moving. When I think about all my years in the league, I can even go back to when Doug Collins was a player for the 76ers. He never stopped moving. And because of that, with a good point guard on the court with him, he got open shots. He got layups. He found a way to score in a ton of ways. It’s not easy to be moving all the time. You’ve got to be in shape and it’s full-tilt hustle all the time. Kyle Singler brings that to the table. He’ll score when he’s on the court – he’ll score because he’ll find a way to get himself open. Whether it’s spotting up or on cuts to the basket, it all depends on what you need on that particular night. He may not see the ball as much some nights as he does others because somebody else might have it going, but with Jose Calderon at point guard and with his vision – I still think he might be the purest point guard in the league – and Kyle’s movement, I think you’ll see Jose and Kyle teaming up on some great plays. Jose is an equal-opportunity passer. If you’ve got the best shot and you’re able to score, you’re going to get the basketball – and Kyle is often going to be that guy. I’m sure there are many nights when coaches take Kyle Singler out of the game just to rest him. He almost never hurts you when he’s on the floor. More often than not, he helps you and not just a little. He doesn’t make mistakes, he makes the right play and he’s willing to give up his body to get it done on both ends. I can’t even count the times that he’s been involved – not in a cheap way – in some physical play around the basket. With his ability to shoot it and his length, he could stay out of the fray on the offensive end and still be an NBA player. But he’s more than willing to stick his nose in there and play the physical kind of basketball you have to play to help your team win in the NBA. There are guys who don’t hurt you but they don’t help you win. I think Kyle Singler is clearly a winner. Related Articles: George Blaha",Raw Data
445,"""What's the best stadium in European football?"" was the question last week when Manchester United fans visited Madrid. For some, the towering 80,000 seater Bernabeu shaded the bigger Camp Nou. It's steeper, taller, with more tiers. Stadiums were judged from the outside too, the location and the history. In America, history is what makes an old ballpark like Fenway Park or Wrigley Field so popular among the bigger, newer, corporate domes. Even the new builds try and ape the designs of the 1920s. In England, Fulham's Craven Cottage remains a favourite precisely because it's not an identikit out-of-town bowl differentiated by the colour of its seats. Craven Cottage In subsequent discussions about football stadiums, Milan's Giuseppe Meazza - the famous San Siro - emerged as a rival contender. ""It looks like it wants to fight you,"" was one assessment of the ground shared by both Milan clubs. It will stage AC Milan v Barcelona on Wednesday night, the one permanent fixture at Milan amid the continuous upheaval. Just two of the Milan players who played against Barça last season started their game at the weekend. Viewed from the outside, the giant red girders and circular stairs of the San Siro win. General view of the San Siro Camp Nou is scruffy and sunken, with a part pebbledash exterior like a 70s council house; the Bernabeu is better, but still all exposed concrete. Camp Nou They are the three venues which top polls, but there are some serious rivals. The new Wembley is viewed by UEFA as the finest in Europe. It boats a vast 90,000 capacity and more executive facilities to keep an army of prawn sandwich eaters and city boys happy. It's not yet loved though, because fans still romanticise about that ashtray once adjoined to the Twin Towers, while the new Wembley feels just that, new. It's superb though, but attachment to a stadium is bundled up with the great events which take place there over bricks and mortar. Once attachments have been formed, they're hard to shift, as Liverpool and Everton fans point out if suggestions are made for them to move or share a new stadium. Old Trafford was another UEFA five star stadium – one of 29 on a list used by UEFA up to 2006 when they redrew the rules. No stadium with a capacity of less than 60,000 has staged a Champions League final since then, but which is the best? Old Trafford is England's biggest club stadium, and, though hugely impressive, the roof swoops too low to give it the same impact of the best. Like Arsenal's Emirates or Newcastle's whatever it is called these days, it's also a true football ground, free from an athletics track which make Olympic Stadiums in Athens, Berlin, Istanbul, Rome, Moscow, Barcelona and Seville, however wonderful, not perfect for football. Just as Brazil is rebuilding 14 stadia ahead of the 2014 World Cup, so countries which have staged past events benefited from a surge in stadia investments. Portugal may be among the poorest countries in Western Europe, but it has some of the best venues after Euro 2004, including the bonkers one in Braga, which has two stands, a rock face behind one end and a forest at the other. Most of the German stadiums built for the 1974 World Cup finals were rebuilt for the 2006 edition, minus the running tracks. Munich's futuristic Allianz Arena is a groundbreaking as the original Olympic Stadium was in 1972 and was rightly awarded the Champions League final last year. The new giant or expanded grounds in Hamburg, Dortmund, Hanover and Monchengladbach - in fact most German cities with a Bundesliga team - are magnificent, but they also incorporate terracing. Allianz Arena Grounds like the Stade de France were built for France 98, epic venues like Marseille's Velodrome remodelled. It's undergoing another expansion, up to 67,000 with an imposing new 'roof of light' for Euro 2016. That would have been developed anyway, for Marseille average 50,000. The same applies in Glasgow, which is particularly well served by fine venues: Hampden, Celtic Park and Ibrox. Istanbul, too, has three top class venues, two of which are among the noisiest in world football most weeks. No country has more than Spain's five stadiums on the 2006 list – sure to be seven when Athletic Bilbao and Valencia complete their new homes. Unlike at Valencia where the work has stopped, progress at Athletic's new 53,000 cathedral continues apace and it opens in September. Being newly built is only one facet. Architectural design also counts. The imposing red brickwork exterior of the shared Stadio Luigi Ferraris in Genoa not only made it an urban art-form when it opened before Italia 90, but also the inspiration for Preston's developed Deepdale. The Camp Nou and the Bernabeu remain the best. They're steeped in history of the finest players in the world, they attract vast crowds and they're huge. The Bernabeu Both are to undergo redevelopments, with Madrid aiming to 'wrap' the Bernabeu and increase the capacity by 10,000 seats to 90,000. Despite looking like it can't go any higher, architectural minds are trying to find a way. Barcelona plan a bigger project. They were so impressed by the new 100,000 capacity Dallas Cowboys stadium in Texas in 2010 they considered copying it – though without the pink dressing room for cheerleaders. Prior to that, plans were announced around the stadium's 50th anniversary in 2007 for Sir Norman Foster to expand the capacity to 106,000 by increasing the height of the main stand, then covering and cladding the uninspiring outside of Camp Nou in a Gaudiesque terracotta exterior. It would have been a new architectural icon for a city already stuffed with design classics, but the project never broke ground and plans will be shelved by the austere new board who will struggle to justify the anticipated €250 million cost.

446,"Jen Floyd Engel, a Top 10 columnist for FoxSports.com in the 2012 Associated Press Sports Editors annual contest, had covered local sports for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram since 1997 and became a columnist in 2003 before joining Fox Sports. Sports opinions? She’s never short of them. And love her or hate her, she’ll be just another one of the boys. Follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook. Reactions after the NIH conclusion that Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) when he shot himself in the chest with a .357 Magnum in May were sadly predictable, if only because we had heard them all previously. What awful news. We need to do more to protect these guys while they play and care for them afterward. What a tragedy. Pardon my bluntness, but let’s stop with this BS. As I thought about how long we have been talking about brain trauma and football players, since at least 2009, and of how many players have sustained repeated blows to the head since then, U2’s iconic “Sunday Bloody Sunday” popped into my head. As the body count grows, how long, how long must we sing this chorus of pretending to be shocked and saddened? This outrage not only feels disingenuous. It is. We now know how debilitating CTE, a degenerative brain disease often associated with repeated blows to the head, is. And we know football is, at its core, a game of repeated blows to the head. The violence is part of the appeal. So why are we shocked that former football players are killing themselves as their brains slowly deteriorate from it? Listen, I know not everyone who plays football gets CTE, just like not everybody who smokes gets lung cancer. But evidence is mounting that playing football ups your chance for being wracked by this later in life, just as smoking does for cancer. And the issue quickly is becoming whether there is a safe amount of football. Seau was a 20-year NFL veteran and, in the wake of his suicide, many made the point that his NFL career was not marked by concussions. Those who brought it up initially did so to say, “Do not be so quick to blame brain blows.” Now that we have a causal relationship, though, his lack of concussions actually becomes scarier. It is proof a player need not be injured to be hurt. None of this is new. It is just newsy in the wake of the news of Seau. Like with gun violence, with every fresh tragedy, we talk about how change needs to happen. Then nothing happens. Until the next tragedy. This is what we do in so many areas of American life, delay payment. All we do is kick the problem a little farther down the road because doing the right thing or, at the very least, engaging in honest conversations about what the right thing is, is too damn hard. And the battle's just begun There's many lost, but tell me who has won ... Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday It was less than a week ago that Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III played on a knee the health of which renowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews questioned. Andrews was quoted going into the game as saying he was holding his breath. So why did RG3 play? Why did he continue to play after reinjuring his knee in the first quarter? Because it was the playoffs. And football thrives on this narrative of player as warrior, of honor in not abandoning your team and of needing to be dragged off the field to stop playing. Redskins coach Mike Shanahan actually expounded on this idea afterward, after RG3 had crumpled onto the field with an injury way worse than he began the game with. “I think so,” Shanahan responded when asked if the NFL players' code called for them to play through injury. “It should be. That’s the type of player that you want.” This mentality is why RG3 had surgery to repair his LCL and re-repair his ACL on Wednesday. There is plenty of blame to go around for this, from RG3 to Shanahan to us. Yes, us. Many of the same people ripping into Shanahan for not pulling RG3 were tweeting hero narratives about him when Washington led early, about two touchdowns and one knee, about his guts for playing hurt. Because by doing so he took away plausible deniability. This is the mindset of the NFL; leaders are the guys willing to put team and game above long-term health. So was what happened to Seau a tragedy, or was it a very predictable consequence of adherence to this code? And it's true we are immune When fact is fiction and TV reality And today the millions cry We eat and drink while tomorrow they die Sunday, bloody Sunday, indeed. And we have reached a point when the tragedy is not in the news of Seau killing himself or the news that he had been suffering from a degenerative brain disease likely caused by a sport we love. Rather, it is in our utter unwillingness to do anything other than talk about how sad this is.",Raw Data
447,"Haley Peters added 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Blue Devils (18-1, 8-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who won their 34th consecutive home game against ACC competition. Making her second start of the season after missing the first five games with a leg injury, Wells hit all three of her 3-point attempts and had three steals. She missed the spring semester last season while serving a suspension for violating university policy. ''I just feel grateful that I'm back and have the opportunity again,'' Wells said. ''Every day, I'm just going hard, whether it's on the court or off the court with my team, just trying to get everybody together. It's really great.'' Chelsea Gray and Tricia Liston scored 12 points apiece for Duke. Elizabeth Williams had 10 points for the Blue Devils. The Blue Devils shot 47 percent from the floor and finished with a 47-28 advantage in rebounds, improving their all-time record against the Eagles to 11-2. ''I thought we had two halves of great defense,'' Duke coach Joanne P. McCallie said. ''Offensively, we were sharp in the first half, a little bit less so in the second. But overall, I loved the offensive balance and productivity.'' Kristen Doherty scored 14 points to lead Boston College (8-11, 2-6), which lost its fourth consecutive game. Kerri Shields added 13 points and Nicole Boudreau had 11 points for the Eagles. Boston College shot 30 percent from the floor, including 6 of 24 from 3-point range. ''Duke's hands were so good,'' Boston College coach Erik Johnson said. ''They got deflections everywhere. Our drive-and-dish game, our ability to create shots for others, was clearly disrupted.'' The Blue Devils led 49-33 at halftime after shooting 56 percent from the field and making 8 of 10 3-point attempts. Liston and Wells led the charge, each shooting 4 of 4 from the floor. All four of Liston's shots were 3-pointers, including one from the left wing that capped a 9-0 run to give Duke a 28-17 lead with 8:30 left in half. Wells added a pair of 3-pointers before halftime, including a 25-footer from the right wing to beat the shot clock buzzer early in the game. ''It was definitely an energy booster,'' Wells said. ''I wasn't really focused on where I was at. I just knew the shot had to go up. I had the ball, so I let it go, and it went down for me. Definitely a lift for the team.'' Liston and Wells each made a 3-pointer during a 7-0 run that gave the Blue Devils a 40-24 lead late in the first half. The Eagles stayed within striking distance with some hot 3-point shooting of their own after Duke's initial spurt. Shields nearly duplicated the 4-for-4 effort of Liston and Wells before halftime, making three 3-pointers. Doherty also made two 3-pointers for the Eagles, who shot 5 of 11 from behind the arc in the first half. When the 3-point shooting cooled to 1 of 13 after halftime, so did Boston College's chances of rallying against the Blue Devils. ''They make you pay for every mistake you make,'' Doherty said. ''When you get in those huddles when you make a mistake, what we need to work on is not letting it affect our next play as much as we do.'' Duke honored its 2003 team, which won the ACC championship and reached the Final Four, at halftime. It marked the first time that Gail Goestenkors, who coached the Blue Devils for 15 seasons and led them to four Final Fours before leaving to coach Texas in 2007, had returned to Duke to watch a game.",Raw Data
448,"Morgan fell to the ground as Hazard attempted to get the ball from him, with the 22-year-old then trying to kick it from under him but appearing to instead make contact with the youngster. QPR manager Redknapp sympathises with Hazard and holds Morgan responsible for the incident. ""Hazard toe-poked the ball under the boy's body. Why is the kid lying on the ball in the first place?"" he said. ""You can imagine the frustration - you're a player trying to reach a cup final but there's this kid behaving like an idiot who won't give you the ball back. ""Hazard didn't kick the kid, he kicked the ball underneath him, but the whole thing got blown out of all proportion. ""I can think of a lot of players who would have kicked a bit harder than he did. He just toe-poked the ball away. ""The boy was tweeting before the game that he's a super time waster. The way he behaved was disgusting."" Morgan himself briefly broke his silence on Thursday night, tweeting: ""Crazy 24 hours. Spoke to Hazard and I will not be pressing charges. Be in touch."" ""Three calls have been received from members of the public living in Sussex, Kent and west Wales which are being followed up,"" a police spokesman said. Hazard was assumed to have avoided criminal charges when the matter was dropped after he and the teenager met and made mutual apologies. It then emerged Morgan was no mere ball-boy but the son of millionaire Swansea director Martin Morgan. Charlie's parents Martin and Luisa Morgan own almost a quarter of the Premier League club and their son enjoys a lifestyle most professional footballers would envy. Lifelong Swans fans, the Morgans amassed their £42million through owning and selling a travel agency and then investing in boutique hotels. Former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers spoke up for Morgan and suggested any possible time-wasting was ""nothing sinister"". Rodgers, who spent two years at the Liberty Stadium before moving to Liverpool last summer, joked: ""I know Charlie well. He used to do it great for me! He was taught well! ""He is a good boy. He loves his club and he loves his football."" He added: ""Don't get me wrong, ball boys are well tuned in to what is required in the game. ""There was maybe a wee bit of gamesmanship by Charlie but certainly nothing sinister. ""I think any manager, player, coach would be happy if their ball boy did that.""",Raw Data

450,"When I first signed at the University of Tennessee, I must admit, I was a little afraid. Pat Summitt was a 5-foot-10 woman who possessed a deep Southern drawl, paced the sidelines, yelled at refs and glared at her players. Rumor had it she vowed to make each of her 300-plus players cry at one point during their career, and she had! Pat Summitt is inspiring to others because of the amount of wins she's accrued (1,098), the NCAA titles she's won (eight) or the years she's been coaching (38). She inspires ME because she lives by her words and she is a model for her advice. When I first arrived on campus and received the Lady Vols' handbook I noticed a list of Pat's policies on the back, ""The Definite Dozen."" Quickly, I skimmed over them and one jumped off the page: Handle success as you handle failure. This specific policy is the most important lesson I have ever learned. During my darkest days at Tennessee I never felt alone. Coach was there when I woke up from my season-ending knee surgery. She cried alongside me as I tried to piece together my life following my parents' divorce. I always had a shoulder to lean on and words of advice to follow. Pat did as she said. The same words and advice she offered me, she followed as she publicly dealt with a divorce from her husband. In the team meeting in which she disclosed the news of her split, we were in shock at how up front and honest she was. We were a family and our leader, in the toughest times, still somehow set an example. My four years at UT flew by. Those years were filled with ups and downs, wins and losses. Following wins, Pat encouraged us to work harder and never get complacent. After losses, we graciously congratulated our opponent and went back to work on getting better. I believe Pat was successful in coaching because her work ethic is second to none. She is successful in life because she cares. In my junior and senior years we reached the pinnacle of success by winning NCAA titles. Pat reminded us to remain humble and give others credit because no one reached the top alone! I watched as Coach gave her all for the University of Tennessee. Whether Pat was signing autographs, conducting interviews or spending all day at our summer camp for little kids, she did it to the BEST of her ability. One day, I asked her how she did it all on a daily basis. Pat simply replied, ""It's easy to tell people how certain things are done. Real leaders show people how things are done."" If you ever were in doubt about how truly inspirational Pat Summitt is, look only to August 2011. Courageous and up-front, Coach Summitt announced she was battling early-onset Alzheimer's. Anyone can be inspirational in their greatest moments. Pat proves to be most inspiring in her weakest. Through her, I've truly grasped the concept ""handle success as you handle failure."" Pat Summitt is a constant, never-changing person. She possesses the same ideals and morals regardless of the circumstances. She will get on stage and celebrate life's greatest achievements, but also publicly battle life's disappointments. Pat is the embodiment of her Definite Dozen. She lives it every day. Pat's eyes can see through you. Literally! The crystal-blue circles are filled with passion, pain and power! I dare you to try to stare back at that glare. Impossible. She's the pioneer of the game, but her greatest influence isn't a result of the bouncing ball and the game she helped grow. Pat Summitt coaches her players on life, and that is why she is my inspiration.",Raw Data
451,"Relatives and angry young men rampaged through the Egyptian city of Port Said on Saturday in assaults that killed at least 27 people following death sentences for local fans involved in the country's worst bout of soccer violence. Unrest surrounding the second anniversary of Egypt's revolution also broke out in Cairo and other cities for a third day, with protesters clashing for hours with riot police who fired tear gas that encompassed swaths of the capital's downtown. The divisive verdict and bloodshed highlight challenges being faced by President Mohammed Morsi, who took office seven months ago following an Egyptian revolution that ousted autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak. Critics say Morsi has failed to carry out promised reforms in the country's judiciary and police force, and claim little has improved in the two years after the uprising against Mubarak. The Islamist leader, Egypt's first freely elected and civilian president, met for the first time with top generals as part of the newly formed National Defense Council to discuss the deployment of troops in two cities. The military was deployed to Port Said hours after the verdict was announced, and warned that a curfew could be declared in areas of unrest. The military was also deployed to the canal city of Suez, where protesters attacked the main security compound there after eight people were killed late Friday. Saturday's riot in Port Said stemmed from animosity between police and die-hard soccer fans know as Ultras, who also were part of the mass uprising against Mubarak that began on Jan. 25, 2011, and at forefront of protests against the military rulers who assumed temporary power after his ouster. It also reflected tensions after the uprising that reached into all sectors of Egyptian life, even sports. Survivors and witnesses said Mubarak loyalists had a hand in instigating last year's attack, which began Feb. 1 after Port Said's home team Al-Masry won a match, 3-1, against Cairo's Al-Ahly. Some say ''hired thugs'' wearing green T-shirts posing as Al-Masry fans led the attacks. Others say, at the very least, police were responsible for gross negligence in the Feb. 1 soccer brawl that killed 74 Al-Ahly fans. Anger at police was evident in Port Said, home to most of the 73 men accused of involvement in the bloodshed, although the trial was held outside Cairo. Judge Sobhi Abdel-Maguid did not give his reasoning when he handed down the sentences for 21 defendants. Executions in Egypt are usually carried out by hanging. Verdicts for the remaining 52 defendants, including nine security officials, are scheduled to be delivered March 9. Some have been charged with murder and others with assisting the attackers. All the defendants - who were not present in the courtroom Saturday for security reasons - can appeal the verdict. Supporters of those sentenced to death said they were being used as scapegoats. The rioters attacked the city's prison after the verdict was read live on state television to try and free the defendants. A police lieutenant and police officer were killed in the assault. Residents also focused their anger against the government, attacking a power station, the governor's office and local courthouse. They staged a sit-in along the main road leading into the city and occupied a police station. Security officials said a total of 27 people were killed and some 400 wounded, many by gunfire, throughout the city. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information. Victims were killed when police fired tear gas, bird shot and other live ammunition at the mob. Two soccer players who died- one from Port Said's Al-Marikh club and the other a former player of its Al-Masry club - apparently were killed on their way to do training near the prison. One of the players was shot three times, a local health official said. Some 220 kilometers (135 miles) away in Cairo, the divisive nature of the trial was on display. Relatives of those killed at the soccer game erupted in joy in the courtroom after the verdict was announced. Families yelled ''Allahu Akbar!'' Arabic for ''God is great'' and pumped their fists in the air. Others held up pictures of the deceased, most of whom were young men from Cairo's poor neighborhoods. One man fainted while others hugged. The judge smacked the bench several times to try to restore calm. Supporters of Cairo's Al-Ahly celebrated the verdict in the team's club before heading toward Interior Ministry headquarters, which manages the police, for more protests. Lawmakers had formed a fact-finding committee that found some evidence toward collusion from authorities, but the evidence was not conclusive. Nine of those on trial are security officials, charged with assisting the attackers for failing to search for weapons as is customary and allowing known criminals to attend the game. One was a senior officer who locked the exit designated for Al-Ahly fans. Many victims suffocated or were trampled to death in the corridor trying to escape the violence. Others were thrown off bleachers, undressed, beaten with iron bars and had the words ''Port Said'' carved into their skin. Police reform researcher Karim Ennarah said the lack of a proper investigation raises the specter that some of those on trial are innocent. The state prosecutor's office, tasked with investigating the case, was long run by a Mubarak holdover. ''We still operate in a state that doesn't hold its employees, specifically in the security sector, to account,'' Ennarah said. ''There might have been democratic elections, but it still is a very undemocratic state in terms of how police work.'' The most high profile case since Egypt's uprising was that of Mubarak himself. He was found guilty of failing to stop the killing of around 900 protesters. The verdict angered people who wanted him executed on charges of ordering deadly force. He was sentenced to life in prison in what even some of his opponents argue was a verdict based on flimsy evidence aimed at appeasing an angry public. A lawyer of one of the defendants given a death sentence Saturday said this verdict too was political. Days before the verdict, Morsi declared the victims ''martyrs of the revolution'', granting families up to $15,000 in compensation. ''There is nothing to say these people did anything and we don't understand what this verdict is based on,'' Mohammed al-Daw told The Associated Press by telephone. ''Our situation in Port Said is very grave because kids were taken from their homes for wearing green T-shirts,'' he said, referring to the Al-Masry team color. The president, once a detainee under Mubarak for his political activities with the Brotherhood, had vowed to restore security in his first 100 days in office. Instead, critics say he has waged a personal campaign against anti-Brotherhood figures rather than carry out comprehensive reform. His Muslim Brotherhood allies blamed ''misleading'' media outlets for enflaming the public against the government. The main opposition bloc said it holds Morsi responsible for ''the excessive use of force by the security forces against protesters.'' Fans of Al-Ahly, mostly young men in their teens, promised more violence in the days leading up to the verdict if the death penalty was not handed down. Their main Facebook page had called for bloodshed. ''This was necessary,'' said Nour al-Sabah, whose 17-year-old son Ahmed Zakaria died in last year's melee. ''Now I want to see the guys when they are executed with my own eyes, just as they saw the murder of my son.'' ''We are not really that happy,'' Mohamed Ahmed, a survivor of the attack, said. ''The government helped the Ultras of Port Said by blocking the gates of the stadium until people suffocated to death.'' Meanwhile, Port Said resident and activist Rasha Hammouda said the city wants those involved in killings to be brought to justice. ''We have no problem with execution of those who killed, but bring everyone who is involved,'' she said.",Raw Data
452,"LOS ANGELES Welcome to Lakerland, where the working motto is now: another day, another bombshell. Just when it seemed inevitable that Phil Jackson would ride to the rescue after the Lakers shocked the NBA by firing Mike Brown five games into the season, they pulled an even more astonishing move late Sunday night by hiring Mike D'Antoni as coach. The deal, for three years and $12 million with a team option for a fourth year, was first reported by the Los Angeles Times. In any another instance, bringing in D'Antoni, one of the NBA's sharpest offensive minds, to team with Steve Nash and the rest of the Lakers' A-listers, would have been a great coup three weeks into the season when so few top coaches are on the market. But coming as it did with Kobe Bryant giddy about the prospects of being reunited with Jackson and Staples Center fans breaking into ""We Want Phil"" chants during Sunday night's 103-90 victory over Sacramento this will not go over well. Nor should it. If the deal fell apart because the Lakers would not meet Jackson's demands, be it more money (a reported $10-12 million per season) or more authority in personnel matters, then both sides screwed this up. Jackson, who waited a year to become the Lakers coach in 1999 because they would not meet his price, might have walked into another team that was equipped to win a championship, just as he had previously in Chicago and Los Angeles. And if he really did want to coach again, returning to the Lakers would not have required him to move he lives a 10-minute drive from the team's offices. But the Lakers will pay a heavier toll. They are already on the hook for $13 million to Brown they'll be paying D'Antoni less and now they will find out just how much it will cost them not to have hired Jackson. The Lakers have a rich new television contract with Time Warner and short of insisting they re-sign Derek Fisher, what could be so egregious about having a say in personnel? For a franchise that is about being all-in to win a championship the Lakers customarily have the league's highest payroll the notion that they did not want to open up the coffers (or hand over the reins) for Jackson will have an immediate effect. It means D'Antoni's honeymoon should last all the way until . . . the Lakers lose a game. Kobe Bryant said he would approve of D'Antoni's hiring he worked with him during the last two Olympics but it was clear the way he gushed over Jackson, calling him ""a genius,"" where his preference lie. It will also put to the test an assertion Bryant made Sunday after the victory over the Kings. ""Nothing concerns me about this organization,"" Bryant said when asked about the coaching search. ""They always seem to make the right decision."" D'Antoni was brilliant in Phoenix, where he coached Nash to two MVP awards, and his up-tempo offense heavily influenced the rest of the league. In New York, after a rebuilding effort seemed to be headed in the right direction, the Knicks dealt for Carmelo Anthony who never respected D'Antoni's point guard-centric system enough to play defense for him. He resigned midway through last season. ""Obviously, I think everyone knows how much I love Mike,"" Nash said. ""If he were the coach, it would be seamless and terrific for me, and I think the team as well."" Nash spoke earlier Sunday evening, when the prospect of Jackson not being coach seemed unlikely to him, to the crowd, or to anyone else who believed in the Lakers capacity for theater. Now that D'Antoni is the coach, the Lakers had better hope their point guard is right.",Raw Data
453,"Manchester Uniteds last 16 Champions League tie against Real Madrid at Old Trafford on March 5 could be decided by a supremely talented Portuguese winger - however, it might not be the one youre thinking of. Nanis performance in Mondays FA Cup win over Reading, coming off the bench to open the scoring before delivering a pinpoint cross for Javier Hernandez, was a reminder of what he is capable of. The Portuguese was touted as one of the hottest properties in world football when he signed for United from Sporting Lisbon in 2007 aged 20. Scroll down for video... Staking his claim: Nani celebrates after a match winning performance against Reading in the FA Cup But at the age of 26, when many thought he would be tearing Premier League defences wide open like his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani remains infuriatingly inconsistent. His time may already be up. Nani did not even make the squad for Uniteds first leg trip to Madrid, which finished 1-1, and the impending arrival of Wilfried Zaha suggests his career at Old Trafford could be coming to an end. If he wants to save it, he must show more of the form he displayed against Reading and less of the underwhelming performances that have seen him start just one league game since September. The parallels with Ronaldo are hard to ignore. Nani is still like the Ronaldo that arrived at United from Sporting Lisbon the Ronaldo who never grew up. The diving, the preening, the lack of end product Ronaldo curbed all of these to become what would be in any other era the best footballer on the planet. One trick pony? Nani has failed to live up to his potential at Old Trafford But Ferguson knows what he still has on his hands with Nani. Speaking after the Reading game, the United manager said: Hes got great talent, we know that. I had a feeling he would win the game for us. You could see he was right on form the moment he came on. He had two great strikes immediately and was a threat to them the whole night. Its a good addition. If he keeps that form it makes my job more difficult now. Whether that praise translates into an increased role in the squad of the Premier League champions elect, or a role in the Madrid game on March 5 remains to be seen, but Nani did not do himself any harm last night. Standing in the shadows: Nani was billed as the man to step into Cristiano Ronaldo's shoes after his move his Real Madrid The other player United signed from Portugal at the same time as him, Anderson, has suffered from even more inconsistency, and his purchase must go down as a failure. It would be harsh to rule Nani the same, and it was Anderson who echoed his managers thoughts on the wingers performance. Everybody knows the quality of Nani, the Brazilian said. I know he sometimes does not play but when he does he is important for the team. He won the game for us and he was very important. This match-winning ability harks back to two seasons ago, when he was voted Players Player of the Year at Old Trafford after topping the Premier League assist charts with 14 and scored 10 goals in all competitions. Point to prove: Wilfried Zaha's summer arrival from Crystal Palace could stills see Nani leave Old Trafford It seemed Nani was finally becoming one of Uniteds most effective players but he has tailed off, although his cross to set up Hernandez against Reading was a reminder of his ability. And more performances like the FA Cup win could see him still play a role, perhaps even prolonging his stay, one which could even have ended last summer when a move to Zenit St Petersburg was on the cards. His lack of consistency is a massive factor in Uniteds willingness to sell him and the distinction between Nani and Antonio Valencia is clear. Flipping hell! Nani has the talent to play at the very top but has consistently frustrated Unite fans Ferguson has used players like Valencia, Park Ji-sung and John OShea good, consistent players, but not possessing Nanis ability to get United over the line in competitions.

Almost two years ago, Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis sat down with a fellow Baltimorean to try to reach him. The guy was struggling. He had once been a legend in his field, yet his motivation had waned. The results were not there, and he was trying to figure out if he wanted to keep going or quit. The guy was Michael Phelps, and what Lewis told him at least partially propelled him to London and an Olympic record for more gold medals than anybody else and certified G.O.A.T. status. “You don’t give up on your talent. You can’t,” was how Phelps relayed Lewis’ message when we talked at a pre-Olympic meet in February. He was back by then, a final push for greatness. I was reminded of what Phelps said Wednesday when Lewis announced his plans to retire from the game after the season. Because, as usually happens with endings, debate began about what exactly will be the enduring legacy of Lewis. It seems obvious. Because what Lewis did exceptionally well, better than stalking a quarterback or taking down a running back or tackling with ferocity, all of which he was great at, was to get more out of the people around him than they believed they had in them. The real talent was his ability to bring people along, either by force of will or strapping them to his back or, more often than not, making them believe they could do what he needed. It is not that simple for everybody. I realize this. For some, his name will forever be associated with a double homicide. There is no doubt he was involved in the incident that left two men dead after the 2000 Super Bowl. What he ended up pleading guilty to was obstruction of justice, though, he has been accused of a bigger role in the years since. Whatever his involvement was — and none of us know for sure — Lewis absolutely used that as his come-to-Jesus moment. There has been an effort to use his life and his talent and his wealth for good since that fateful night. He has, by all accounts, become a good man. Whether this evens the ledger is not for us to decide. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. Lewis is a complicated character for exactly this reason. He does not fit neatly into our narratives. He is not a thug, nor is he a choir boy. He is complicated. He has made mistakes and come back stronger. He has won a championship yet is as hungry as ever. He is retiring, but he is not done. If ever there was a player who would rage against the dying of the light, it is Lewis. The eulogies and eloquent praises of his legacy probably should wait until the Ravens’ season ends. They are a long shot to advance beyond this weekend. It is exactly those shots that Ray Lewis always convincing people they can make. It would not surprise me in the least if part of the timing of the announcement was as a motivational tool for a wilting Baltimore team. And if he were to call Phelps, my guess is the swimmer would tell him. It is not over when they say it is. It is over when you do.",Raw Data

458,"“Rory plays a game now that not many of us can match,” he said. It wasn’t so long ago that such genuflecting was reserved for Tiger Woods. But as the golf season draws to an end, it’s McIlroy who has won the PGA of America’s Player of the Year title, holds the world No. 1 by a safe margin, has claimed the money titles on both the US and European tours and is a lock to win the PGA Tour Player of the Year. It’s true that it all looked so different on July 1, when Woods won his third tournament, the AT&T National, and McIlroy was mired in a slump. But after that, Woods couldn’t close — he finished outside the top 11 only once in seven of his last eight tournaments without winning — and a rejuvenated McIlroy went on a tear, winning the PGA Championship as well as two FedEX Cup playoff events. So to the victor, the spoils. As Woods used to like to remind us, it’s all about the “W’s,” and Rory finished with four, including a major. To rub salt into the wound, Woods can’t even claim the PGA Tour Comeback Player of the Year award because they’re not giving one out this year. So he’ll spend the winter like a Cubs fan, muttering, “Wait till next year.” But what will 2013 bring? Woods is certainly still good enough to reclaim his throne. His long game has improved greatly, and the scrambling is coming around. He needs to find a way to hit wedges closer and remember how to will those 6-footers into the hole. The difference now, however, is that Woods’ fate isn’t entirely in his own hands. Whether he gets back to the top will depend on McIlroy, whose game is every bit as good as that of his boyhood hero’s. Will there be a sophomore slump, or will he keep getting better? McIlroy, who’s all but officially joined Woods in the Nike stable — securing his future to the tune of at least $200 million — will be the hunted, not the hunter, which changes the psychology. David Duval, for instance, couldn’t find motivation once he reached No. 1 and proceeded to fall off the face of the Earth. Padraig Harrington won three majors — though while Woods was recovering from knee surgery — but his reaction to that success was to tinker even more with his swing. And Harrington kept fiddling as his putting went south, followed by his world ranking. Woods was impervious to such issues as golf’s king for more than a decade, but it helped that not only was his game suited to the task, but so was his personality. Is Rory’s? He’s not the bloodthirsty type and doesn’t seem nearly as driven as Woods was at 23. But he’s such a prodigious talent, he might not need the Sunday afternoon death stare. He won two majors by eight shots each smiling the entire way. Given the way he rolled his eyes when asked about Nick Faldo’s view that champions need to be “aloof” in order to win, it’s safe to say McIlroy won’t be going to the dark side anytime soon. “I just want to try to keep improving as a player,” he said this week in Hong Kong. “Picking up these awards at the end of the year is always a nice honor, and it's very special, and looking ahead to next year, yeah, I just want to keep improving, keep trying to become a better golfer. If I can do that, then, hopefully, the tournament wins will come and more majors will come with that, also. “I'm not putting any sort of goals or targets out there. I just want to keep trying to get better.” What happens when a rising golf superstar and a top tennis player start dating? A romance that spans the globe. In his favor is the fact that he’s not — like Woods — obsessed with swing mechanics. McIlroy knows his swing is good and has focused on getting the ball in the hole in the fewest number of strokes, something Woods once did better than anyone. “We are always trying to improve,” McIlroy said. “That doesn't necessarily mean that you have to overhaul your game or try and change your swing in any way. Just make improvements on different aspects of the game, whether that be your bunker play or your chipping from semi rough or your ability to hit the shot left to right or right to left.” Harrington doesn’t see McIlroy backpedaling next season. ""He used to surprise us when he first turned pro, but I don’t think anything Rory does surprises us anymore,” the Irishman said. Then there’s always the chance that McIlroy’s challenge becomes easier because he’ll never see the best of Woods, as Faldo predicted in a radio interview this week. Faldo said that Woods hasn’t truly recovered from the humiliation of the tabloid scandal that ravaged his life. “(The revelations) have done more damage than people would give them credit for,” Faldo told the BBC. “It’s wrecked that wonderful tranquility you get of going to a golf course, tipping out a bag of balls and hitting them from 9 to 5 and just thinking of golf. “He has shattered that peace. He won’t get that back. Once you lose that concentration and that ability to become completely engrossed in your golf . . . then slowly things have changed for him. “His swing — physically, technically, mentally, karma — it’s a harder climb right now. “Sure, he could come back and do things, but he won’t be dominant like he was.”",Raw Data

He wanted me to ask though because he really wants this to happen.” This was from a student in a class of fourth, fifth and sixth graders I talked to Monday in Dallas, and perfectly summarizes the blissful myth that is Sean Payton. Yet every single media person began connecting dots anyway, sending Payton to Dallas and thereby Dallas back to glory because of a confluence Sunday of another ugly Cowboys loss, news of the NFL voiding Payton’s contract in New Orleans thus making him a possible free agent by the end of the year, his home in Westlake, Texas where his kids reside year round, and his history as a Cowboys assistant coach with a good working relationship with Jones. He once, somewhat infamously, talked a waiter at St. Elmo in Indy to give his Saints party (celebrating that Super Bowl victory) a bottle of wine reserved for Jerry Jones. He also left a note: Who Dat! Sean Payton You have to know Jerry to understand how much he loved this. He loves lower guts. And he love, love, loves Payton. He regrets that Payton got away to New Orleans in 2006. He had hoped to keep him as Bill Parcells’ replacement and watching Payton win a Lombardi Trophy in New Orleans absolutely eats at Jerry. He’d love a chance to have Payton back in Dallas, even if this meant tossing his guy, Jason Garrett, off and under the Cowboy bus. And absolutely, Payton would love to coach the Cowboys. What I know for sure about the suspended Saints coach from my time covering him in is he certainly has enough ego — in a good way — to handle coaching in the bubble that ensconces America’s Team. He also likes Jerry, got along well with him while coaching in Dallas and would love the challenge of returning the Cowboys to glory. So why is this the single worst idea ever? Because it has zero chance of working. It would destroy the reputation of a really good coach in Payton, and give Jones political cover to say, “See, I really am trying to win.” Matt Mosley wonders how comfortable Cowboys coach Jason Garrett can be with Sean Payton a coaching free agent. And it could conceivably work for a couple of years. To get Payton to Dallas, Jerry Jones would have to make some promises. He’d promise to give Payton final say on the 53-man roster, to not needlessly meddle, to not “T.O.” all of the hard work in rebuilding this franchise. The phrase “to T.O.” is from Bill Parcells’ time in Dallas. Jones had hired Parcells in a wave of desperation in 2003. He needed a stadium built and thus needed credibility. So he hired Parcells and ceded control on just about every major football decision to him. Until he simply could not help himself. Parcells had built a solid foundation in Dallas, drafting players like Jason Witten, DeMarcus Ware and Jay Ratliff and bringing in Tony Romo. He had established this core of talent. Then Jerry, over Parcells’ most stringent objections, went and signed Terrell Owens. Parcells should have quit then. He did not, muddling through an awful season and leaving later under this revised history version of events that he had failed. When really, Jerry had failed him. In a very candid moment, Parcells talked about how in a couple of years you will barely know he was here. He was wrong. It did not take that long at all. The thing is, as he is hiring coaches, Jerry really does plan to change. A couple of years ago, when Jerry introduced Wade Phillips, he teared up. He talked about having to get it right this time, and Jerry will stay true to this for a couple of years, like he did with Parcells and Jimmy Johnson before him. What we also know for sure is Jerry eventually will be Jerry again. And if Johnson and Parcells were unable to keep Jerry’s impact to a minimum or for any length of time, what chance does Payton really have? Should Jerry hire Payton? Hell yes, and I say this as somebody who likes Cowboys coach Jason Garrett. Should Payton leave New Orleans for Dallas? Hell yes. There is a reason Parcells compared the Cowboys to the big stage in Vegas. It is the most relevant NFL job there is. Could it happen? Yes. Will it work? Unlikely. Unless Payton is allowed to bring his GM.",Raw Data
460,"Just when it appeared the Los Angeles Lakers had escaped their season-long drama — even if just for a few days — a report surfaced Tuesday that Dwight Howard mocked Kobe Bryant behind his back in the locker room during All-Star Weekend in Houston. According to the New York Post, a source said Howard ""grabbed Kobe’s uniform, put it on, and imitated him in front of all the other players on the West team,” including the Clippers' Chris Paul and Blake Griffin and the Thunder's Kevin Durant. The report also claims that after arriving in the locker room, Bryant “said hello to everyone on the team except Howard, grabbed his stuff and moved as far away from Howard as he could,"" according to the source. While there may be validity to the report, it isn't the first time Howard has jokingly mocked Bryant. In his introductory press conference with the Lakers, Howard amused the media with a spot-on impression of Bryant during a phone call. Then in November, while on a plane following a loss to the Sacramento Kings, Howard hopped on the intercom system and gave a quick team speech, playfully mocking a ""75-year-old"" Bryant. In January, after the New York Daily News reported that the two nearly came to blows following a New Year's Day loss, and just after Bryant reportedly agreed with Shaquille O'Neal's comments labeling Howard ""soft,"" Bryant and Howard both took to social media to make light of the situation. Each posted a photo of the two in a staged pre-fight showdown with Mike D'Antoni separating them. ""The mamba vs d12!! It's on lol,"" said Bryant on Twitter. Regardless of their relationship behind closed doors, there has been no shortage of drama between Bryant and Howard. Following a recent ESPN report that had Bryant quoted as saying, ""we don't have time for [Howard's shoulder] to heal. We need some urgency,"" Howard and his father were quick to speak out. ""He's not a doctor,"" said Howard in a Los Angeles Times report. Added Howard's father in an interview with the Atlanta-Journal Constitution: ""I understand what Kobe was trying to do, but he went about it the wrong way. He's trying to win a championship. But Dwight has to tell Kobe, 'I appreciate your opinion, but that doesn't matter. We're two men on this team. We need to be reasonable about this.'"" The drama continued going into All-Star break, when after a 125-101 loss against the Clippers, an angry Bryant said, ""we lose by 20 or 30 points, we definitely can't be laughing and joking around."" Bryant never specified who his comments were directed toward, but a FOX Sports Ohio report surfaced this weekend with sources saying Bryant would back GM Mitch Kupchak should he decide to trade Howard. -Natalie Venegas",Raw Data

462,"﻿Can you believe there were actually people who thought I was dumb enough to fight you? My nickname is Big Diesel, not Big Dummy. Sincerely, 10. It’s obvious Jim Harbaugh has a guilty conscience about benching Alex Smith. That’s the only explanation for Harbaugh’s bizarre statement about Smith still being San Francisco’s starting quarterback. Football on Thanksgiving is an American tradition and we have the best images those games and all of Week 12. Harbaugh put every egg into the Colin Kaepernick basket. If this doesn’t work, if the 49ers fizzle in the playoffs because of an offensive letdown, Harbaugh’s credibility with players in his locker room and across the league will take a hit. Players hate coaches who lie, which means players hate coaches. Being the head coach often forces a person to lie. As it relates to Alex Smith, Harbaugh has been playing games with the truth since the offseason, since he “evaluated” Peyton Manning. Now Harbaugh is “evaluating” Colin Kaepernick. Harbaugh needs to stick to his guns and just admit Kaepernick is his quarterback. Harbaugh can’t turn back from the decision. The “damage” is done. The only thing that will fix Harbaugh’s credibility problem is a trip to the Super Bowl. Winners don’t lie. They say and do what’s necessary to win. 9. Now that I’m stuck with this Cowboys-Super Bowl prop bet, the Redskins are my new NFC Super Bowl sleeper. Pierre Garcon could be the stretch-run difference-maker the Redskins need. With Garcon healthy and joining Santana Moss and Josh Morgan, the Shanahans now have the weapons necessary to maximize Robert Griffin III. The Redskins get their crack at the Giants on Monday night this week. A victory and Washington is .500 and everyone’s sexy pick to a make playoff run. The value in buying a Redskins-Super Bowl prop bet lasts about five more days. 8. Thank God “MNF” gets a significant game this week. I actually felt sorry for Mike Tirico and Jon Gruden this week calling the Philly-Carolina exhibition. Tirico and Gruden probably thought it was Thursday and they were at the NFL Network. The game was that bad. I know, before the season Michael Vick vs. Cam Newton probably sounded like a great matchup. I wonder if there’s a way to provide some flexibility to the Monday night schedule. I hate ending the football weekend with a stinker. 7. Why did the Ravens need a fourth-and-29 conversion to beat the San Diego Chargers? I’m happy for Ray Rice and the Ravens. The highlight of his catch and run will be shown over and over again for years to come. But this is my problem with the Ravens. The Chargers stink. They have a lame-duck head coach. The game shouldn’t have been close. John Harbaugh made his bones as a special-teams coach. Every time I watch the Ravens, they remind me of a team coached by a special-teams coach. Special teams are about energy and effort, not necessarily X's and O's. The Ravens are schematically challenged. Brian Kelly would be the perfect coach for the Ravens. 6. Ndamukong Suh should be happy there’s a debate over whether he’s a “dirty” player. If not for discussion of his controversial tactics, people would focus on the fact that he’s an average defensive lineman. Watching Suh on the same field with Houston’s electrifying JJ Watt hammered home the point of Suh’s ineffectiveness. Watt is a master at using every tool in his toolbox. He uses his hands, his quickness, his strength, his leaping ability, his instincts, whatever. Most plays, Suh simply relies on his girth and strength. He’s very inconsistent with how he uses his hands. Of course, Suh’s biggest play on Thanksgiving was his “accidental” kick to the groin of Houston quarterback Matt Schaub. I agree with the league that the replay of Suh’s kick was inconclusive in terms of justifying a suspension. But all the talk surrounding the kick overshadowed Suh’s zero-tackle day. He was credited with five QB hits/pressures. Two or three of those pressures came on screen plays when Suh slipped by offensive linemen who intentionally let him slip by. Meanwhile, JJ Watt recorded five tackles, three sacks, four tackles for loss, two passes defensed and five QB pressures. 5. Of Jim Schwartz’s many Thanksgiving crimes — including abandoning his running game and needlessly challenging a scoring play — the worst was his decision to settle for a 47-yard field-goal attempt on third down in the fourth quarter. This is like hitting a popular meat market at 10 p.m. and heading home at 10:30 p.m. with the drunk girl/guy you did your first shot with. It’s just way too high risk. It says way too much about both of you. You’re a loser and he/she has some serious issues. My point is: Jim Schwartz is a loser. 4. Jason Campbell, Charlie Batch and Byron Leftwich might make NFL teams rethink the value in having a veteran backup quarterback. A veteran backup QB is, generally speaking, someone else’s failure. He’s someone another team decided it couldn’t win with. The QB is so important to an NFL team’s success that I now believe every team should draft a QB in the first three rounds every year. A veteran who can digest an entire playbook is an asset to the offensive coordinator. Making life easy on the offensive coordinator is not the key to winning games in the NFL. Having someone who can make plays from under center is the key to winning games. Mike Shanahan looks smart for drafting RG3 and Kirk Cousins. 3. Christian Ponder had as much to do with the Bears’ resurgent performance as Jay Cutler. The Bears crushed the Vikings by 18 points, and the big postgame talking point was how much better the Bears are with Cutler at QB. Yes, Cutler is light years better than Jason Campbell. But Cutler threw for 188 yards, one TD and one INT last week. Ponder averaged 3.7 yards per pass attempt. He had a QB rating of 58.2. The Bears have yet to secure a signature victory. Green Bay, Houston and San Francisco combined to outscore Chicago 68-23. Don’t be surprised if the road-weak Seahawks upset the Bears at Soldier Field. 2. A simple question: Why doesn’t the NFL adopt the college rule of a play being over once the ballcarrier hits the ground — whether he’s touched or not? If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: Many of the most dangerous hits in football occur when defenders launch themselves in a desperate attempt to make contact as a ballcarrier is on the ground or is headed toward the ground. Adopting the college rule seems like an easy way to enhance NFL safety. College football should adopt some of the clock rules used in the NFL. For instance, the clock shouldn’t stop after a first down. A college game lasts about 30 minutes (15 to 30 plays) longer than an NFL game. Why are amateur football players playing more snaps than the pros? 1. Here’s my weekly plea that AP MVP voters keep an open mind and consider the dominant performances being turned in by JJ Watt and Von Miller. Watt is back atop my ballot. The Texans are 10-1. Watt is the best 3-4 defensive end since Bruce Smith. I don’t remember Smith playing inside as much as Watt. Watt is Smith and Howie Long rolled into one package. Matt Ryan is my second choice. I downgraded Matty Ice after his five-INT performance a couple of weeks ago. But, again, the Falcons are 10-1 and their record in one-possession games is ridiculous. The one-point victory over the Buccaneers just adds to Ryan's legend. Tom Brady has thrown just three interceptions. We take Brady’s greatness for granted. He’s not getting much MVP buzz, but he deserves it. He’s on pace for 35 TDs and four INTs. That’s just incredible. Peyton Manning looked used and tired against the Chiefs. Von Miller looked used and tired against the Chiefs. My point is the Broncos just went through the motions this week and squeaked past the worst team in football.",Raw Data

464,"﻿Barcelona's thrilling 4-2 win at Málaga on Thursday night saw Lionel Messi and company into the Copa del Rey semi-finals, setting up a rare ‘Copa Clasico’ and a meeting against their nemesis, Real Madrid. The Catalans now head for the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu next week, to take on their archrivals in what is expected to be a fiery two-legged encounter. Atletico Madrid will take on Sevilla in the cup’s other semifinal, but no mistake: the meeting between Real and Barcelona has been eagerly awaited in Spain ever since the Copa bracket was drawn last October. To get here, Barca swatted aside Alavés, Córdoba and eventually overcame Málaga, Andrés Iniesta and Messi striking late to send Tito Vilanova's side through 6-4 on aggregate. Madrid made easy work of Alcoyano, Celta Vigo and Valencia without too many problems. Madrid booked their place on Wednesday with a 1-1 draw in Valencia, a game it was never in danger of losing despite two red cards and goalkeeper Iker Casillas suffering a hand injury. Los Blancos’ fans were already salivating at the prospect of meeting Barcelona, making midfielder Xabi Alonso's attempts to play down the matchup unconvincing: “I don’t mind who we get,” he claimed, a line few believed. Alonso’s attempts to keep things low key lasted only hours. First came injury news that Casillas would miss both semi-finals as well as Madrid’s upcoming Champions League round of 16 clashes with Manchester United. That was soon overshadowed by a cover story in Thursday’s Marca, which claimed club captain Casillas and teammate Sergio Ramos had issued an ultimatum to president Florentino Perez regarding manager Jose Mourinho. Next summer, “either he goes or we go” claimed the paper. Perez reacted furiously, calling a press conference at the Bernabeu on Thursday lunchtime to denounce the story as “lies” spread to “destabilize the club.” A statement from Ramos and Casillas followed, saying that both men wanted “to show our support for our coach, Jose Mourinho, for whom we have the greatest respect.” Madrid’s two most senior players do surely respect their formidable boss, but few believe they agree with what he says and does. Both men have been dramatically dropped from the starting team this season. Recent weeks also brought spats with Mesut Özil, Ángel Di María, Pepe and even Cristiano Ronaldo as Mourinho – apparently – is trying to provoke a reaction from his under-performing players. Things have been quieter at Barcelona, but not as serene as they really should be given Tito Vilanova's seamless replacement of his former boss Pep Guardiola. The first worry came in December when Vilanova underwent surgery for the second time in just over a year to remove a saliva gland tumour. The procedure went well, but ongoing treatment in New York means he was not in Malaga on Thursday, and is unlikely to attend at the Bernabeu next midweek. Ten days ago came the bombshell that long-serving Barca keeper Víctor Valdés wished to leave. Next there was a shaky performance in the Copa quarter-final first leg against Málaga, and a first league defeat of the season (2-3 at Real Sociedad). Suddenly Tito’s Barca, a side that had seemed invincible, looked beatable. Despite the trouble in both camps, nothing focuses minds at either club like a Clásico. In the thirty months since Mourinho joined Madrid, the teams have met 14 times, with the pendulum swinging back and forth and back again, and individual genius from either Ronaldo or Messi often making the difference. Messi may have won the 2012 FIFA Ballon D’Or, but Ronaldo has edged his rival recently on the field. The Portuguese decided last season’s vital La Liga meeting, as well as in the 2012 Spanish Supercopa and 2011 Copa del Rey finals. Honors were shared however during their last meeting, a 2-2 La Liga thriller that saw both men score twice. Since then Barcelona has built a commanding 15-point lead over their rivals, while Real Madrid - not surprisingly considering all the squabbles - has slipped off the pace. (Adding salt to the wound is the fact that Real’s cross-town rivals, Atletico Madrid, are a full seven points ahead of them, good enough for second in the league race) That just makes Real’s need to win these Copa games - and prove it can still match its Catalan rivals - all the greater. Cynics might say that so many clashes in such little time deadens their impact, that familiarity breeds not the contempt of a few years ago, but tedium. When asked on Tuesday whether he shared this opinion, Barca midfielder Cesc Fábregas smiled. ""Bored of Clasicos?"" he said. ""I don't think so. They are special, incomparable with any other game. The feeling in those days is just something else. It could be the Copa del Rey, the Champions League or the Copa Comarcal. You just approach it in a different way than any other game."" Fábregas is not alone in this sentiment. To the Bernabéu.

The Spaniard spent seven months out of tennis but has now won two events in three weeks after also claiming the Brazil Open title in February. Nadal, 26, defeated 30-year-old countryman Ferrer 6-0 6-2 in Acapulco. Rafael Nadal's return to tennis February - Chile Open (runner-up) February - Brazil Open (winner) March - Mexican Open (winner) ""I've had some difficult months, especially during my time away from tennis, but I feel good,"" said Nadal. ""I have to thank my family and everyone involved in my rehabilitation. It has been a difficult time over the last few months."" Former world number one Nadal, now fifth in the rankings, needed only 65 minutes to claim his 38th clay court tournament victory and 52nd ATP Tour title. He won 81% of his first-serve points against Ferrer and saved both break points he faced. Nadal has now won 12 of his 13 matches since returning to the sport after recovering from a torn tendon and maintained his record of never losing against a Spanish player in a final. ""I want to congratulate Rafa. He is not an easy player to beat,"" said world number four Ferrer. ""If I have to lose I am happy to lose to Rafa."" Nadal also confirmed he would play in next week's Indian Wells hard-court tournament in America, despite speculation he might miss the event to protect his knee.

466,"Four nights after a stunning 27-point victory against top-ranked Duke, the Hurricanes saw their 9-point lead dissipate to 2 after a 3-point jumper by Florida State's Terry Whisnant with 3:17 left in the first half. That's when Miami's Jim Larranaga called a 30-second timeout. What was the coach's message? ""Keep playing hard, keep doing what we were doing,"" guard Trey McKinney Jones said. ""Keep playing hard on defense, locking down and playing together."" What resulted was a 9-0 Hurricanes' run that grabbed control of the game en route to a 71-47 victory on Sunday night before a second-consecutive sellout crowd at the BankUnited Center. Larranaga said the run right before halftime was ""a good sign"" for his team, and not just for the obvious score change. ""We had a couple of guys in foul trouble, and you don't want to go into the half with guys tentative to play defense in the second half because they're worried if they foul, they'll be sitting on the bench,"" Larranaga said. ""Guys do worry about their playing time. ""So what happens is, I have to rely on guys who don't play significant numbers of minutes."" Ahead 30-26 with 2:29 remaining in the half, Larranaga inserted reserve guard Erik Swoope for center Reggie Johnson. ""(Swoope) only played 8 minutes, but those two minutes that he played in the first half were huge,"" Larranaga said. ""(FSU) had had cut it to 2, we had a couple of guys with two fouls and we wanted to protect them because the officials were calling some quick fouls."" Swoope's presence enabled Miami to trap and help force a couple of turnovers that sparked what proved to be a decisive run. Potential letdown avoided. Second-straight lopsided home victory secured. A large jump in the rankings expected for the No. 25 Hurricanes. Miami (15-3, 6-0) maintained a two-game lead in the Atlantic Coast Conference race. It now faces road games at Virginia Tech on Wednesday and North Carolina State on Saturday. ""I know in the beginning of the year, when we wrote our goals, we never had beating No. 1 Duke in there. We want to win the ACC,"" said forward Kenny Kadji, who scored 11 points. Barring unforeseen negative events, there's no reason the Canes shouldn't contend for both the regular-season and tournament league titles. They're experienced, they have an inside-outside attack, and they have, according to FSU coach Leonard Hamilton, the ACC's best point guard in sophomore Shane Larkin. ""They have benefitted and they've gained wisdom from the challenges they've had to go through the last couple of years — they've been coming close,"" Hamilton said. ""If they stay focused and can avoid injuries, this team can do great things this year."" Don't tell that to Larranaga, a master of addressing one game at a time. ""The expression is, ‘The past is history, the future is a mystery, but they call it the present because it's a gift,'"" Larranaga said. ""We want to stay in the present and focus on this gift we've been given."" Hamilton had an experienced team last year, when the Seminoles won their first ACC Tournament crown. This season, a younger Florida State (11-8, 3-3) team has been inconsistent. It also lost redshirt junior and leading rebounder Terrance Shannon (8.5 ppg., 6.3 rpg.) to a neck injury suffered in a Jan. 19 loss at Virginia. ""I'll be surprised if he comes back,"" Hamilton said. ""It's the second time he's had that type of injury and we're going to be extremely cautious."" The Hurricanes, meanwhile, are as healthy as they've been all season. The team's chemistry and execution clearly have benefited from the veteran players working together during the summer. ""Most importantly, we're having fun,"" said McKinney Jones, who scored a game-high 15 points. ""If we come out, play together and have fun, we're going to be a tough team to beat."" Others agree. TV analyst and former Duke star Jason Williams called Miami a potential Final Four team during the game. ""If we're still playing in April, "" Larranaga said, ""then he's right.""",Raw Data

468,"﻿Jamie Trecker is the senior editor for FOXSoccer.com. A working journalist for 25 years, he covers the Champions League, European soccer and the world game. Follow him on Twitter. Manchester City saw their hopes in the Champions League all but extinguished Tuesday night after a 2-2 draw against Dutch champions Ajax left their fate out of their hands. The game was marred by two contentious refereeing decisions that had City fuming at the whistle, but that will not change an essential fact: Roberto Mancini and his men simply have not deserved their place in Europe this season. It was always going to be a tough road for the new English champions, who were drawn into one of the toughest “groups of death” in recent memory. Comprised entirely of past European Cup winners — save, of course, Manchester City — even the most faded side of the bunch couldn’t be taken lightly. That team is Ajax, currently fifth in what most agree is a second-tier, selling league. So what? They have now collected four points off the English champions and reminded everyone that Dutch soccer’s not as dead as you might believe. Ajax fielded eight players from their illustrious academy – City fielded none – and dominated this home-and-away series. Ajax racked up five goals in two games on a team that has only conceded nine goals in their first ten games of league play. In fact, City have conceded as many goals in their four European games as they have in all their Premier League encounters. They did it with a squad that combined costs less than an average City’s player’s yearly wage. They did in the face of some big-name, big-pedigree talent. And in doing so, they have exposed City for what it is: hollow. City, like Chelsea, like Paris Saint-Germain and yes, like Real Madrid, have tried to buy their way into titles. They have succeeded in taking three pieces of silverware in a short amount of time – one of those, the Community Shield, really doesn’t count for much. Though feat deserves credit, City have not been able to gain any sort of steel for the competition that truly measures a club’s success – and this deserves derision. A lot must and will be heaped on Roberto Mancini’s shoulders. He has demonstrated an alarming fecklessness during his tenure as City’s manager and seems more concerned with career-climbing than with developing an actual team. His body language Tuesday night was suggestive. When Siem de Jong rattled his first goal home, Mancini’s face was dismissive of his own team, a deflective gesture that was utterly self-serving. This is a manager who seems unable to stop self-aggrandizing, inexplicably telling reporters last week that “seven or eight” clubs were inquiring about his services after the Guardian revealed he had held high level talks with a second-division French team. He seems unable to manage the powerful egos in his squad, enduring a series of frustrations and humiliations nearly every time he makes a substitution. Most damning, however, is that he keeps employing systems that do not suit the players he has on the payroll, with the result that teams with continental experience are able to outwit and then outlast his side time and time again. Both goals scored by Ajax were painful: schoolboy errors converted smartly that revealed a lack of preparation and concentration. City’s defenders seemed unable to focus on the pace or intensity of the game, with Gareth Barry particularly victimized. As they did in Amsterdam, City seemed to take a positive result for granted. As they do so often in England, City seemed to think that they could get out of any hole they had dug. But Europe is not England, Ajax are not Stoke or Norwich, and with all due respect to fans of the Premier League, there is far more at stake in the European Cup. That attitude comes from the top, and it is telling that Mancini has always been a flop on the European stage. As a player, the best he could muster was a Cup Winner’s Cup and a bronze medal at a World Cup his nation hosted. As a manager, he’s conquered two leagues but has always fallen badly when he has to play teams outside the borders. His answers at Lazio, at Inter and now at City are eerily familiar: go buy more players. That’s a manger’s way of saying it’s not his fault, but the truth is, a fine craftsman doesn’t blame his tools. Mancini’s no craftsman. Just look at Manchester City, stocked with talent, aching for leadership, and wonder what a coach with true European caliber could accomplish.",Raw Data
469,"﻿Matt Hughes has a new role, and the UFC is set to release a code of conduct for fighters. Both were announced in conjunction with Hughes’ retirement by UFC president Dana White at the UFC on FOX 6 news conference Thursday — not that either should be unfamiliar. “It’s nothing new,” Hughes said of the code of conduct. “It’s basically common sense.” Hughes, 39, spent much of his decade-long UFC career dominating the welterweight division. He finally relented to White’s pleas to retire and serve as the UFC’s first VP of athlete development and government relations. The two had discussed the new role since Hughes’ last fight in September 2011. “He basically told me that ‘You are going to retire,’ ” Hughes told FOXSports.com. “He said, ‘We don’t know what you’re going to do, but you’re going to do something.’ ” One of Hughes’ duties will be making sure the UFC’s 400-plus fighters under contract understand the code, which runs about four pages and will be released within a week. “We can write documents all day long, but you can’t talk to a document or seek advice from a document,” UFC COO Lawrence Epstein told FOXSports.com. “Having a guy like Matt — who has gone through just about everything in the Octagon — will allow fighters to seek help from somebody who has been there before.” Donald Cerrone, who faces Anthony Pettis on Saturday, certainly seems to agree. “His voice matters,” he said. Epstein said the code will go out to the fighters via email, and it also will be part of all new UFC contracts. The document will cover criminal behavior and interactions through social media — among other issues. The code will not include language regarding steroids or other banned substances, Epstein said. “Performance-enhancing drugs will not specifically be addressed,” Epstein said. “It’s already policy to avoid doing anything that will hurt the reputation of the UFC. A positive drug test would certainly do that.” There doesn’t appear to be one event that caused UFC officials to create the code, although White did mention that recent fighter Twitter messages have been a concern. “What some people find funny can be horribly offensive to others,” White said. “Comedians can say anything. (UFC fighters) are not comedians. That’s the biggest problem with our athletes.” Hughes didn’t have to worry about Facebook or Twitter when he began his UFC career. Neither existed yet. His debut fight in the then-sputtering MMA promotion was in September 1999, two years before White persuaded the Fertitta brothers to purchase UFC. “He’s been a loyal guy to us,” White said. “As we were building this company, it was like the wild, wild west. There were always a few guys I could count on, and Matt Hughes was one of those guys.” Hughes, a two-time All-American wrestler at Eastern Illinois University, had two stints as UFC welterweight champion, spanning five years total. He lost the belt the second time to current titleholder Georges St-Pierre in November 2006. Hughes exits UFC — at least as a fighter — with the most wins (18), as a UFC Hall of Famer and as a two-time coach on “The Ultimate Fighter.”",Raw Data

More than a generation later, the 58-year-old Eruzione is parting with his iconic No. 21 USA jersey, hockey stick and other Olympic paraphernalia. Dallas-based Heritage Auctions is selling the items in New York on Feb. 23, the day after the 33rd anniversary of the historic game. ''It was back when the Americans were all amateurs and playing against a professional Soviet team that was supposedly unbeatable. It was the Cold War. ... The Americans were big underdogs. It was a worldwide event that was incredible,'' Castinetti said. The auction record for any piece of hockey memorabilia is $1.2 million, set in 2010 for the jersey Paul Henderson wore when he scored the winning goal in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviets. Unlike Olympians of today, Eruzione, who was captain of his team in Lake Placid, N.Y., received no lucrative endorsements. But he said he's not hurting financially and is selling the prized items to help out his three adult children and grandson. ''I thought this would be a great little nest egg for them for their future with their kids,'' he said in a telephone interview, adding the memorabilia had languished in his USA hockey bag in the attic of his Winthrop, Mass., home, ever since that memorable day. Eruzione said the auction proceeds from his collection will also benefit his Winthrop Foundation founded in his hometown, just outside Boston. The team beat the Soviets 4-3 after Eruzione scored what would be the winning goal with 10 minutes left in the semifinal game. Two days later, the team clinched the gold when it beat Finland. The Soviets won the silver medal. ''As long as I'm alive, the gold medal won't be sold,'' said Eruzione, who is director of special outreach at Boston University and a partner in a nutritional supplement business that includes several other ex-Olympians, including gymnasts Nadia Comaneci and Bart Conner. ''The medal is what it's all about,'' Eruzione said. ''That's what we played for.'' But the sale does include ''Miracle On Ice'' forward Steve Christoff's gold medal, estimated to bring $400,000. He was the first player from the ''Miracle On Ice'' team to be drafted and go to the NHL, playing for the Minnesota North Stars and the Los Angeles Kings. It's estimated that Eruzione's hockey stick will sell for $50,000. In addition, he is selling the blue jersey he wore when he won the gold, estimated at $200,000, and the glove and warm-up suit he wore to the podium when he accepted the gold, both estimated to bring $10,000. ''Unlike any other sports collectible, I can see Eruzione's collection and Christoff's gold medal finding their way into people's home who are not necessarily sports fans, because this was patriotic. They made movies and documentaries about this,'' said Howie Schwartz, CEO of Grandstand Sports in New York City, a sports and entertainment memorabilia venture that has had exclusive deals with the ''Miracle On Ice'' team over the years for autographed merchandise and appearances. ''It was the biggest upset in sports history,'' he said. ''In my eyes, Eruzione's collection is a seven-figure sale, as is Christoff's gold medal.'' Eruzione said he hopes whoever buys his pieces will appreciate them as much as he has. ''It was a special, proud moment,'' he said. ''It was not just a great moment for me and my teammates, but a great moment for the United States.''",Raw Data

""We're letting everybody know the ‘Bank of Cuban' is open,"" team owner Mark Cuban said Monday. ""And if it's the right deal, we don't mind taking back money. But we're not going to do a trade just to do a trade. It's got to be worthwhile."" Meanwhile Monday, Cuban's team once again performed as if fortified by the ""buyers'' approach, recording a third straight victory with a comfortable 113-98 decision over the visiting Timberwolves at American Airlines Center. A trio of first-year Mavs, Darren Collison (23 points), OJ Mayo (20 points, seven rebounds and nine assists) and Elton Brand (a season-best 20 points) fueled the win that was highlighted by a season-high 32 assists. The Mavs rushed to a 19-5 edge and built a lead that bloated to 23 points in the second half, easing Dallas to a record of 16-23 — a humble mark for a team with a decade-plus-long history of winning 50-plus but enough of a turnaround to push the Mavs to within five games of the eighth spot in the West standings. The Mavs hadn't won three straight since early December. ""We've just got to continue playing well and understand the season is a marathon,'' Mayo said. While the players on the floor continue to try to turn the club in the right direction, Cuban's front office is attempting to play its part. Over the weekend, Cuban said there was a ""100-percent chance"" the Mavericks would try to make a trade. At the same time, the owner crushed the foolish rumors of a trade-away of Dirk Nowitzki. ""Every day, I'm going through rosters, trying to come up with ideas for Donnie,"" Cuban said. So the Bank of Cuban is open.

475,"The U.S. Open is returning to Winged Foot, the New York club with a history of clutch moments and one unforgettable collapse. Catch up on the latest in golf with FOXSports.com. The U.S. Golf Association will announce Monday that the West Course at Winged Foot will host the 2020 U.S. Open, the sixth time the club has hosted the tournament. Only two other courses — Oakmont and Baltusrol — will have held the national championship more times. ''Winged Foot offers a spectacular setting in a dynamic market, and has justifiably earned its reputation as one of the premier U.S. Open venues in the nation,'' said Thomas O'Toole Jr., vice president of the USGA and head of its championship committee. ''And it joins an impressive lineup of future U.S. Open Championship locations that players and fans alike can eagerly anticipate.'' Winged Foot was designed by A.W. Tillinghast in 1923 and hosted its first U.S. Open six years later, when amateur Bobby Jones delivered one of the biggest shots in championship history with a 12-foot putt on the final hole to force a 36-hole playoff. He won the next day by 23 shots over Al Espinosa. The most recent trip to Winged Foot was memorable for all the wrong reasons - not for Geoff Ogilvy winning with a superb up-and-down from below the 18th green, but for Phil Mickelson blowing his best chance ever to win the U.S. Open. Mickelson had a one-shot lead when his drive bounced off corporate tents to the left of the 18th fairway. He went for the green and his 3-iron struck a tree and dropped straight down, his next shot plugged in a bunker and he make double bogey to lose by one. ''I am such an idiot,'' he famously said that day. Mickelson referenced that moment just five days ago when discussing his mistake to go public with being unhappy about how much he days in taxes. Winged Foot also is where former USGA President Sandy Tatum offered the defining comment for the U.S. Open. ''Our intention is not to embarrass the greatest players in the world, but to identify them,'' he said in 1974, when Hale Irwin won at 7-over 287. Billy Casper won his first U.S. Open at Winged Foot in 1959. Fuzzy Zoeller won in 1984 in a playoff over Greg Norman, who holed a long putt across the 18th green for par. Zoeller, thinking the Shark had made birdie, jokingly waved a white towel. It only got Norman into a Monday playoff, and the next day, Zoeller won so handily that Norman waved a white towel walking up the final fairway. Winged Foot doesn't have a history of dull moments. The Westchester course is known for the severe slopes on the greens and deep bunkers and doglegs along the tree-lined fairways. USGA executive director Mike Davis was in charge of setting up the Open for the first time at Winged Foot in 2006. He referred to Winged Foot as a ''quintessential U.S. Open golf course.'' For some golfers, the biggest prizes aren't their tournament wins but their wives and girlfriends. ''Winged Foot offers the best players in the world a spectacular test of golf and delivers to spirited New York golf fans one of the most exciting venues in the game,'' he said. The U.S. Open returns this year to Merion, and then will go to Pinehurst No. 2 (2014), Chambers Bay (2015), Oakmont (2016), Erin Hills (2017), Shinnecock Hills (2018), Pebble Beach (2019) and then Winged Foot. ''I think it's great,'' Ogilvy said about the return to Winged Foot. ''I'm excited for the club. It's one of the best clubs in America for that sort of thing. It's a true golf club in the original sense. They love playing golf. The courses are super busy. You meet Winged Foot members everywhere and they can't say enough about it. And it's got such a great history, really.''",Raw Data

Our fans should always remember Tayshaun as a winner and what I would call a pro’s pro. If you don’t like Tayshaun Prince’s game, you don’t like basketball. He’s such a great all-around player.

Big moments are the moments he most enjoys. I heard Lawrence Frank the other night say two things you always have to consider about players are availability and reliability. I couldn’t agree more. Short of a serious injury, Tayshaun is going to play. He plays with great effort and intelligence. He knows he’s got great length and he uses it. He seems to have a great understanding of the game, such a great feel for basketball. He plays makes that sometimes you don’t think are available to be made. You’ve got to love him on either end of the alley oop – that says something right there.

We all will forever remember the block on Reggie Miller in the championship season. It’s not just that he can run down guys and block shots – he is an excellent defender. There are guys who have been known just for defense that aren’t any better defenders than Tayshaun Prince, but he’s a guy who can play the entire game and the entire floor. The first thing I really noticed about Tayshaun was that he would fill up a stat sheet. He’d fill it up in different ways on different days. If you needed rebounds, he’d have ’em. If you needed assists, he’s have ’em. His scoring was there when it was needed and clearly there were going to be steals and blocked shots – just don’t expect many numbers in the turnovers column. The question was raised a long time ago and it’s been answered a hundredfold since: Is he too thin to play in the NBA? But I saw him play against a very good Michigan State team in the Breslin Center one year when I was broadcasting both the Spartans and the Pistons and you know how physical Tom Izzo’s teams play. Tayshaun was every bit strong enough to play there and he’s proven he’s every bit strong enough to play at this level. He’s wiry strong and mentally very tough. In all my 36 years as the voice of the Pistons, I’d have to say he’s one of my favorite guys to be around, too. He may, at times, be a man of few words, but he’s a very genuine person, a very intelligent person and a very friendly guy. He’s the kind of guy you want on your team. If anybody wondered why Joe Dumars signed him to a four-year contract, my question would be, “Wouldn’t you be shocked if he didn’t want to keep him?” The only question was if Tayshaun wanted to go somewhere else and chase an immediate championship. Heck, the way the Pistons are playing now, he could have another chance here before his contract is up. He’s a guy you want around. I thought he was our best player last year, he might be our best player this year and not signing him would have been the mistake. It’s amazing when you think of how many games Tayshaun has played in and how many more he could potentially play in. There are only five names ahead of him – Joe D, Isiah, Bill Laimbeer and Mr. 007 himself, Vinnie Johnson, plus Lindsey Hunter, and Tayshaun will pass Lindsey on this road trip. Lindsey’s an NBA champion and there will be only NBA champions in front of him on the Pistons’ all-time games played list. The bottom line is Tayshaun Prince is a champion.",Raw Data
479,"Angel Reyna scored a genuinely superb goal for Pachuca against Cruz Azul in Mexico - but then capped it with a celebration that was even better. After just three minutes of the Mexican Liga MX clash, Reyna smashed in a simply wonderful 40-yard half-volley that screamed into the top corner of the net. The striker, on loan from Monterrey, then teamed up with team-mate Dario Carreno for a celebration that more resembled something you would see in a WWE ring as opposed to a football pitch.

Follow him on Twitter or like him on Facebook. Two teams this NBA season have shaken off last year's struggles, fully embraced the tenets of their now Coach of the Year candidate head coaches and turned a history of dysfunction into a state of basketball bliss. The New York Knicks are the sexier version of the two — the high-octane scoring machine with an MVP-worthy superstar and a stage bathed in the bright lights of New York City. All of that and their Eastern Conference-best 18-6 record has helped the Knicks drown out almost every other storyline in the NBA outside of the Los Angeles Lakers’ never-ending melodrama. Will LeBron win another one of these? Here's our top 10 MVP candidates. But it's the Golden State Warriors — quietly on a quest to carve a dangerous reputation in a brutally difficult Western Conference — who might be the version of the two built to last, weather an 82-game season’s up and downs and grind out the very different reality of playoff basketball. Sexy? No. They most certainly are not. They play in Oakland, they haven't boasted an All-Star since 1997 (a league-worst stretch), they have a team that at 23-43 last season wasn’t so much reviled as invisible, and they’re just fifth in the Western Conference behind title-contending teams such as Oklahoma City, San Antonio, Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers. But unlike the much-hyped and attention-worthy Knicks, Golden State has built its resurgence on rebounding and a marked defensive improvement. The Knicks have blossomed post-Mike D’Antoni with remarkable 3-point shooting that almost certainly will come back to earth but, D’Antoni-esqe, it’s come at the cost of defense. And it’s defense rather than 3-point shooting that a team can rely on when the buckets stop falling from 23-plus feet. The Knicks are shooting 40.5 percent from the 3-point line this season, a pace that, if they kept it up all season, would make them one of fewer than a dozen teams to surpass the 40 percent mark in NBA history. Golden State, on the other hand, has built its resurgence on defense and rebounding. While the NBA world watches all things Knicks and Lakers — not even the Miami Heat (defending champions), Oklahoma City Thunder (11-game winning streak) or Los Angeles Clippers (10-game winning streak) seem able to force their way to forefront of the primary NBA coverage — Golden State has obscurely marked itself as a serious contender. The Warriors have won seven of their last eight and 12 of their last 15. They just got back from a grueling road trip during which they won six of seven, including against Miami, Brooklyn and Atlanta. It’s a feat largely obscured by the hyper focus on the Knicks and Lakers and the Thunder and Clippers winning streaks. At 17-8, these guys are the biggest — and most impressive — surprise in the NBA. Look at it this way: Carmelo Anthony makes $19.45 million this season. The Warriors' entire current starting lineup makes less -- about $22.7 million this season. This is no way an attack on the New York Knicks. They are an incredible basketball team, powered by a superstar (Carmelo Anthony) who has become a serious MVP candidate now that he’s surrounded by a team honed to his liking, and led by a head coach (Mike Woodson) who has proved his worth. They play in a much easier conference, meaning there are fewer stumbling blocks once the playoffs begin, and they have the second-best offense in the league. Their chance of making the Finals are strong. But they’re also defensively suspect, at least for now, and awful on the offensive boards. The Knicks have seen their defensive rating — the points allowed per 100 possessions — regress from being fifth in the league last season to 18th this season. And while their defensive-rebounding percentage puts them at sixth-best team in the NBA, they’re an abysmal 26th in offensive-rebounding percentage. Golden State, by contrast, has basically the same offense as last season but they’ve gone from having the 27th-ranked defensive rating last season to 12th this year. They also have the best defensive-rebounding percentage in the NBA and the 12-best offensive percentage in the league. They play defense. They have two leaders in Stephen Curry and David Lee who are having All-Star seasons. They are 16-1 when they outrebound the opposing team. They have a coach who has made them a consistent, dangerous threat on both ends of the floor. Monta Ellis and his need to shoot are gone, and young guys like Harrison Barnes, Klay Thompson and Festus Ezeli are stepping up after a season-ending injury to Brandon Rush and an injury to Andrew Bogut that still has him sidelined. Ball movement. Defense. Rebounding. Consistency. An ability to win on the road against tough competition. A coming together in the face of two stars being seriously felled by injury. Utter confidence. This is who Golden State is. “We have a confidence,” Curry said. “We feel like we can win every game we play no matter who the competition is. And when you win on the road it just enhances the confidence we have. Our job now is to not get complacent, to stay hungry, to stay committed, to outwork other teams and stay that scrappy team that’s gotten us where we are. We have to keep that aggression.” Wednesday night’s game was the perfect microcosm for this Warriors team. David Lee’s 26 points and nine rebounds came on the heels of a streak of seven straight road games in which he had least 20 points and 10 rebounds — something only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had done previously. Curry had 13 points on only 5-of-13 shooting but impacted the game in ways that don’t show up on a box score, and Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry each came off the bench in a big way with 16 points each. Jack tacked on 10 assists for his first double-double of the year, and Landry had nine rebounds. All of which is why, against a tough New Orleans team that plays everyone hard, the Warriors hung in there, played defense and won down the stretch — something they couldn’t do last year. After the game, Reggie Miller texted head coach Mark Jackson congratulations for not just the win but having a team that could return from such a grueling, successful road trip and play New Orleans with an intensity reserved for teams hungry to be great night in and night out. Jackson should be one of the celebrated men of the NBA now. He’s taken a hapless organization — using, there is not doubt, a perfectly pieced together roster compliments of general manager Bob Myers — and convinced them that defense, ball movement and a collective approach can win games. In a place where that hasn’t really happened much in a long time. With a group of very young guys — four starters 24 or younger — who you might expect not mature enough to learn, let alone embrace, that lesson. Looking for the latest on the Warriors? Get the inside slant, stats, scores, schedules and more scoops right here. “These guys are naturally unselfish basketball players,” Jackson said. “They care for one another, they look out for one another and they look to make plays for one another.” The New York Knicks might be the juicier story with the easier road and the best shot at winning it all. But Golden State is built the way an under-the-radar success story tends to be in the NBA: Based on defense, chemistry, rebounding and a surprising tendency to win when no one’s really looking.",Raw Data

His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. The obvious NFL storyline is a remake: the potential for a Harbaugh vs. Harbaugh clash in the Super Bowl. We beat this story to death a year ago until the Giants sent Jim Harbaugh and the 49ers home with a field goal in overtime and a dropped pass plus shanked field goal cost John Harbaugh and the Ravens a trip to the Super Bowl. Here we are again — the Ravens and 49ers both a victory away from pitting coaching brothers in sports’ biggest contest. But there’s a twist. Harbaugh vs. Harbaugh isn’t the right narrative this time. Jim Harbaugh vs. Bill Belichick is the more significant story. That’s the Super Bowl we should all want to see. Jim vs. Bill would be bigger than last weekend’s Peyton vs. Ray clash. In fact, I find Jim vs. Bill more interesting than Tom vs. Peyton. To me, where football is at right now, with the games controlled from the sidelines by coaches speaking directly into the helmets of quarterbacks and middle linebackers, Jim vs. Bill might as well be Ali vs. Frazier, Magic vs. Bird and Kardashian ass vs. spandex rolled into one colossal showdown. Let me explain what we witnessed during the divisional playoffs. Two coaching forces of nature — Jim Harbaugh and Bill Belichick — further distanced themselves from their peers. It is not a coincidence or byproduct of favorable matchups that the 49ers and Patriots had it easy getting past the Packers and Texans, respectively, while John Harbaugh’s Ravens and Mike Smith’s Falcons escaped exciting, but embarrassingly sloppy, contests that featured coaching and strategic nightmares on all four sidelines. Eight coaches showed up over the weekend. Four — John Harbaugh, Mike Smith, Pete Carroll and John Fox — made fools of themselves. And two — Mike McCarthy and Gary Kubiak — were overwhelmed by Jim Harbaugh and Bill Belichick. Seriously, the Ravens survived what I believe to be the worst playoff coaching performance in history. Credible people are actually suggesting Baltimore offensive coordinator and former Colts coach Jim Caldwell should be a head-coaching candidate because of the 38 points the Ravens scored in 76 minutes. I watched a totally different game. I watched the game in which Caldwell abandoned wide receiver Torrey Smith in the second half and ran Ray Rice on first and second down on nearly every possession, putting QB Joe Flacco under enormous third-down pressure. Baltimore sustained absolutely nothing on offense. It was all big plays or points off turnovers. Who bailed out Harbaugh and Caldwell? John Fox News, whose late-game decision-making was so conservative and risk averse that Roger Ailes allegedly plans to meet with him about running for president in 2016. JFN had Peyton Manning take a knee with two timeouts and 30 seconds on the clock at the end of regulation. Not to be outdone, Pete Carroll auditioned for a late-night spot on MSNBC. Has a coach ever liberally given away more playoff points than Carroll? His timeout before the game-deciding field goal was a non-factor. The field goals he didn’t take and boneheaded clock management in the first half decided Seattle’s fate. Carroll’s foolishness allowed Smith to avoid discussing his own strategic stupidity. Had Seattle hung on for the victory, Smith would’ve had to explain what the greatest tight end in history, Tony Gonzalez, was doing blocking on third-and-7 on Atlanta’s second-to-last possession. Gonzalez was invented for third-and-7. He caught everything close to him on Sunday, including the pass that set up the game-winning field goal. Seattle’s pass rush wasn’t a factor on Sunday. Why was Tony blocking on third-and-7? And shall I mention Atlanta’s squib kick after the game-winning field goal, or why Smith called a timeout with 13 seconds on the clock before the field goal? Why leave 13 seconds on the clock and time for two Seattle pass plays? It was a coaching disaster over the weekend. Only two coaches — Belichick and Jim Harbaugh — were left unscathed. Belichick has long stood out, but his reputation has yet to fully recover from the Spygate controversy that taints his three Super Bowl titles. He needs to add a fourth to re-stamp his name alongside Vince Lombardi as professional football’s coaching gold standard. Harbaugh is the new and possibly improved Belichick. Better looking, more colorful, brash, filled with collegiate energy and emotion and a former NFL player, Harbaugh is a natural — a coaching tsunami like we’ve never seen. Except he does remind me of Belichick in one respect. If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: Belichick made his bones by making a bold move at quarterback thanks to an injury. You know the story. Belichick stuck with Tom Brady, a sixth-round pick, over his $100 million QB Drew Bledsoe back in 2001 and won a Super Bowl. Harbaugh is attempting to do the exact same thing, only his move to Colin Kaepernick over Alex Smith is more audacious than Belichick’s move to Brady. Bledsoe’s injury caused him to sit for two months. Belichick had plenty of time to evaluate Brady, who didn’t throw an interception in four consecutive games. I’m not saying it was an easy choice, but Harbaugh’s was much more difficult. In Alex Smith’s previous full game, he completed 18-of-19 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns. His lone incompletion was a drop. He suffered a concussion in San Fran’s following game against the Rams. He completed 7-of-8 passes for one score before getting hurt. Smith lost his job while he was leading the league in passer rating and had completed 25 of his last 27 throws for four scores. He missed one game with a concussion. Jim Harbaugh is ruthless (in a good way) and bold in a way we could never imagine previously. If the 49ers win this weekend in Atlanta with Kaepernick playing anything like the way he did against the Packers, Harbaugh’s impact on the NFL will reverberate for the next decade. The unwritten rule about not losing a job to injury will be rewritten in permanent ink to reflect that a player can lose his job for sneezing at the wrong time or any other reason a coach chooses. More seriously, no one will look at a QB controversy as a negative again. If you have the right coach, with a proper command of his locker room, there is no such thing as a QB controversy. There is just QB change. Nearly every team will be shopping in the draft for a Colin Kaepernick to put pressure on the starting QB. I’m not talking about teams looking for QBs who can run the read option. I’m talking about teams being on a constant search to improve at the QB position the same way teams constantly try to improve their offensive lines. The Texans, Cowboys, Bears, Lions, Bengals and Chargers — all teams with good QBs — should look for their Kaepernick in this year’s draft. Why not? Belichick started all this when he got lucky and fell into Brady late in the 2000 NFL Draft. A decade later, Harbaugh took it to a new level when he hunted down Kaepernick in the second round of the 2011 draft and forced him into the lineup as soon as an opportunity presented itself. Belichick and Harbaugh are game-changers. Belichick vs. Harbaugh is the Super Bowl matchup I want to see. Jim Harbaugh vs. John Harbaugh is last year’s story.",Raw Data
484,"To find an answer, perhaps it’s better to begin with what the 28-year-old natural — who won the PGA Tour season opener, the Hyundai Tournament of Champions on Tuesday — is, rather than what he’s not. Johnson can dunk a basketball in bare feet, throw an impressively tight football spiral, hurl a 90 mph four-seamer and, in high school, scored goals for fun in soccer. ""Dustin's standing broad jump puts him in the 93rd percentile among NBA players,” his trainer, Randy Myers, told Sports Illustrated in 2011. “His time in the three-cone drill (measuring speed and agility) puts him in the 80th percentile among NFL skill-position players. “I've been doing this for 23 years, and he's the best athlete I've ever seen.” Those who knew the 6-foot-4, 205-pound prodigy in South Carolina say he could have gotten Division I scholarships in several different sports but chose the one that came most naturally: golf. And maybe that was because it also was the one that came most easily. Two years ago, I played a round of golf with one of Johnson’s former college teammates at Coastal Carolina whose first recollection of the school’s most famous golfing alumnus was that he never practiced. “I mean, never. He’d just show up at tournaments and shoot 64,” he said. It’s no secret that swing coach Butch Harmon was mortified when he began coaching Johnson and realized how little he worked on his game. Harmon would tell the eternally laid-back Johnson that he needed to stop relying on natural talent alone if he wanted to reach No. 1. He’d tell him stories of how hard Tiger Woods worked. But Johnson felt more of a kinship with Phil Mickelson, another prodigious natural talent not known for beating balls on the range. (Harmon also told Johnson he needed to eliminate what he called “extracurricular activities” during tournament weeks, though on that score, Johnson spent the past week in Maui with Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina.) Those around him say that since Johnson moved to Florida and away from the Myrtle Beach area — where as a teenager he mingled with a less-than-desirable crowd — he has become more dedicated to golf. He’ll never be Vijay Singh, who practiced even on Christmas morning, but he’s learning the value of honing his craft. Maybe he finally has realized what everyone already knew? But I can’t help thinking that what’s holding back Johnson isn’t just a better work ethic. He has another flaw. Despite a quirky lead wrist position and a shut clubface that requires some serious compensation on the downswing, Johnson is as long and as straight as they get. He also has remarkably soft hands for a power player, and — under Harmon’s tutelage — has grown into a very sharp wedge player, helping to capitalize on those long drives. And he can roll the rock. Physically, I have no doubt that he’s the real deal. But it’s what lies in the six inches between his ears that’s lets him down in the past. The machine-gun-fast 82 with the lead in the final round of the 2010 US Open; infamously hitting from an (ill-defined) bunker on the 72nd hole of that year’s PGA Championship; the shanked iron out-of-bounds on the back nine at the 2011 British Open. These are all symptomatic of a greater issue. The man has no clue when it comes to course management. And so it was on Tuesday at Kapalua when Johnson took driver on the uncomfortable 13th of the Plantation course, where a long iron and a short iron and a safe par would have been prudent. His drive sailed into the junk, and even though his ball was eventually found, it took Johnson two hacks to get back to civilization. After a double bogey, his lead — which had been as high as five shots — was down to one. “Walking off 13,” Johnson would later recall, “I was like, ‘Oh no, here it goes again.’ ” But if he felt apprehension, he didn’t show it; he never does. Johnson “piped” — Steve Stricker’s word — his driver on the next, then chipped in from 50 feet for an eagle. Even Stricker, his adversary, tried to spell out for Johnson the way the game’s meant to be played at this level with the lead, down the stretch. “He's an impressive player, has a lot of talent, hits the ball a mile,” Stricker said. “But as I was talking to him out there, I was like, 'Dude, what are you doing?' He took out driver on a couple holes and he let me back in the game. “Why don't you take an iron out, make me have to make birdies instead of you hitting it in the trees and opening it up for me? And he's like, 'Yeah, yeah, I know.' "" On this day, it all worked out for Johnson. But he has to know that there will be other days.",Raw Data
485,"The ticket is for Row 1, Section B, Seat 7 of the Lower Grand Stand at Griffith Stadium. Game 7 of the 1924 World Series. The perforations are still intact - it was never torn in two by a ticket-taker. It's the only one of its kind known to still exist. It had been sitting for decades in one of 32 scrapbooks created by the wife of Walter Johnson, the Hall of Fame icon who on Oct. 10, 1924, was the winning pitcher for the Washington Senators in a 12-inning classic against the New York Giants. The victory gave the nation's capital its only World Series title to date. ''My theory is that the ticket was hers and she walked in with him. Who's going to ask her for her ticket? She's Walter Johnson's wife,'' said Hank Thomas, Johnson's grandson. ''She just walked into the stadium and never had to use her ticket. She brought it back and put it in the scrapbook.'' The ticket is one of several gems from Johnson's career up for bids Saturday at Heritage Auctions in New York. Other items include the personalized framed copy of Johnson's plaque from his Hall of Fame induction, a handwritten congratulatory letter from Ty Cobb, the ''Notice to Player of Release or Transfer'' signed by Senators owner Clark Griffith after Johnson's final season in 1927, and an engraved six-piece tea set celebrating the 20th anniversary of Johnson's signing with the team. Johnson's daughter, Carolyn Thomas, who just turned 90, has been the keeper of the memorabilia. She and her son, Hank Thomas, said it was simply time to start parting with it. ''It's always just been around,'' Hank Thomas said. ''And the few times you'd haul it out of the closet and look at it, mostly just to show somebody else, I always enjoyed it. I loved having this stuff, but I'm going to enjoy seeing these guys - because it's a live auction - the guys that win it are going to be so thrilled. There are some real Walter fans out there. It's going to take some money, but they're going to win it and they're going to be so happy. ''So let's get the stuff out of the closet, let's get some money that we can use from it, and let's turn it over to the next generation of collectors. We're all temporary custodians of this stuff.'' That said, there are certain items that will remain in the family because they are just too special to sell. Hank Thomas has the first postcard his grandfather sent to his grandmother when they were dating, signed ''Walter J.'' There are also items that will stay because they are part of the decor in Carolyn Thomas' house, including a foot-high bronze statue of Johnson and a collage of photos of Johnson in poses with Cobb, Griffith and Christy Mathewson. There's another one with Johnson, Babe Ruth and Douglas Fairbanks together on the set of 1924 movie ''The Thief of Bagdad'' - a priceless convergence of entertainment and sports. And there's one with Carolyn Thomas and her father taken in 1924. She's in a frilly bonnet sitting on an oversized glove. He's in his 1924 Washington uniform with the straight, classic ''W'' on both the sleeve and the hat. ''I spent a lot of time at the ballpark,'' Carolyn Thomas said. ''I grew up there and used to hang out in the office all the time. I remember Joe Cronin courting Mildred Robertson (Griffith's niece, later Cronin's wife). They used to flirt in the office there while we were hanging around. I was very comfortable in the ballpark.'' Carolyn Thomas was only 4 when her father retired, so she remembers Johnson less as a player and more as a manager and later a farmer - and as a hero to the city. She said one of her most vivid memories was ''being impatient about getting into the stadium because everybody wanted his autograph, and he never turned anybody away.''",Raw Data

487,"Stephen Curry took some good-natured ribbing from his Golden State teammates following an impromptu celebration near the bench late in fourth quarter against Los Angeles. Few teams have caused more problems this season for the Pacific Division leaders than the Warriors, and Curry has been a major reason why. Curry made four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and Golden State rallied from seven points down in the final 11 minutes to beat the Clippers 106-99 on Monday. ''When you start to talk about elite point guards in this league ... as far as shooting the long ball, Stef is by far the best at his position,'' said Jarrett Jack, who had 18 points and 10 assists off the bench for the Warriors. ''Playing with him on a regular basis I've got a better appreciation for him. When he's able to get hot like he did, it serves our offense that much more.'' Curry finished with 28 points and is averaging 23.0 points in four games against the Clippers this season. That's a key to why the Warriors have won three of those games and are the only team to beat Los Angeles more than once this year. ''That means you're beating a good team and you're stepping up for big games,'' said Curry, who went 6 of 8 from beyond the arc. ''To win three out of four and continue playing the good ball that we've been playing, that's just a good sign for us.'' Curry stayed mostly silent for three quarters in his second game back from an ankle injury but gave the Warriors a much-needed spark in the fourth after the Clippers had taken an 82-75 lead. See the NBA's high moments and the low ones. Photos of the week. He scored 16 points, including three 3's in a span of 2:13, fired a bounce pass from midcourt to Jack for a fast-break layup that capped a 10-2 run and made four free throws over the final 23.4 seconds to seal the win in what has quickly become a heated rivalry between these two West Coast teams. Things got chippy just before halftime when the Clippers' DeAndre Jordan was called for a technical foul after shoving David Lee into the lap of a courtside fan after getting fouled by Lee. The two men were quickly separated and Klay Thompson made the free throw for Golden State. Curry further frustrated the Clippers after his 3-pointer in the fourth quarter gave the Warriors an 88-86 lead. Curry raised his arms in the air, pumped his right fist emphatically then galloped down the court. He started dancing after making another 3 later in the quarter. The Clippers took notice. ''That's a young team that's improving, for sure, but we have our sights set on trying to play in June,'' said Los Angeles guard Jamal Crawford. ''I'm not saying they don't. But we're looking at bigger goals than celebrating everything.'' Los Angeles regained its composure long enough to put together a 12-0 run to end the third quarter and was comfortably up in the fourth before Curry rallied the Warriors to end the Clippers' four-game winning streak. There were five lead changes in the fourth quarter, but Los Angeles managed only two baskets over the final 3:40 while Golden State closed on a 14-4 run. See how NBA dance teams get crowds all fired up. Blake Griffin had 26 points and 13 rebounds for the Clippers. Crawford added 24 points off the bench. Chris Paul, playing in his second game after sitting out three with a knee injury, had just four points on 1-of-7 shooting. After the game, Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro said the team would re-evaluate Paul's status before clearing him to play against Oklahoma City on Tuesday. ''You could see he doesn't have that extra burst like he usually has,'' Del Negro said. ''It's nice to have him out there because he settles everything down. It's just that he can't play at the level he's used to with the injury.'' Klay Thompson scored 18 points and Lee had 12 points and 11 rebounds for the Warriors. Golden State (25-15) has won back-to-back games for the first time since the end of December and still trail Los Angeles by six games in the Pacific. The Clippers (32-10) lost for just the second time in nine games. The flurry at the end was in stark contrast to earlier in the game when neither team could establish much control. Griffin's thunderous dunk from just outside the lane gave the Clippers an early lead and Crawford later scored eight consecutive points to make it 33-29. Draymond Green's jumper and two free throws from Jarrett Jack with 0.4 seconds left tied the score. The Warriors scored 10 straight points to open the second and went up 52-42 on Curry's fadeaway jumper with 3:10 remaining before the Clippers put together their best run of the half. Griffin scored on a reverse layup and had two free throws, Butler made a 3-pointer and Paul added two free throws to help pull Los Angeles to 53-52 at the break. Crawford, the former Warrior, got Los Angeles going briefly in the third. After Lee's layup put Golden State up 71-65, Crawford made two 3-pointers and banked a 5-footer off the glass as part of a 15-2 run to close the period. Crawford finished 9 of 18 from the floor and set a season high for 3s (six) while Caron Butler added 19 points and five rebounds for Los Angeles. The Clippers went up 82-75 on a reverse layup by Matt Barnes with 10:49 left but couldn't make the lead hold up. NOTES: Injured Warriors C Andrew Bogut ran full-court sprints before the game, an important step in his rehab from his left. The 7-footer has not played since Nov. 7 and has missed 36 games overall this season. Golden State coach Mark Jackson, however, isn't putting a timetable on Bogut's return. ''We've got to keep it moving and look forward to having him one day, whenever that comes,'' Jackson said. ''I, like Dr. King, have a dream.'' ...

488,"Nevertheless, he's anticipating changes in the way injuries not affecting the head are evaluated on the sideline. Goodell was in Denver for Saturday's Ravens-Broncos playoff game. Griffin had reconstructive ACL surgery Wednesday after reinjuring his right knee in last Sunday's playoff loss to Seattle. He also strained a ligament in the same knee last month against Baltimore. That raised questions about whether Redskins coach Mike Shanahan should have let Griffin in either game after it was clear the quarterback was hurt. Goodell said it was a ''medical decision'' and noted Griffin had no problem with it, either. ''Now, people can argue whether it was the wrong decision, but it was a medical decision and that's what we want it to be,'' Goodell said. ''Will we make further changes? Yeah, I would anticipate we will. We'll always look at that and try to see what else we can do to make sure the proper medical attention is being given, that they make the best medical evaluation and it's their determination to make.'' Asked if independent doctors were needed on the sideline, not those chosen by the team, Goodell insisted the physicians were impartial. ''When you say independent, all these doctors work for other institutions,'' he said. ''And they're well respected and the medical care in the NFL is outstanding. And if they have a concussion, they have to see an independent neurologist before they're cleared to play.'' He noted that Dr. James Andrews is a highly regarded orthopedic surgeon, ''and I think he made a judgment and the team made a judgment, and Robert Griffin seems to be comfortable with it, too. I think as long as they are medical decisions, that is our primary objective.'' Goodell said the league is looking into the poor playing conditions at FedEx Field last week, when not only was RG3 hurt, but the Seahawks lost their best pass rusher, Chris Clemons, to a torn ACL in his left knee. ''We're going to evaluate that,'' Goodell said. ''Interestingly enough, we had no complaints of the field in the Dallas game (the week before). And so what we have to do is think through that a little bit and say what happened between there, and our staff is looking at that to try to determine should a field be required to be re-sodded, even between the hash marks.'' In a meeting with reporters following a fan forum at Sports Authority Field, Goodell also addressed the recent findings that Junior Seau had a degenerative brain disease often linked with repeated blows to the head when he shot himself in the chest last year. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health said Thursday the former NFL star's abnormalities are consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. Goodell said the findings underscore the need for additional research into CTE and he noted that NFL teams have given a $30 million research grant to the NIH and are committed to spending $70 million more on health research, as specified in its collective bargaining agreement with the players. ''It's why we're investing in the research is to find out more about it, CTE, in particular, but also brain injury and brain disease. And we need to have a lot more research because there's still unfortunately a lot of unknowns,'' Goodell said. The hard-hitting linebacker played for 20 seasons with San Diego, Miami and New England before retiring in 2009. He died at age 43 of a self-inflicted gunshot in May, and his family requested the analysis of his brain. Seau joins a list of several dozen football players who were found to have CTE. Boston University's center for study of the disease reported last month that 34 former pro players and nine who played only college football suffered from CTE. The NFL faces lawsuits by thousands of former players who say the league withheld information on the harmful effects of concussions. According to an AP review of 175 lawsuits, 3,818 players have sued. At least 26 Hall of Fame members are among the players who have done so. Goodell noted that his top priority as commissioner is to reduce head trauma in the game. ''We haven't waited for the research. We've been making changes for the game, making rule changes, making equipment changes,'' he said. ''Medicine has a ways to go. We need to fund more research. We have that in our collective bargaining agreement, to have $100 million worth of research. ""We've funded $30 million to the NIH last fall, so that research is under way and I think that will be beneficial in treatment and also in what we can do in continuing to make not just football safer but every other sport.'' On other topics, Goodell said: - He hasn't made a decision on when to reinstate New Orleans Saints coach Sean Peyton, who was suspended last season because of the team's bounty scandal. - He hasn't made up his mind on where he stands on the expansion of the playoffs, but wants to make sure any change in the format wouldn't dilute the importance of the regular-season games.",Raw Data
489,"The 7-footer is more aggressive with 34 points as the Lakers grind out a 101-95 win at New Orleans to open a seven-game trip. Lakers power forward Pau Gasol, who finished with 34 points, drives to the… (Derick E. Hingle / US Presswire ) Reporting from New Orleans The start of a seven-game, 13-day trip for the Lakers proved to be anything but easy, even against an injury-depleted New Orleans Hornets team. It meant the Lakers had to dig down on defense. It meant they had to take care of the basketball. And perhaps more important, it meant leaning on Pau Gasol to deliver. The grind-it-out 101-95 victory over the Hornets on Saturday night at the New Orleans Arena could be a harbinger for the Lakers because of the difficult road they still must travel on this trip. For now, the Lakers will take starting out 1-0, happy that Gasol was the aggressor once again after his talk with Kobe Bryant in which he demanded that the 7-foot forward be a force. Gasol had a season-high 34 points on 13-for-17 shooting. He missed only one of his nine free throws. He also had 10 rebounds, three assists and one blocked shot. ""It's important to win the first one and build on it,"" Gasol said. ""Now the second step is to build on what you started. ""But it's not a guarantee. So we have to understand the next few games are going to be really tough, very challenging, each and every one of them. We've got to play our best."" Bryant wasn't bad himself, with 32 points, nine rebounds and five assists. The last time two Lakers scored 30-plus points in a game was Bryant (49) and Gasol (30) against Phoenix on March 1, 2009. Gasol had 19 points in the first half and 13 in the third quarter. He had only two in the fourth quarter — on two free throws — but that was because the Lakers didn't look for Gasol, who didn't get a field-goal attempt in the quarter. ""I shot the ball well,"" Gasol said. ""I was aggressive. I got a lot of good looks. I was in a very good rhythm tonight."" It was after the Lakers lost to the Boston Celtics last Sunday that Bryant strongly urged Gasol to be more dominant. When Lakers Coach Phil Jackson was told about Bryant's comments, he rolled his eyes. ""Kobe did that?"" Jackson asked incredulously. ""I talk to him [Gasol] every day about being aggressive."" Even though the Hornets were without two starters, center Emeka Okafor (left oblique strain) and small forward Trevor Ariza (sprained right ankle), they didn't roll over. After Lakers had a 56-50 halftime lead, New Orleans shot 65% from the field in the third quarter to take a one-point lead and some home-crowd momentum into the final 12 minutes. Chris Paul had 13 of his 21 points in the third and handed out six of his 15 assists. But in the fourth quarter, the Lakers held the Hornets to 13 points on 27.3% (six-for-22) shooting. The Lakers blocked three shots in the fourth and had two steals. They also had season-low four turnovers, one shy of the franchise low. ""We got the ball stopped in the fourth quarter,"" Jackson said. ""They were breaking through. Paul was getting what he wanted off that cross-over, getting back to the middle off screen-and-rolls. But we started getting the ball stopped in the fourth quarter."" Now it's on to Memphis to face the Grizzlies on Monday. These are the same Grizzlies that have beatenthe Lakers the last two games. Perhaps, the grind-it-out game against the Hornets prepared the Lakers for the rest of the trip. ""I hope so,"" Jackson said. ""That means we'll be in every game [and will have] a chance to win it, that's for sure.""",Raw Data
490,"Not long after the Pistons drafted Andre Drummond, I remember talking to George David, assistant general manager for the Pistons. And I told George that I’d heard what Joe D said about Andre on draft night – that all reports were this was a very bright kid, not just a physically gifted player. George confirmed that to me. He said that over the summer, when they would go over every segment of the game with Andre and then go back and retest him, he’d get almost every answer right the first time. He said that was extremely rare for a rookie and exceptionally rare for somebody who was only 18 years old at the time and is now just 19. Andre is a very bright guy. And if you spend any time around him, you know he wants to do the right thing and he wants to learn. He appears to be extremely coachable. Those are all major pluses for somebody in his situation. Not only that, George told me that their goal for Andre was for him to do what he does best as well as he can and as often as he can and that if he could just do that, he would be a legitimate NBA big man almost immediately. I think we’ve already seen he’s all of that. And that’s kind of understating what this guy has done, because to me, on certain nights, he has been absolutely spectacular. I see Andre Drummond lining up someday as one of the best big men in our league. I don’t think that’s a reach – I don’t think it’s even close to a reach. Andre reminds me, to a certain degree, of a young Dennis Rodman. I remember working with Dick Motta and during a preseason telecast during Dennis’ rookie year, Dick said on the air that this guy is going to be one of the best rebounders in our league. Then, a couple of weeks later, early in the regular season, he said to me – again, on the air – Dennis Rodman is going to be the best rebounder in our league since Bill Russell. When you look at what Dennis was able to accomplish as a rebounder, Dick Motta was right on. The guy I work with these days, Gregory Kelser, raves about Andre’s ability to get after the offensive glass, which was of the things Dennis did so well. Andre is already in my opinion, and the numbers bear it out, an elite offensive rebounder and an elite shot-blocker. He’s not being asked to do a lot of things offensively, but I tell you what: He can play above the rim and deal with lob dunks with anybody in the league. Will Bynum loves being on the court with him, as anybody who’s seen the Pistons play knows. He’s been a major bright spot for this team. The bench has sparked this team in the last couple of weeks – it’s been impossible to deal with for a lot of teams – and one of the reasons is Andre Drummond. The Pistons, I believe, are still going to be in the running for one of the playoff spots – and you can credit Andre for a lot of that. He’s big time. Andre is one of those big men who come along only once in a while. When I look out on the floor some nights, I see somebody whose frame reminds me of a young Bob Lanier. He’s that big and he’s that long. Bob was a Hall of Famer and it’s too early to compare Andre to Bob, but there are certainly some similarities in terms of stature. Bob was very physical, yet he had an unbelievable touch and he was a great competitor and a very cerebral player. Before all is said and done, we’re going to talk about Andre as a cerebral player and as a physical player and we’ve signs of that already. When he’s determined to get a stop, sometimes he’ll play right through somebody and he’s so strong, he can go right through them. Same thing with Bob and also another physical Pistons center with a different style, Bill Laimbeer. You need to know that guy is there and that there are only certain things you can do against a center of that stature. What the Bob Laniers, Bill Laimbeers and Ben Wallaces did inside was intimidate, to a certain degree, the other guy’s big men. Pistons fans are eager to see Andre and Greg Monroe playing side by side and we know that’s the future. I know one thing: Both are really good people and both want to do what’s best for the team. I don’t think you’ll have a clash of egos at all when these two are on the floor. What we know about Greg Monroe is he’s a fundamentally sound, intelligent basketball player, and what we know about Andre Drummond is he has great physical ability and is a very bright young man still learning the NBA game. They will find a way to co-exist with Greg’s ability to play away from the basket and pass the ball, along with his scoring and rebounding skills. I think they could be a great set of big men. I don’t think too many teams will have a pair of guys on the court like those two and we’ve seen it in the few minutes they’ve been able to play together so far this season. It’s already taking shape and I think they’ll do very well together. It should be a fun decade or more ahead of Pistons basketball watching these two young big men grow up together.

He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. The Pirates have finished with a losing record 20 years in a row. It is the longest slog of ineptitude in major U.S. professional sports. Bill Clinton had not yet been elected president when the Pirates concluded their most recent winning season on Oct. 14, 1992. And that anniversary — a walk-off defeat in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series — isn’t exactly observed with parades across the Clemente Bridge. The last two years have been especially cruel for the good people of Pittsburgh. Their Pirates were tied for first in the NL Central on July 25, 2011. They held the second wild-card spot as late as Aug. 21, 2012. Both times, they screwed it up. How extraordinary is the Pirates’ ineptitude? Consider this from STATS LLC: During the wild-card era, only one other franchise held a playoff position on July 25 or later in consecutive seasons and finished with a losing record each time: the 2005-2006 Arizona Diamondbacks. To my friends in Western Pennsylvania: I’m sorry. It hurt to type that. Pirates fans lead the league in forbearance, and their reward should come this year. (Full disclosure: I’ve said this before.) But if The Streak reaches 21, well, Pittsburghers have every right to grimace like Bill Cowher after a missed block and demand changes to on- and off-field management. There have been plenty of woeful teams in MLB's past. See which ones are the worst in the last 25 years. Really, what other alternative would ownership have? Another plea for patience? Right. That would be about as popular locally as trading Sidney Crosby to the Flyers. But maybe it won’t come to that. This could be The Year. The Pirates’ core position players are in their primes: Andrew McCutchen, who finished third in last year’s NL MVP vote, is 26. So is third baseman Pedro Alvarez, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2008 amateur draft. Neil Walker, one of the game’s top second basemen, is 27. A.J. Burnett is the closest thing the Pirates have had to a No. 1 starter in a very long time. (In 2012, he became the first Pirate in five years with over 200 innings and a winning record.) Now he’s entering the final year of his contract. If this isn’t it, when exactly would the Pirates have a better chance? “To state it bluntly,” Walker said, “this is an important year.” Neal Huntington is entering his sixth full season as general manager, and it’s entirely fair to frame this year as a referendum on his tenure. Huntington has acquired virtually every significant player on the roster, with the notable exceptions of McCutchen, Walker, right-hander Jared Hughes and left-hander Tony Watson. This is his team. The same is true for manager Clint Hurdle. The 79-win season in 2012 was the Pirates’ best in 15 years, a golf-clap achievement for this particular franchise. The good news: Hurdle’s 151 victories represent the most in a Pittsburgh manager’s first two seasons since Chuck Tanner in 1977 and 1978. The bad: Hurdle also has a .376 combined winning percentage after the All-Star break in ’11 and ’12. In some markets, one second-half fade of that magnitude — let alone two — is enough to fire a manager. Instead, Hurdle’s contract has been extended through 2014 with a club option for 2015. (Huntington also is signed through 2014 with a 2015 option.) To Hurdle, I offer my congratulations. To the team, I ask why. While I agree that Hurdle deserves to keep his job for now, it’s another matter entirely to give him an extension. The move seems unnecessary, given the disappointing conclusion to last season. Hurdle should prove he’s capable of guiding the Pirates through the most trying months of the year before receiving a new contract. If Hurdle is truly the best long-team leader for this team — and he may be — then the team’s 2013 performance will make it obvious. And spare me the supplications that no manager should be forced to endure a lame-duck season. At last check, the men who took their teams to last year’s American League Championship Series — Jim Leyland and Joe Girardi — are entering the final years of their contracts. Cincinnati’s Dusty Baker, with a much better career resume than Hurdle, managed the entire 2012 season without a contract extension; his team finished 18 games ahead of Pittsburgh and won the NL Central title. (Speaking of the division: Pirates fans must hope their shot at a winning season didn’t leave when the Houston Astros departed for the AL. Pittsburgh dominated Houston over the past two years, going 23-12. But the teams will play only one three-game series this year. The Pirates were 16 games under .500 against the rest of the NL Central during the same two seasons.) McCutchen said the players were at fault in last season’s collapse. “It was on us,” he insisted. “That’s the reason we lost. There was nothing else that had to do with it — team chemistry, trades, nothing like that. We didn’t finish the job. We take the blame.” Yet, others on the team acknowledged Monday that the Pirates’ clubhouse dynamic did change around the trade deadline last season. Huntington and Hurdle are among those responsible for the subsequent results; Huntington made the moves in question, and Hurdle failed to mold the new unit into a cohesive group on and off the field. Amid reports that the Pirates were pursuing bigger names, such as Chase Headley and Justin Upton, Huntington dealt for left-handed starter Wandy Rodriguez, right-handed reliever Chad Qualls, outfielder Travis Snider and first baseman Gaby Sanchez. Rodriguez lost four of his first five decisions as a Pirate, while the loss of reliever Brad Lincoln — sent to Toronto for Snider — compromised the bullpen’s depth. “I’m not a GM, but any time you change the team chemistry, it always hurts,” Pirates closer Jason Grilli said. “You change the guys you’re comfortable with, it’s like, ‘Wait a minute. That was a piece we liked, we needed.’ Not that anybody’s asking us for our opinions.” The Pirates made win-now moves at the 2011 non-waiver trade deadline, adding prospective free agents Derrek Lee and Ryan Ludwick. But Huntington took a different approach last year, acquiring three players he could control beyond 2012 — Rodriguez, Snider and Sanchez — in what some interpreted as an acknowledgment of the Pirates’ low-payroll reality. “Maybe some of it’s the economics here,” Grilli said. “Players know the situation. To get a top-tier bat … maybe the expectations were a little higher on our end. That’s not a knock against who we got. It’s just when you’re winning, it’s like, ‘Dude, do you want to go for the gusto here? Do you want to go for the jugular?’ … Pull the trigger. Do you want to win? Do you want to change? “As a player, it’s like, ‘Come on. Let’s see. Give us the pieces.’ Last year, the names being thrown around were (Hunter) Pence, (Shane) Victorino, Upton. … If anybody’s going to do it, you’d think a team that hasn’t won and is in first place would be the first to do it. Let’s not wait.” The Pirates have an above-average farm system, aided in part by favorable drafting positions. That has infused the 25-man roster with talent while providing tradable prospects for Huntington. The amateur scouting operation — led by Greg Smith in the U.S. and Rene Gayo in Latin America — deserves credit for the Pirates’ improved minor league depth. But very soon, those successes must translate into wins. Eighty-two of them, to be exact. When I asked Huntington what would be fair for a Pirates fan to expect this season, he told me, “That’s not for me to decide. Our goal is to be one of those teams playing playoff games in October. Anything short of that is not something we’re looking at right now. Our goal is to win the division. Our goal is to play deep into October and do what the other 29 teams are trying to do — win it all.” Sounds good. But let’s make something clear: The Pirates aren’t like the other 29 teams. No other franchise in this sport — or basketball, or hockey, or football — is trying to halt two decades of losing. Huntington and Hurdle didn’t start The Streak. But it is their job to end it. If they fail, it will be time to start anew in 2014.",Raw Data

It was snowing here Thursday, or at least this is what they kept saying on the news. It looked more like fat rain to my trained eye, not the least bit dangerous. This is the South, though, so the potential of wintry weather is breathlessly dissected tip to buzzer of almost every newscast in Georgia. 1. The Falcons with Matt Ryan and Tony Gonzalez and Asante Samuel, hosting the NFC Championship Game against San Francisco, are a really good story being totally bum-rushed by Skippy the TV weather guy. 2. The weather has freaked out the locals so much so that when I went to get my car the very nice bellman tried to talk me out of it. We went back and forth about how dangerous it was, how I grew up in a snow state, how nobody can drive in Georgia, about how I need to go talk to Atlantans about Falcons former quarterback Michael Vick. “Why?” he asked, and seemed generally confused. “We past that.” People tell me some version of this everywhere I go in this city — the barbershop, the coffee shop, the Falcons training facility in Flowery Branch. It is not simply that they have healed after one of the most divisive moments in this city’s sports history. It is how they came back together that is instructive, especially now as this country seems so divided on everything from guns and abortion to Lance Armstrong. The city is a reminder that what divides us need not divide us forever if we only just remember we are on the same team. Can a city break? Can sports heal? The answer in Atlanta is very much yes to both. The Falcons won a playoff game last Sunday. This should not be a big deal considering they were 13-3 and the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They should have been favorites in the divisional-round game against a talented but young Seattle team. But the Falcons had not won a playoff game since 2004, going 0-for-3 in playoff games since this became quarterback Matt Ryan’s team in the wake of the Vick debacle. We all know that story, how Vick became not simply the face of the franchise but the reason the Falcons and Atlanta mattered. He was their Peyton Manning, their franchise superstar quarterback, only he was black. And in Atlanta, this absolutely mattered. A couple of years after that 2004 playoff victory, he was gone. Convicted of being involved in a dog-fighting ring. Jail time, unbelievably bad press and lying forced the hand of Falcons owner Arthur Blank. He loved Vick; he had to let him go. “I was pulling for him, I wanted him to be our Peyton Manning, a bright shining beacon for our community,” Georgia State Rep. Tyrone Brooks said when we talked Thursday. He represents a district in Atlanta, and I wanted to get his take on this city then and now. “It didn’t work out that way. … Fans were hurt, betrayed in a way. It was a devastating blow to Atlanta.” And the city did break, along the lines we usually break when a fallen hero is black and his replacement white — racial ones. “I heard all of it. I heard it. Believe me, I did,” Brooks said. “Some of that broke out into the racial divide, some into class divide. I had people calling and saying, ‘What about poor people and the homeless? We are more concerned about dogs than people.’ And I heard the racial talk. ‘They are doing it because he’s an African-American quarterback who got big.’ ” Then there are the things Brooks will not quote because it is the mean, ugly talk he heard too often while growing up in the deep South. The fall of Vick brought out the bigots, too, further fueling the need by some to stand with him. This is how years later, when Vick came back in an Eagles uniform in 2009, there were fans cheering for him in the Georgia Dome. When he came back this year, there was no such craziness. “I think we’re probably a little bit beyond that at this point,” Ryan said Thursday. The quarterback is right, though I believe the how is important. How did they heal? It probably is necessary to give a little background on Rep. Brooks, who has served in the Georgia legislature for more than 30 years. He began working for Martin Luther King Jr. in 1967 and stayed on with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference after Dr. King’s assassination. He stayed for almost 20 years, trying to bring justice to Georgia. And once elected in 1980, one of the first bills he spearheaded was to remove the confederate portion of the state flag. It was finally signed into law on Jan. 31, 2001. So Rep. Brooks knows about trying to bridge broken parts. He knows football. It is a comparison he feels comfortable with, and does not shy from answering if there is a lesson to be extrapolated from Atlanta in the aftermath of Vick. “That’s a very deep question. We can find so many things to fight over,” he said. “I’ve seen so many divisions along class lines, regional lines, economic lines in my lifetime. What we learned from the downfall of Michael Vick is if you stick together and stay focused you can come back.” Can sports heal? is a tough question right now as we sit in an unprecedented time of fake girlfriends and lying cancer survivors. Sports feel tainted, their last redeeming qualities a mirage. As we sit days away from a national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., I am reminded of his “I Have a Dream” speech. It is not the part most often quoted about “little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls and walk together as sisters and brothers.” It is right after when he says: “I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.” I can think of no better table of brotherhood than an NFL game, and few fan bases are more of a melting pot than Atlanta's. The Vick thing happened. It was hard. But Atlantans got through it because there came a point when they realized they were all rooting for the same team. “There are times when I still feel like we are fighting the Civil War again. We can be so divided,” Brooks said. “What we have to remember is the real prize.” In football, it is winning. And it can heal even the most broken of cities.",Raw Data

Out West, there are at least four serious title contenders: • The Los Angeles Clippers, who just ended a 17-game winning streak and, despite my own doubts, are respected and feared throughout the league. • The Oklahoma City Thunder, who have managed to be better this season without James Harden and are fresh off their own Finals appearance. • The Memphis Grizzlies, powered by Zach Randolph and a team quietly making a case that it, too, should be feared. • And the San Antonio Spurs, who remain formidable despite a dynastic run the past decade that may be nearing its end. That doesn’t even get into the Los Angeles Lakers, who, if they figure out their own mess, are loaded with talent. And the Golden State Warriors, a middling fifth in the Western Conference playoff picture, which would easily compete for the No. 2 spot in the East. Don’t buy it? If the season ended today, the Dallas Mavericks without Dirk Nowitzki, would finish 12th in the West. They’re a miserable 13-20 through Wednesday. But against the lowly East they’re 8-9. The Houston Rockets are an 18-14 team that looks to have little to no chance to advance far in the playoffs once the Western Conference teams have to battle past one another in April. But against the East? Then the Rockets suddenly seem a juggernaut with a 12-2 mark, with two wins each against the Knicks, Bulls and Hawks, and a win over Boston to boot. Even the lowly, floundering, issue-plagued Sacramento Kings — who are a lowly, floundering, issue-plagued 12-20 — approach respectability when pitted against Eastern Conference teams: 6-7 with, yes, a win against the Knicks. So the Western Conference is a much more formidable place to survive, filled with several title-contending teams and several others that would probably be at the top of the East were they on the other side of the country. At 12-3 against the West, the Heat are, as we all know, very much for real. But the Knicks are just 8-7 against the West, while the Bulls, Nets and Bucks are 40-20 in conference and 10-22 out of conference. Overall, East teams are 81-120 vs. West opponents this season. But that’s only part of the reason the Knicks are paper tigers. Yes, you and I could get a team together that could probably make a run in the East until we had to face the Heat, which means the Knicks are well-positioned. But they’re also a team that shows all the signs of being wildly overhyped, even by Eastern Conference standards. In the history of the NBA, only about a dozen teams have finished the season shooting 40 percent or better from the 3-point line, and during their early-season tear, the Knicks sat well above that mark. The result? They raced to a 10-4 start and became the toast of the NBA. Few bothered to point out that they shot 40 percent or better from the 3-point line in half of those games and better than 36 percent in three others. In fact, so far this season, the Knicks are 13-2 when they shoot better than 40 percent from beyond the arc. Pretty good for a team that leads the league in 3-point shots per game (29.1), right? Wrong. Because when they fall beyond that lofty, unrealistic and already out-of-reach mark, they’re a very so-so 8-9. Already, their 3-point shooting has dropped below that magic line to 38.8 percent. There’s also the uncomfortable fact for Knicks fans that when they shoot lights out from the 3-point line, they beat Miami twice (52.8 and 40.9 percent), San Antonio (42.3), the Nets (50 percent) and the Lakers (48 percent). That’s not a game plan you want to rely on come the playoffs, nor numbers you can count on to win. Those were good times, but they’re starting to look like the good old days. The Knicks have shot better than 40 percent from 3 just once in the past nine games. No wonder they’re 4-5 during that stretch. That bodes particularly bad for future playoff series against teams like Miami, or even Atlanta, Boston or Indiana. There are other issues that will dog the Knicks going forward: the significant regression of their defense from fifth last season in points allowed per 100 possessions (101) to 20th this season (106.3); Amar’e Stoudemire’s return and how that does or does not fit with Anthony; the possibility the Bulls will get Derrick Rose back or that the Pacers will have figured themselves out even before Danny Granger’s return; or that, you know, they’re the Knicks. But for now it’s enough to know that the Knicks are no more a title contender than I am. Don’t let the East’s weakness or the Knicks’ now-fading and always unsustainable early barrage of 3-pointers fool you. They’re not the title contender they’d have you believe.

494,"The F1 tyre challenge has changed again this season with another new collection of Pirellis for 2013 – but how are this year’s options different and what does it mean for the racing? Last year’s tyres put the cars on a knife-edge at the beginning of the season as teams struggled to understand how best to manage the narrow working temperature ranges from track to track. The unpredictability led to seven different winners in the first seven races and it was only in the latter part of the season that the leading teams and drivers worked out what was going on and how to design, set up and drive their cars to get the best out of the tyres. The new tyres are supposed to be much more user friendly and teams first got to try them out in Brazil last year before the final race and again in the opening pre-season test in Jerez. Neither of those gave the right conditions to really get a genuine feel for the tyres but today, at the second pre-season test in Barcelona, the teams will get to do just that. Up to 35 sets of tyres from the entire Pirelli range will be at their disposal on a familiar track with the same tarmac properties and corner types to many of the tracks on the F1 calendar and a wealth of data from past running that will help compare the new with the old. So what can they expect? Put simply, across the range this year’s tyres are softer and faster and will be easier to make work - but on the flipside they will wear down quicker. Tyre development is about compound and construction and Pirelli have changed both this year. They have gone for a stiffer construction overall but they have softened the sidewall and created a stronger shoulder. For the compounds, they have used a more adhesive material that makes this year’s hard tyre, for example, similar to last year’s medium. Tyres heat up through the forces exerted on them as the car drives around the circuit – and by changing the way the tyres are constructed, Pirelli has changed the way the temperature builds within them. The new construction enables more energy to get into the tyres more quickly, but then spreads that energy to enable the tyre to work in a much wider operating window. This wider operating range is important as it means the tyres should be less sensitive to car set-up and easier to work with and manage through the race weekend. The construction has also been designed to use the cornering forces to enable better turn-in and better performance through the corner – as last year they tended to drop away in the middle of a turn. With the tyres able to stay within the ideal working temperature range for longer, the compound should be more effective while a change to a more ‘sticky’ material will also help to increase corner exit traction. Overall, Pirelli claims the new supersoft tyres – the grippiest of the range - could see lap times reduce by around half a second – but it comes at a cost of much more aggressive degradation. Last year, when the tyres dropped off a cliff at the end of their life, it was because the teams were not understanding how they worked. Once they worked it out, the tyres were far more predictable and that resulted in a series of fairly processional races as the level of tyre degradation led to a clear preferred strategy. This year’s tyres are designed to progressively deteriorate more over time – to help introduce unpredictability and vary strategy. The higher wear should lead to a MINIMUM of two tyre changes per race, opening up the strategy options again. And with different drivers on different strategies facing major differences in tyre performance there will be greater potential for overtaking. There will also, however, be a more delicate balance in qualifying as the tyres will quickly get up to temperature but could degrade before the end of a driver’s flying lap if they are not carefully managed. The quick warm-up should also suit drivers with a smoother style – like Jenson Button – but they will also suit those who like a sharper turn-in – like Fernando Alonso. The stickier compound, meanwhile, will provide more mechanical grip and that may reduce the reliance on downforce in higher corners – levelling the playing field for teams with less effective aerodynamics. The compound choice will remain the same – supersoft, soft, medium and hard – but while the compounds have been softened across the board, the gap between them has been widened so now there should be around half a second per lap difference between the different choices – which will also impact the strategy decisions. So there’s a lot to play with in Barcelona – and the teams will be keen to learn quickly as the opening race gets ever closer. Last year, to get an understanding of what the tyres were doing, teams ran infrared sensors that measured the tyre surface temperature at all points of the circuit. It allowed the teams to understand the levels of power they could put through the tyres at different points before losing traction and adjust their engine maps and set-ups to suit – resulting in reduced wheelspin, faster lap times and more predictable single-strategy races. They will now have to go through all that again for the new tyres – although it should take less time because fewer significant car changes means fewer variables to consider. But the big hope from Pirelli is that once the teams work out the tyres, they will still not be able to work around the degradation – so strategies should stay mixed up and we should get exciting races all through the season...",Raw Data
495,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- Nick Kyrgios won an all-Aussie final to capture the boys singles title at the Australian Open on Saturday, while 15-year-old Ana Konjuh of Croatia took home the girls singles and doubles championships. The 17-year-old Kyrgios beat his friend and doubles partner, 16-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis, 7-6 (4), 6-3 on Australia Day, the national holiday. It was the first all-Australian boys final at Melbourne Park since Ben Ellwood defeated Andrew Ilie in 1994. Konjuh, who had former French Open champion and Croatia Fed Cup captain Iva Majoli supporting her from the stands at Rod Laver Arena, defeated 16-year-old Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4. Konjuh is the third girl in the past three years to win both the singles and doubles titles at the Australian Open, following An-Sophie Mestach of Belgium in 2011 and American Taylor Townsend last year. She will also rise to the top of the junior rankings after the tournament. ""Just the feeling is incredible,"" Konjuh said. ""That experience, the crowd, you know, it's all a big thing. I just hope in the future I'm going to come back."" Konjuh combined with Carol Zhao of Canada to win the girls doubles title. Kyrgios said it was an honor to play on Rad Laver Arena the day after Andy Murray edged Roger Federer in five sets in the men's semifinals on Friday night. ""It was obviously a great experience being out there knowing that Federer and Murray were grinding it out the night before,"" Kyrgios said. ""I thought the level of tennis out there today was really good. Didn't seem that we were really nervous."" An Australian pair, Jay Andrijic and Bradley Mousley, won the boys doubles title.",Raw Data
496,"Gomez, making a rare start in place of the team's top scorer Mario Mandzukic, scored the only goal of a lacklustre game when he flicked in a Franck Ribery header in the 38th minute as Bayern grabbed their 11th away win this season and their seventh straight victory this year. The Bavarians, who made five changes to the team that ousted holders Borussia Dortmund from the German Cup on Wednesday, lacked pace in attack but were rarely threatened by lowly Hoffenheim. Bayern's 20th win in 24 league games lifted them to 63 points, with champions Dortmund second on 46. ""It was a laborious victory. It was not sparkling and it was not brilliant but even for this you get three points,"" Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes told reporters. ""It was tough because our opponents have their backs to the wall. ""We were not lively enough at the start and it took some time until the motor was warmed up,"" added Heynckes, whose team face Arsenal in the return leg of their Champions League round of 16 this month. Bayern were without winger Arjen Robben, who was again ruled out with a muscle injury, and Hoffenheim briefly threatened in the opening stages with two long-range efforts from Daniel Williams. The visitors gradually found their rhythm and Gomez rounded off a lightning quick move that started with Hoffenheim losing possession in midfield to give Bayern the lead. Bayern were playing well below par, but had chances to extend their lead in the second half. Bastian Schweinsteiger twice rattled the woodwork with free kicks and David Alaba drew a spectacular late save from Hoffenheim keeper Heurelho Gomes. Hoffenheim, 17th on 16 points and five points below the relegation play-off spot, defended bravely throughout but were toothless up front. In the only other game on Sunday, Mainz missed the chance to move back into European contention with a 1-1 draw at Fortuna Duesseldorf to stay eighth on 34 points. Dortmund remained second after easing past Hanover 96 3-1 on Saturday with two goals from Robert Lewandowski, who is reportedly close to signing a deal with Bayern. Bayer Leverkusen are a point behind in third after coming from a goal down to score twice in the last eight minutes and beat Stuttgart 2-1 on Saturday.",Raw Data
497,"Angered by Goodell's handling of the New Orleans Saints' bounties scandal, Fujita accused the commissioner of misusing his power, questioned his record on player safety, and the Browns linebacker vowed to keep fighting to clear his name. ''The commissioner says he is disappointed in me,'' Fujita said. ''The truth is, I'm disappointed in him.'' One day after Goodell reduced his three-game suspension to one for alleged involvement in the Saints' pay-for-hits program and ruled on the penalties for three other players, Fujita took on the commissioner in a strongly worded statement. Fujita charged Goodell with ''abuse of power'' and expressed his displeasure with the way his suspension was lessened. On Tuesday, Goodell sent Fujita a letter in which he chastised the 10-year veteran and member of the NFL Players Association's executive committee for not doing more to stop his former teammates in New Orleans from taking part in the ''bounty'' program. Goodell wrote to Fujita that he was ''surprised and disappointed by the fact that you, a former defensive captain and a passionate advocate for player safety, ignored such a program and permitted it to continue. ... . If you had spoken up, perhaps other players would have refused to participate and the consequences with which we are now dealing could have been avoided.'' Fujita was angered by the ''condescending tone'' in Goodell's letter - and most of its content. ''For him to come out and say he was disappointed in me for not standing up to my coach,'' Fujita said after practice Wednesday. ''I haven't had someone tell me they were disappointed in me since I was 12 years old, and that was my father.'' Fujita was pleased Goodell all but exonerated him from any involvement in the Saints' mess, but was incensed the commissioner felt it necessary to chastise him for not stepping in and trying to stop the rogue program. Another week of NFL action kicked butt and we have all the hard hits. Check out the best images. ''I thought it was uncalled for and inappropriate,'' Fujita said. Fujita will appeal his one-game suspension and intends to play Sunday when the winless Browns (0-5) host the Cincinnati Bengals. Fujita has maintained his innocence in the scandal since it first broke in March. Seven months later, Fujita hasn't changed his stance and felt a recent Sept. 28 meeting with Goodell was ''respectful and productive,'' which is why he's puzzled the commissioner would come down so hard. ''I went in and no punches were thrown,'' Fujita said of meeting Goodell in New York. ''Everybody was kind. So, yeah, I was a little bit taken aback by it. It didn't have to go there at all. It just felt like one more personal jab.'' After reading Goodell's letter, Fujita said he began preparing a statement to rebuke the commissioner. Fujita's wife, Jaclyn, urged him to ''cool down and sleep on it'' before he sent something he would regret. For Fujita, Goodell's implication that he was hypocritical about player safety hurt most. ''For him to speak to me as if I'm cavalier about player health and safety, that's when I said enough is enough,'' Fujita said. The way Fujita sees it, Goodell overstepped his boundaries. ''It's just a power-run-amok situation,'' he said. ''Obviously, the scope of the conduct-detrimental powers that have been afforded him are broad, but there has been clear abuse of power that has been afforded to him.'' In his statement, Fujita said Goodell's new ruling ''seems like an extremely desperate attempt to punish me. I also think it sets a dangerous precedent when players can be disciplined for not challenging the behavior of their superiors. This is an absolute abuse of the power that's been afforded to the Commissioner.'' Fujita said if the wording in Goodell's letter had not been so offensive he may have accepted the lesser suspension without a fight. On Tuesday, Goodell upheld the suspensions of Jonathan Vilma and Will Smith and reduced penalties for Fujita and Anthony Hargrove. Vilma will sit out the entire season and Smith's punishment stands at four games. Hargrove, a free agent defensive lineman, will face a two-game suspension once he signs with a team. He originally was hit with eight games, but that was reduced to seven with five games already served. The players were implicated in what the NFL said was a bounty pool run by former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams and paid improper cash bonuses for hits that injured opponents. The players have acknowledged a pool but denied they intended to injure anyone. Fujita insists the bounty program never existed. Goodell's new ruling comes about a month after an appeals panel created by the NFL's labor agreement vacated the original suspensions on technical grounds during Week 1 of the regular season. The panel informed Goodell he needed to clarify the reasons for the punishment. Fujita feels a personal connection to the player safety issue. He was at the bargaining table for the players during contract talks when they successfully fought for changes. Fujita's close friend and former Saints teammate Steve Gleason is afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, an incurable disease that medical studies say could be lined to head injuries. Fujita knows his fight's not over. And he's not worried about any repercussions for his criticism of Goodell. ''This is how I feel about things,'' he said with a shrug. ''I've been very clear about it since back in March, so I don't think it could get any worse.''",Raw Data
498,"﻿Late last month, Joe Hughes turned to social media to announce his diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the lymph nodes. In the weeks since, the former Xavier basketball player has used Twitter to tell jokes, provide updates and connect with new friends. It turns out he has people everywhere pulling for him. And lots of them are tweeting about it. The news hit Hughes, 24, hard, and his medical tests and treatments have, too. The best news he's shared on Twitter is that doctors told him there's a 90 percent survival rate when Hodgkin's lymphoma is found and treated properly. A walk-on at Xavier from 2007-11, Hughes works as an accountant in Cincinnati. He grew up in Indianapolis, and on the day before his first chemotherapy treatment last week he received a hand-written note from Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano, who missed a chunk of last season while battling leukemia. The Colts adopted the motto of #ChuckStrong during Pagano's fight, and several of Hughes' friends have started using #HughesStrong on Twitter. That Twitter campaign has led to another, more public display of support for Hughes' fight back on Xavier's campus. The week of his diagnosis, Hughes presented the MVP trophy after the Xavier-Dayton rivalry game to Xavier guard Dee Davis. He then spoke to some reporters for the first time about what's ahead and the support he already had received, and he took some liberties when it came to his close friend and current Xavier senior guard Brad Redford. ""Joe, just being his sarcastic self, told the media that Brad had promised to shave his head in a show of support if a certain tweet got to 1,000 retweets,"" Xavier coach Chris Mack said. ""This was unbeknownst to Brad. They had never even talked about that. ""I think Brad felt too much pressure not to go through with it. No one there that night knew it was a practical joke. That's Joe Hughes in a nutshell."" The tweet sent by Xavier graduate assistant and Hughes' former teammate, Dante Jackson, eventually got the requisite number of retweets. Redford, though, had already made up his mind to shave his head, and the iPhone video cameras were rolling when Redford got his buzz cut. ""Joe's reaction when he saw it was laughter, and a lot of it,"" Redford said. ""I don't think I've ever seen Joe laugh that hard. These guys know I've never worn my hair this short, and that I've taken both time and pride in making sure my hair looks good. They'd bust me on that. And now they're really having fun with it."" Xavier reserve forward Erik Stenger and several team managers have shaved their heads, too. The #HughesStrong effort has continued on Twitter, with Mack and former Xavier coach Sean Miller, now at Arizona, also offering public support and more of Hughes friends, in Cincinnati and Indianapolis, tweeting pictures of their freshly-shaved heads. ""I see (Redford) every day but it was a little different at the beginning. We're still getting used to his new look,"" Mack said. ""It's for a great cause. Joe is not only a great friend of Brad's but of our entire program. We're praying for him."" Hughes said his initial reaction to his diagnosis was ""natural, to cry"" and wonder why it happened. He's now focusing on pushing through his treatments, which doctors have said will last six to eight months, to get healthy and have him at 100 percent for his marriage to longtime girlfriend Kelly Hanley, scheduled for the summer of 2014. ""It was definitely tough to hear,"" Hughes said. ""I was scared. You think about the worst. ""I've tried to focus on the positive. You can always think about the negatives. I try to stay as a positive as I can. It's very cool to see how much support I've already received from friends, family and the Xavier community in general. It's very cool.""",Raw Data
499,"A Night of Validation Rodmans ceremony celebrates his, Bad Boys greatness by George Blaha Lou Capozzola/NBAE/Getty Images When you think about all the people whove played for the Pistons in the 54 years since theyve been around in Detroit and realize that only seven men have been honored to have their names hanging above the court at The Palace and that five of them were directly involved with the Bad Boys, you realize what a special group that was. Dennis Rodman will make it eight on Friday night and six of them who either played for, coached or built the Bad Boys when you talk about Jack McCloskey and Chuck Daly, as well. Jack made some terrific picks and certainly Dennis Rodman was one of those. He chose a guy in round two who turned out to be one of the greatest rebounders and defenders of all-time and a guy who, along with John Salley, was the final piece of the puzzle that made the Pistons an all-time great team. That era of Pistons basketball is one for the ages. There might never be another one like that one. We witnessed a great run by the Goin to Work group in the 2000s. Those guys probably should have won another title and maybe they would be talked about in much the same way the Bad Boys were. But the bottom line is the Bad Boys won two, should have won a third, I believe, and could have won a fourth. They were that good. They became a team that could terrorize the opposition when Dennis Rodman and John Salley came into the fold. Look at the names hanging from the rafters a Hall of Fame coach; an all-time great GM; and then Isiah and Joe, Hall of Famers who played in the backcourt together; Vinnie Johnson, who was as hard to guard as any off-the-bench player in the history of basketball; and Bill Laimbeer, who was one of the great competitors of all time, a terrific clutch player and, like Dennis, a great rebounder. Add all of that up and you have a team that, no matter what anybody else wants to say, nobody wanted to play against and almost nobody could beat. In my opinion, the 1980s was the greatest decade ever in the NBA. Just look at the luminaries who played in the 80s, from big men like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing, to the all-time greats who played small forward like Larry Bird and Dr. J, to Hall of Famers such as Adrian Dantley and George Gervin, and then add Magic Johnson and Isiah and some other great guards to that list. I dont see how any decade will ever compare with that one. It was so hard to win in the 80s and when you did and the Pistons did you were going up against the best teams that ever played. To win two championships and to do it as convincingly as the Pistons did and to be right there with the chance to win a couple more that makes the Pistons one of the all-time great teams. If anybody wants to quarrel with the fact they were a physical basketball team, they should go back and look at everybody else in the 80s. When the Bulls won those titles in the 90s, the talent level was nowhere near as high and the game was far less physical. If you were going to win in the 80s, you better be good and tough and you better be smart. Because some of the smartest men whove ever played the game played in the 80s. No matter what, the Bad Boys rank as an all-time great team. So Friday nights ceremony to retire Dennis Rodmans number will be a celebration of Dennis and also a celebration of the greatness of that team. The only bit of sadness about the night is that its a shame that Mr. Davidson and Chuck Daly wont be at The Palace to see Dennis number raised to the rafters. Mr. D loved his team and every one of his players and he certainly had a soft spot in his heart for Dennis. Chuck Daly was like a father to Dennis. He cared about him, nurtured him, believed in him and was very, very proud of what Dennis did. I know somewhere Chuck Daly is smiling. I know somewhere Chuck Daly will be smiling as he looks down on this ceremony. Its a shame he cant be there, but believe me, Chucks presence will be felt in the building on Friday night.",Raw Data

Check out all the best moments from Jose Mourinho's impressive career so far. On Thursday, Perez called a press conference at which he angrily denied the initial Marca story, and later the two players named by the newspaper - club captains Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos - issued a statement to reject the report. They claimed the newspaper's account of their lunch with Perez was ""entirely false"" and stated their support for Mourinho. Perez had claimed that the lunch was only to discuss player bonuses, but Marca has responded with a front-page story standing by their report. ""MARCA does not lie,"" its headline said. The story stated: ""The information published in this paper on Thursday regarding the dinner held last Tuesday at ACS headquarters between Florentino Perez, Jose Angel Sanchez and the Real Madrid captains Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos is absolutely true, point for point."" The story was accompanied by a photograph of a text message from Marca's unnamed source - who they state is a player - reiterating that the conversation touched on several matters, including Mourinho. ""We spoke about everything. General matters, the dressing room, the manager, bonuses and the like,"" the text message said. Marca had claimed that Casillas and Ramos warned Perez that several players would seek transfers if Mourinho continued as coach into another season. You'll be amazed by how much money the world's biggest clubs make. Check out the top 20 from 2012.

Reports of infighting between the outspoken coach, his playing staff and several club directors have never been far from the surface, while the former Chelsea and Inter Milan boss courted controversy recently by dropping captain Casillas from successive league games. There have been high points this season, with Madrid safely into the last 16 of the Champions League and into the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey after completing a 3-1 aggregate win over Valencia on Wednesday night.

Torino did go close to winning the game, but head coach Giampiero Ventura will nonetheless be satisfied with a point which cements his side's position in mid-table. Inter took the lead early on through Chivu, after Torino's protests were dismissed when Antonio Cassano went to ground easily on the edge of the penalty area. From the resultant free-kick, the Romanian defender curled the ball over the wall and beyond the reach of Jean-Francois Gillet. Rather than looking to build on their lead, though, Inter sat back and invited pressure on to themselves. Torino duly obliged and struck back in the 24th minute through Meggiorini, who rifled in from the edge of the penalty area after Fredy Guarin lost possession cheaply. Meggiorini came through the Nerazzurri's youth ranks and has made a habit of punishing his former club. He did so again in the 52nd minute when he put the Granata in front. Alessio Cerci delivered an inch-perfect cross from the right which Meggiorini met at the near post and, with the inside of his right foot, he guided it into the far corner. It was now Inter's turn to chase the game and Cambiasso missed a good chance to level in the 62nd minute when he lifted a shot over the crossbar from eight yards out. He did not waste his next chance, though, bringing Inter level in the 66th minute with a simple tap-in after Javier Zanetti had done all of the hard work to get to the goal-line before pulling the ball across to his team mate. Torino were not going to settle for a point and a fine one-handed save from Samir Handanovic prevented substitute Rolando Bianchi from putting them in front again in the 71st minute as he pushed the ball onto a post. Il Toro nearly snatched all three points, but Meggiorini was denied his hat-trick by Handanovic.",Raw Data

''At least from my perspective, it's really good,'' he said, outlining the current regime where tennis players have to give anti-doping authorities details of their whereabouts each day, in case they're required for out-of-competition testing. ''It gives them an opportunity to test you. And you know it is the same for the other players,'' he said. ''At least from that point of view it's fair. And I have nothing against, you know, the anti-doping federation, association, testing me 10, 20, 30 times a year.'' Having said that, Djokovic admitted blood tests which can detect the presence of EPO, a known oxygen booster in the blood which could help a tennis player cope better in long rallies and extended matches, have been a rarity for him lately. He was asked to respond to reports that ITF records show that in 2011, only 18 blood tests were taken of the top players. ''Yeah, I wasn't tested with blood for last six, seven months,'' Djokovic said. ''It was more regular ... two, three years ago. I don't know the reason why they stopped it.'' Maria Sharapova said after her win over Venus Williams later Friday that the Armstrong revelations are ''just a really sad story, sad for that sport.'' ''I'm happy that our sport is as clean as it can be and that we're constantly tested,'' she said. ''So as long as we're getting tested, whatever it takes, urine, blood, we're all here to make the sport as clean as it can be.'' Djokovic also said he's confident of the integrity of tennis. ''I believe tennis players are (among) the cleanest athletes in the world,'' Djovovic said. ''So as long as we keep it that way, I have no complaints about testing.'' He admitted there have been complaints about the ''whereabouts'' rule where players have to let drug-testing authorities know where they plan to be - either at a tournament, training, or even on holidays, so that testing can be conducted. Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who lost his third-round match to Janko Tipsarevic on Friday, said Armstrong was ''a liar and a cheat for years'' and ''he has to pay.'' He said there was enough drug testing in tennis, but ''if there were more, that would be better.'' ''I'm tested about 10-15 times a year,'' the No. 32-seeded Benneteau said. ''More controls. More blood testing, we don't have much of that.'' ''We can't be naive. No sport is sheltered from it,'' he said. ''In tennis it's not just physical. It's technical and mental. But we still need to stay vigilant.'' Djokovic's Serbian Davis Cup teammate Janko Tipsarevic said he'd been subjected to doping tests in out-of-competition periods, and as far away as Africa. Testers ''actually came to Kenya to test me,'' he said. ''I wasn't going to Kenya to hide from anti-doping. I was actually doing my pre-season there.'' Sharapova, like Tipsarevic, had a drug test at an inopportune time - her birthday. ''They did a couple of years ago, and I said, (if) `you bring flowers, I'm OK with it,' but they came empty-handed,'' she said, smiling. Djokovic had been a lifelong cycling fan but was saddened by the drug-tainted nature of the sport. ''I've lost a lot of faith in cycling,'' he said. ''I used to watch it. All the big champions that were there.''",Raw Data

505,"Remember when Kobe Bryant almost became a Piston? Most fans don't, judging from the surprise that spread across Twitter on Monday night when a Yahoo! story about the death of Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss mentioned the discussions he had with Bryant about the deal in 2007. As reported at the time, the Pistons had worked out a trade with the Lakers that would have brought Bryant to the Motor City in exchange for Rip Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, Amir Johnson and a first-round draft pick. The deal would have given the Pistons a roster that included Bryant, Chauncey Billups, Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess. Rodney Stuckey was a rookie, and Jason Maxiell was in his second season with the team. The trade would have also meant more time for Aaron Afflalo and fan favorite Walter Herrmann. After Bryant vetoed the trade, the Pistons went 59-23 under Flip Saunders and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals, where they lost to Boston in six games. Saunders was fired after the season and replaced by Michael Curry, and Billups was traded to the Nuggets for Allen Iverson. The Pistons were swept by Cleveland in the 2009 postseason their last playoff appearance. Iverson's cap space was filled by Charlie Villanueva and Ben Gordon. Hamilton was eventually released and now plays for Chicago, and Prince was traded to Memphis last month. Johnson was let go in a salary-cap move and is now with Toronto. Things worked out a lot better for Bryant in Los Angeles. The Lakers went to the finals in 2008 losing to Boston and then won the next two NBA titles.",Raw Data
506,"Theo Walcott came off the bench to fire Arsenal into the fifth round of the FA Cup with a thrilling 3-2 victory at Brighton. Manager Arsene Wenger had made several changes from the side which thumped West Ham 5-1 in the Barclays Premier League on Wednesday night, but eventually the Gunners had enough to see off the npower Championship side, who had twice levelled. In-form Olivier Giroud fired the visitors ahead on 16 minutes before Ashley Barnes equalised with a powerful header. Giroud netted again on 56 minutes with another well-taken strike, but the Seagulls were level again through a diving header from Argentinian forward Leonardo Ulloa on his debut after joining from Almeria. Arsenal finally made sure of a place in the last 16, though, when Walcott's shot was deflected in following a corner with five minutes left. Brighton, hoping to add to their third-round scalp of Newcastle here, started brightly with Will Buckley making some headway down the right channel. On 15 minutes a floated a ball in from the left over a static Arsenal defence saw Barnes clear on goal with no offside flag. However, Wojciech Szczesny was quickly off his line to narrow the angle and made a superb reaction save to push the ball past the post. It proved decisive as Arsenal went up the other end and opened the scoring. As he had been against West Ham, Lukas Podolski was again the provider, creating space on the edge of the penalty area before feeding Giroud, who curled the ball into the bottom left corner for a third goal of the week. The early goal settled any nerves as Arsenal now allowed themselves more time on the ball. Brighton, though, refused to lie down and again created problems through the right channel, with a close-range flick from Ulloa booted away in a crowded six-yard box. The Seagulls thought they had levelled when Inigo Calderon robbed Andre Santos 20 yards out and surged to the goalline before cutting a pass back through the penalty area. Szczesny palmed the ball away, which was slotted in by Ulloa, but the offside flag was up straight away. Brighton, though, were level on 33 minutes. A short corner was whipped in from the right, and Barnes charged through a sea of red shirts to get to the ball before Szczesny and power a header into the back of the net. The home side were forced into a change when captain Gordon Greer hobbled off with what looked like a thigh injury to be replaced by Gary Dicker. At the start of the second half, Arsenal full-back Carl Jenkinson got in on the overlap down the right after a surging run by Rosicky, but his snapshot was beaten away by Brighton goalkeeper Casper Ankergren. On 52 minutes, Oxlade-Chamberlain was fouled 20 yards out by Adam El-Abd. Podolski lined up the free-kick, which he looped over the wall and crashed against the crossbar. Arsenal were back in front on 56 minutes with another brilliant finish from Giroud. Diaby floated an angled pass into the left side of the penalty area, where Frenchman Giroud held off El-Abd, took the sting out of the ball with a lovely first touch and then lashed it into the net from six yards. Giroud came close to chalking up a hat-trick soon after as Rosicky's pass split the Brighton defence, but this time the keeper made a good save to beat away his angled drive from the edge of the penalty area. Brighton, though, refused to lie down and were back on level terms after 62 minutes. Arsenal again failed to deal with a cross from the right as Barnes' ball in was dispatched past Szczesny with a diving header by Ulloa. With 20 minutes left, Wenger sent on Walcott and Jack Wilshere, replacing Rosicky and Oxlade-Chamberlain. Podolski got away down the left and cut the ball back for Giroud, but this time the France striker could only hack a half-volley wide. An acrobatic effort from the Arsenal number 12 was then put behind, and from the resulting corner Walcott won it when his shot was deflected off El-Abd and into the net to send the Gunners through to Sunday's fifth-round draw.",Raw Data

508,"Roberto Mancinis team have won all of their five games so far this month without even conceding a goal, the latest success catapulting them into the FA Cup fifth round. And it is the fear of letting the Red Devils extend their five-point lead at the top of the Premier League that has been spurring City on. Midfielder Gareth Barry explained: ""That gap at the top between us and United is there, so we cant afford to let that grow any more. We want to end up as Premier League champions again, so that has made all the lads really knuckle down."" With Yaya Toure going on Africa Cup of Nations duty, it made it a bit tougher but weve really got together as a team and got some great results. In fact, City have now racked up six straight wins on the trot, with the latest giving them hope of going all the way in the FA Cup once again. They won this competition in 2011, beating Stoke in the final. And victory over the Potters has brought the chance of another visit to Wembley a step nearer. Barry said: ""Of course the FA Cup was always a priority, but with us out of Europe its going to be massive for us if we can get to Wembley."" That view was echoed by assistant manager David Platt, who said: ""Winning the FA Cup gives you a belief you can do it again. It certainly gives you the taste that you want to do it again. The hunger is there and its a great feeling. The target of this club is to win trophies, thats what we are set up to do. Its what the manager wants to do. He wants to win everything he is in and its important because when we set off every season we set off to win things. We feel we are involved in both competitions and have the capability of winning both."" Citys latest win came courtesy of one of their most consistent defenders, Pablo Zabaleta. Barry said: ""Zabas had a fantastic season. He always gives 100 per cent and since Ive been here, hes never had a bad game."" He is a fans favourite and this season is popping up with some vital goals. Zabaleta and his fellow defenders will have to cope without Vincent Kompany at QPR tomorrow, though. The City skipper limped off after just 33 minutes with a calf injury, which will force Mancini to juggle an already depleted defence. While City had to reorganise their defence, they were still never troubled by a woeful Stoke. And it all left dejected Potters manager Tony Pulis praising the victors, rather than chastising his own team. He said: ""I dont want to be too down or too despondent because of who we were playing against.""",Raw Data
509,"Print Eurosport - FIFA hope that 'all players participating at the 2014 FIFA World Cup' will have 'biological profiles' The commitment comes after a meeting between the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey and FIFA president Sepp Blatter this week. Before the meeting, Fahey had said that football was not testing enough for the blood-boosting agent EPO, which requires blood tests. Three out of every four players tested at World Cup qualifiers will not have EPO tests. Fahey said earlier this week: ""I simply say this about football - they are not testing enough for EPO. They can do more and we encourage them to do more."" He also called on the domestic leagues to do more to add to FIFA's testing. After the meeting with Blatter, Fahey praised the commitment made, especially to biological profiles which can indicate hormone use and blood doping. Fahey said: ""We are very interested in continuing the work on biological profiles. ""WADA is very satisfied with the commitment of FIFA on the biological profiles, which will be run not only at the FIFA World Cup in 2014 but already at the FIFA Confederations Cup in June this year.""

510,"MILWAUKEE While many big name American baseball players decided against the opportunity to represent their country at the World Baseball Classic, Brewers left fielder Ryan Braun didn't have to think twice. In fact, it was a no-brainer. If he was healthy, Braun was going to don the red, white and blue. ""First and foremost, it's an honor,"" Braun said. ""It's a tremendous honor to have an opportunity to represent your country. You don't know how many opportunities you are going to have to do that. This tournament only happens once every four years and four years from now who knows for all of us what our health situation would be, where we'll be in the game and even have an opportunity to be invited."" Like all players participating in the World Baseball Classic, Braun's offseason routine was altered due to the tournament starting in early March. Unlike the relaxed feel of spring training games, the WBC puts players in intense competition a month earlier than usual. In a normal year, Braun wouldn't start his hitting until sometime in January, but this season he was long tossing in November and hitting full-go in December. While he wasn't sure the earlier start to baseball activity would give him an advantage on Opening Day, Braun went into the offseason with the mindset of preparing himself to play meaningful innings for Team USA in March. ""I like our chances,"" Braun said of Team USA. ""On paper we certainly have a great team. It's challenging for us in that it is a little earlier than when guys are normally in their best shape. We are obviously not in midseason form at the beginning of the season, but I know everybody is ready to play. I'm really excited about it and looking forward to it."" Unlike last offseason, Braun could focus on adjustments to his baseball routine, rather than off the field issues. This winter, Braun was able to finally relax and have some downtime, something valuable for his mindset. ""It was definitely, definitely a lot different for me,"" Braun said. ""It is just nice to be able to relax and have a normal routine and know exactly what I'm getting myself into."" In a light-hearted mood, Braun joked about playing with teammate Jonathan Lucroy on Team USA, saying ""I didn't know Team USA had a bullpen catcher so I'm excited."" Even though Braun suffered through the distraction of a failed drug test that was overturned on appeal, the 29-year-old still finished second in the National League MVP race. With his focus on baseball heading into this season, Brewers manager Ron Roenicke says an even bigger year is possible. ""When Ryan is healthy, Ryan can have a better year than he had last year and a better year than he had the year before,"" Roenicke said. ""He is capable of doing that. We need to keep him on the field and keep him healthy. ""If he wants to hit for power, he's going to hit for power. If he wants to hit for average, he's going to hit for average. There's not much he can't do."" Improvement for a player the caliber of Braun is sometimes hard to gauge. He hit .319 with 41 home runs and 112 RBI last season and probably will put up a similar line in 2013. While many players would trade anything for those numbers, Braun is focused on little things that will make him an even better player. One goal for this season is to walk more. ""I think the challenge is always longevity and consistency,"" Braun said. ""Hopefully I can continue to have success. There's always room for improvement. ""Defense has always been something I've tried to prioritize and I think I'm headed in the right direction. Hopefully I can continue to get better defensively."" As for his outlook for the team's chances this season, Braun is optimistic the Brewers have the pieces to be in the mix for the playoffs again. ""I think the talent is there,"" Braun said. ""It is about going out and doing it over the course of a season. Because we now have depth, we have starting pitching depth, but relatively inexperienced we don't know exactly what they are going to do, but aside from that we are certainly going to be competitive again. As long as you are competitive, that's all you can ask for.""",Raw Data
511,"Luis Suarez celebrates scoring against SwanseaLiverpool’s 5-0 thumping of Swansea was a good response to two poor results in the week, but Brendan Rodgers is still six to 12 months away from having a consistent team capable of challenging the top four. It was a great way to answer the critics. You can have question marks against the team Swansea put out, who not only seemed weakened but unmotivated. It has been said they had one eye on the League Cup final, but they had both eyes on it if you ask me. You can’t blame them though, as it’s their first opportunity to win a major trophy. For Liverpool though it was a fantastic performance. They created a lot of opportunities and – unlike against West Brom and Zenit St Petersburg – they stood up and took them. When Liverpool score first they look like a top team; when they concede they struggle, fall apart even. That is down to inner confidence, which they clearly lack. Part of that is cyclical – the run of not beating any of the top teams plays on their minds. They lack a bit of belief in being able to beat them precisely because they haven’t beaten them. That side of Liverpool’s confidence will come one step at a time. They have just beaten a top-10 side, so they now know they have the ability to do it. Previously they had put in great performances against the best sides in the country, but finished empty handed. They should have beaten Manchester City twice, and when they were leading 2-1 at the Emirates they did not look like a team who believed they could hold on to a lead. When Liverpool are at it, they are as good as anyone; when they are not, they can be poor. I think we will have another six to 12 months of what we have seen from Liverpool recently. Some great performances, some poor ones, and a general inconsistency and fragile confidence. That will take a while to iron out, it will come with experience, as they grow accustomed to the new style of play, and it will come with results. Zenit are an example of a team Liverpool will continue to struggle against. Liverpool did create chances against them but didn’t take them. Zenit are a physical team and one packed with quality – I think they’ll enjoy coming to Anfield, and I don’t think Liverpool can turn it around. If you want to play, Zenit will play; if you want to stand up to them they’re happy to get physical. They have a perfect mix of Latin and European players, foreign flair and local grafters. They have top class if not world class players, players who know their way around a pitch and are capable of great goals. Hulk is a great example of someone who is both technically gifted and streetwise. And, as we touched on earlier, once Liverpool went 1-0 down they lost their heads a bit and it was an uphill task. Liverpool will miss Daniel Sturridge – who has given exactly what they previously lacked in front of goal – and Philippe Coutinho, both of whom are cup-tied in Europe. Sturridge is a big addition but an equally big loss in Europe. Coutinho probably had the perfect opportunity to make an impact as you never get a physical game against Swansea. It won’t be that way against Sunderland as some of the qualities he’s lacking will be exposed against teams like that, but then that’s what Sturridge is for. They were good acquisitions, and vital now that poor Fabio Borini is out for the season. How unlucky can you be? People were unsure when Liverpool signed him for big money and he is desperate to make an impression. He’s probably guilty of trying too hard to show what he can do, to show that – while not the biggest – he can handle the physical side, and as a result he has picked up two bad injuries. I feel incredibly sorry for him but he’ll have to cope, show some mental strength and bounce back for next season. He’s got time on his side because of his youth but his first 12 months at Liverpool will have been a nightmare from him, one he’ll do well to forget. He’ll learn and come back stronger, but as with Liverpool in general I don’t think you’ll see the best of him this year.",Raw Data
512,"Brumbies too slick for Rebels 30-13 22 Feb 2013, 10:47 pm - Source: AAP Share This 0 0 0 The Brumbies have delivered an impressive performance to romp to a 30-13 win over the Melbourne Rebels in their Super Rugby match at AAMI Park. The Brumbies added the Melbourne Rebels' scalp to their growing collection with a clinical 30-13 win in their Super Rugby clash at AAMI Park. After accounting for Queensland in the opening round, the Brumbies delivered an emphatic second-half performance to stamp themselves as the Australian conference heavyweights. The Rebels led 13-12 at halftime but they were starved of ball in the second stanza and injuries to their attacking maestros James O'Connor and Kurtley Beale cruelled their chances as the Brumbies piled on 18 unanswered points. O'Connor was steamrolled by veteran Brumbies winger Clyde Rathbone while making a try-saving tackle and left the field to be checked for concussion. He looked set to return at the 55-minute mark but was frustratingly over-ruled by the team doctor, who benched him for the remainder of the game. Around the same time Beale hurt his left shoulder while making a tackle and while he played on until the final five minutes he clearly struggled. Those two players fired in the first half as the home side matched the Brumbies across the park. O'Connor set up the Rebels only try, scored by their new recruit Scott Higginbotham in the 18th minute, while Wallabies five-eighth Beale was a constant danger. Brumbies fullback Jesse Mogg was just as dynamic for his team, scoring a try and setting up another in the first half. Mogg, the two-try hero from the Brumbies win over the Reds, was first on the scoreboard in the fourth minute after Beale turned over the ball when he was crunched midfield. The fullback showed scintillating speed when he ran on to a Rathbone pass and then he burnt both O'Connor and Nick Phipps to the ball that he had kicked into the in-goal. Mogg also set up their second try, scored by Rathbone, who has returned to Super Rugby after four years on the sidelines with a midfield break. The Brumbies were quick to close their one-point halftime deficit, through a penalty strike by Christian Lealiifano and the momentum of the match quickly swung their way. As the home side's injury toll mounted the Brumbies grew in stature. After skipper Ben Mowen showed his pace to scoop up a loose ball and charge to the line, they grabbed their bonus point with a fourth try in the 74th minute, scored by replacement back Robbie Coleman. Beale was due to have scans on his shoulder with Rebels coach Damien Hill unwilling to speculate on the seriousness of his injury. He said O'Connor had already recovered from his head knock better than hoped. Hill was delighted by his team's first half performance but said they lost composure when things didn't go their way later in the game. ""In the first half we stuck to the game plan and played with intent. ""The breakdown was good, the set-piece was good, defence was great ... we were in the game. ""The second half we seemed to go away from that a little bit and a little bit of panic set in, around those injuries I think. ""Against a team like the Brumbies, it's going to result in what you saw tonight."" Brumbies coach Jake White said his side showed great composure, led by skipper Ben Mowen and new recruit David Pocock. He said the calibre of players that the Rebels lost to injury made it difficult for them to remain competitive. Mowen felt his side was out-enthused early on. ""We needed to flick that switch mentally,"" he said. ""The second half was much better."" Beale said post-match that while the joint was very sore he was confident of making a quick recovery. He said the shoulder dislocated and then popped straight back in - an injury he had suffered twice previously without missing any game time. He will go for precautionary scans with the Rebels sweating on the results ahead of a clash with Beale's old side the Waratahs in Sydney next Friday night. Follow us:",Raw Data
513,"Our team, the one that was supposed to win an NBA title this year, can barely win a game. Once we talked about posting the best record in NBA history; now we openly wonder whether we’ll post a winning record at all. Still, I don’t expect any sympathy. This is what it’s like to be a fan of the Lakers: You are over three times more likely to see your team win the NBA title than miss the playoffs entirely. Almost half of our seasons have ended in June, at the NBA Finals; this year, our season could end in April. We’re spoiled by success. And that success is fuelled by a franchise that has consistently made the right moves at the right time. There were the aggressive trades that brought in Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Pau Gasol. The inspired drafts of Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Magic Johnson. The signing of free agent Shaquille O’Neal. And then there was the time the Lakers took a chance on a skinny 17 year-old who came to the NBA straight out of high school: Kobe Bryant. That is why, when I worry about my Lakers, rival fans show absolutely no sympathy. The Lakers, they sigh, always find a way to win. Except, this time, I don’t really see one. Not an easy one, anyway. What can the Lakers do? Standard practice when a team in any sport is struggling is, of course, to fire the coach. But the Lakers already did that: Mike Brown was fired just five games into the season and replaced with Mike D’Antoni. How about a big trade? For months now, there has been talk of Pau Gasol moving on. But that suggests someone else wants Gasol badly enough to offer someone valuable in exchange. And as much as I love Pau Gasol (and I do), I struggle to see who would want an expensive 32 year-old who has declined in virtually every major statistical category this season. No, nobody’s coming to save this team, no magic trade, no clever coaching change. This mess needs to be resolved on the court. They will somehow need to find a way to win, and win now. The Lakers cannot afford to waste time. I do mean that literally: This line-up is too expensive to keep together. And this team is old. Kobe is in his 17th season. Steve Nash will be 39 next month. There’s also no guarantee Dwight Howard will still be a Laker next year. Howard is a free agent after this season. It was widely assumed that he would sign a new deal with the Lakers and become the leader of the franchise when Kobe retires in the next few seasons. But given the mess the Lakers are currently in, could you blame Howard for finding a better situation? When Howard joined the Lakers in the summer, we thought we had a team that was ready to make history. Sadly, we were right: In over sixty years as an NBA franchise, the Lakers have missed the playoffs just five times. This could be the year we make it six.",Raw Data
514,"Every night is a test in the NBA, every game in its own way a different challenge, and the Pistons this week get to measure themselves against two teams I would put in the NBA’s final four, as they say in college. Our great fans got to see San Antonio, with the best record in the league, play at The Palace on Tuesday night and next up at home, on Friday, come the Miami Heat. Give me those two teams, plus the Lakers from the West and the Celtics from the East, and I think the NBA champion is probably coming from that group. That doesn’t rule out a few other teams, of course, but I was very impressed with the Spurs. I was also struck by what Gregg Popovich said after the game at The Palace. He said just because the Spurs have the NBA’s best record doesn’t mean they’re the NBA’s best them. They still have some areas they need to improve, especially on defense. But that guy can coach with anybody. People who say maybe the Spurs don’t have quite enough players, or Tim Duncan isn’t quite what he used to be – they’re a great team. They’re the definition of a team, in many ways like the Pistons in the Goin’ to Work days when they won one championship and were minutes away from another one against those very Spurs. The Spurs have been there, they’ve won multiple titles and I think they’ll be very difficult to beat again this postseason. Then there’s the Lakers. I know they don’t have a very good record this season against upper-echelon teams, I know they’ve struggled. But when it comes to coaching, I wouldn’t bet against Phil Jackson having them ready come playoff time. The West is going to be very intriguing. I know I haven’t mentioned Dallas. I guess I’m still not sure about them. Just about the time you think they’ve hit the wall and they’re on a losing streak, you look back and see they still have the second-best record in the West. It would be an insult to call them a darkhorse, but I still put them No. 3 in the West. How do you go against the defending champs and how do you go against the team with the best record in the league? I’m excited to see Miami coming in on Friday. We’ve seen them twice at Miami, of course, but I’m excited for our fans to get a chance to see them for the first time at The Palace. It was hard to envision what the Heat were going to be at the beginning of the year. You keep thinking they have the big three and then role players. And, yes, they do have role players, but I wouldn’t call somebody like Zydrunas Ilgauskas a role player. He doesn’t get the same amount of minutes and shots he used to, but he’s a player. And Eddie House might have a role, but he’s not just another guy. He’s made big shots all his life and he’ll make some more. Udonis Haslem will be back and he’s probably the X factor on that team. By the time he comes back and he’s healthy and in some kind of groove, it could be almost playoff time. If you’re used to playing against Miami, you’ll have to turn the page when you play against the Heat with Udonis Haslem. He’s one of the most underrated players in the game. Then you come to the Boston Celtics, who without the injury to Kendrick Perkins, I believe, would have won another NBA title last summer. As good as the Lakers were, even without Perkins the Celtics were ahead late in Game 7 at LA. Their big man is back, the big three don’t seem to have lost anything and Rajon Rondo is better than ever. They have a winning mentality. Some of it comes with putting on a Celtics uniform. Some of it comes from the big three already winning a title and coming close again last year. These Celtics are going to be very tough to knock out of the playoffs. I see two other threats in the East. You can’t go to sleep on Orlando and nobody will, but if somebody doesn’t take the Chicago Bulls as seriously as they should, they’ll be watching the rest of the playoffs. The Bulls are good and Derrick Rose, I believe, is already a superstar. So there are some great teams out there and I’m glad we got to see the Spurs up close and personal. You try to figure out why a team is 43 and 8 – sometimes you’ve got to see them in person, not just on TV. And I was as impressed with the Spurs as I thought I would be. Now we’ll get to see the Heat. Our fans are in for a treat. Whether you like ’em or hate ’em, they’re for real. And Erik Spoelstra has done a very good job with that team. He has a good staff – Ron Rothstein, the old Pistons assistant from Chuck Daly’s staff who took over as head coach, is one of the best – and he’s got that team in a groove. It should be a great night at The Palace.",Raw Data

516,"The 29-year-old, winner in 2008 and 2010, claimed a 10-6 victory over defending champion Neil Robertson at Alexandra Palace in London to add the Masters title and the £175,000 first prize to last month's UK Championship crown. ""It's just unbelievable at the moment,"" Selby said. ""At one stage I didn't know whether I was going to be playing again and now I'm sitting here after winning the UK Championship in December and the Masters in January. ""The majority of the match I was really happy with the way I played. ""Going into today's game I knew I had to play a lot better and score better and be a lot more attacking. ""I seemed to do that in the first session, to go 5-1 in front. Neil showed what a class player he is to come back to 5-3. ""Tonight it was the same again, how I started off this morning. I'm really happy."" In the best-of-19 final, Australian top-seed Robertson responded from 8-3 down by taking three successive frames. World number one Selby, though, was able to hold off the fightback and see out victory to join five others who had won the tournament three times or more. The Jester from Leicester joined Cliff Thorburn, Stephen Hendry, Paul Hunter, Steve Davis and Ronnie O'Sullivan, whose presence on semi-final day ignited whispers of him launching a world title defence later this year. After his £125,000 win in York in December, Selby became the first to win back-to-back majors since Mark Williams 10 years ago. The midnight finish came after a late night with a 6-5 semi-final defeat of Graeme Dott. Selby, whose only century break of the tournament came in the third frame of the final, added: ""This afternoon I felt great, I felt fresh. Tonight I felt it catching up with me, but thankfully I gave myself a good enough lead to have something to mess about with. ""To come back to 8-6 he was more or less back in the game and the next frame was huge, 8-7 or 9-6 and I managed to nick it and fall over the line, really."" Selby will now target his first World Championship title at the Crucible in May. He said: ""I'll go there trying my best to achieve it. There's a lot of great players out there. ""It's going to be tough, but it's still a long way away yet."" Only three players had successfully defended the Masters title, and Robertson was unable to emulate Thorburn, Hendry and Hunter. Cambridge-based Robertson made six centuries en route to the final, where his positional play let him down. ""It was always going to be hard to keep up that kind of form,"" Robertson said. ""My positional play, which has been fantastic all week, was really, really poor in the first session. ""To come out of it 5-3 I was absolutely over the moon. ""Tonight I was much better, but the run of the ball was a little bit unkind at times. ""At 8-6 I had him a bit in trouble with a safety shot, he fluked a red, with four or five open reds. If the red hadn't gone in I had a good chance to go 8-7. ""It just wasn't meant to be today.""",Raw Data

518,"If Michigan fans want to thank anyone for their new, shiny No. 1 ranking no trophies or banners quite yet they could start with Glenn Robinson III. On the same day that the Wolverines claimed the top spot in The Associated Press poll for the first time since 1992, Robinson was chosen the Big Ten Freshman of the Week for the second straight week. The Wolverines advanced from No. 2 to take the No. 1 spot for the fourth time. They were there for 10 weeks in 1964-65, eight weeks in 1976-77 and three weeks at the start of 1992-93, the Fab Five's second and final season together. That season, Chris Webber, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson made it to the national championship game for the second straight year. Jackson now lives in Texas, but he roots for the Wolverines from afar. ''I'm excited about it and I'm very proud of those boys,'' Jackson said in a telephone interview Monday. ''I'm really excited and pleased about what Coach (John) Beilein has done to turn the program around.'' Robinson averaged 12 points and eight rebounds in Michigan's wins over Purdue and Illinois, playing 75 of a possible 80 minutes. Robinson, who also has earned praise for his defensive skills, is averaging 12.1 points and 6.0 rebounds in 20 games, playing more than 30 minutes a game. The Wolverines have won six Big Ten Freshman of the Week awards this season three by Nik Stauskas, two by Robinson and one by Mitch McGary. Last year, Michigan won seven, all by Trey Burke. With No. 1 Duke getting routed at Miami, the Wolverines cleared the path to the top ranking with double-digit victories over the Boilermakers and Illini. After that, it was just a nervous wait for the fans, because Beilein and the players rightly claim not to care for the AP poll to be released on Monday. The poll finally came out in the early afternoon, and Michigan indeed moved into first place, picking up 51 of the 65 first-place votes. No. 2 Kansas, which remains No. 1 in the coaches poll, had 13 first-place votes, while No. 4 Florida picked up the final vote. Indiana is No. 3, while Duke fell to No. 5. The Wolverines will make the first defense of their new ranking on Wednesday, when they host Northwestern. Then, Michigan faces a serious test on Saturday night at Indiana. ''Our goal at Michigan is to be No. 1 in the Big Ten. When you achieve that honor, you will have a chance at the national championship,'' Beilein said. ''All through the year polls will spark great interest among college basketball fans everywhere and that is always good. Our coaches and players, however, will remain focused on our goals of improving daily and competing for the championship within our conference.'' Michigan State remained at No. 13 after its 75-70 loss Sunday at Indiana.",Raw Data
519,"Richard Evans has covered tennis since the 1960s, reporting on more than 150 Grand Slams. He is author of 15 books, including the official history of the Davis Cup and the unofficial history of the modern game in ""Open Tennis."" He lives in Florida. Andre Agassi thinks his own fall from grace with the use of recreational drugs may have helped tennis protect itself by calling in the outside governance of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Speaking at Melbourne Park on Friday while touring to promote an autobiography, Agassi said, “I think that tennis has always led the way [in drug testing]. I really believe that. For their own reasons I might have played a part in it, for them going to WADA and the governance that has no horse in the race. That, to me, is a great thing.” Then Agassi turned the focus back to himself, and his use of drugs during his playing days — the most talked-about portion of his book. “For me, it would have kept me from destroying a few years of my life. That’s what I did to myself with the use of the recreational destructive substance of crystal meth. It would have saved me on a lot of fronts. The more testing, the better as far as I am concerned. The stricter, the better; the more transparency, the better, the more accountability, the better.” Agassi said it has been hard for him to stomach the revelations of Lance Armstrong. “Sadness, disappointment, I think ‘anger’ is a fair word,'' he said. ""I was certainly one of those who flat-out believed him over that long period of time. The thought of it not being the case was unconscionable to me.” Agassi also talked about how the game has evolved. “I marvel at it all,” said the man who won four Aussie Open titles, collected eight Grand Slams in all and achieved the career Slam. “My whole game was based on playing with that sense of urgency and to force guys to be ballistic out there, to treat a marathon like a sprint,'' he said. ""I benefited from raising the stakes. I had more or less four hours in me before I knew I was running on borrowed time, physically. That’s four hours of me running other people, you know. “So to watch them do it, they’re more calculated now. They play slower, so six hours is not the same six hours that I played. But these guys like [Novak] Djokovic and [Andy] Murray, they’re much better athletes. They also appear to be stronger in the lower body than I was; in the upper body, not so much. But my game was never about using my legs as much as they do.” Agassi said he relied on getting an opponent behind in a point and “slowly smothering them.” He went on, “But now nobody’s behind in a point. You never know when they’re behind. That would have eliminated any ability I had to move forward in the court. That means I would have had to have been a different player. It means the game has gotten a lot better.”",Raw Data
520,"NEW YORK Gregg Popovich has been around the game of basketball and his San Antonio Spurs team long enough to know when he has seen enough, and after three quarters of the Spurs' 100-83 loss to the New York Knicks on Thursday night well, suffice it to say he had seen all he needed to see. Popovich pulled stars Tim Duncan and Tony Parker with 3:02 left in the third quarter of what was a seven-point game against a Knicks team battling for first place in the Eastern Conference. And as New York's lead ballooned to 17 within the first two minutes of the fourth quarter and then 25 later in the frame the NBA's most perverse coach never gave much consideration to putting them back in. The Spurs (26-9), playing their fourth game in five nights, saw their seven-game win streak end in front of a sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden, but it didn't much matter, just like most individual wins and losses don't matter for the league's least fascinating, but most frustratingly consistent team. After making 15 consecutive playoff appearances and winning four NBA championships since selecting the big man Duncan first overall in the 1997 draft, this is a franchise that has learned to play for May and June and has never put too much stock in what happens on random Thursday nights in January. And given those accomplishments, all under Popovich, who are we to question their methods? ""I could see it wasn't going to happen,"" Popovich said of the decision to phone it in against the Knicks, who shot 54.5 percent in the second half and made 12 3-pointers on the night. ""We were too low on fuel and their defense was too good a bad combination. And then they made shots, which makes it even worse. Toward the middle or end of the third quarter, they started knocking them down, and that was that."" All told, Duncan, who is having an exceptional bounceback season at age 36, played 24 minutes and followed up his monster game in Wednesday night's win in Milwaukee with an unexceptional 11 points and six rebounds. Parker contributed 11 points and six assists in the same amount of time. Reserve guard Manu Ginobili played exactly two seconds more than Duncan and Parker and added eight points on just 2-of-10 shooting. It could be argued that Popovich willingly gave away a winnable game by sitting his stars late and maybe he did. But really, we should consider ourselves lucky that Popovich even played them at all, especially considering what happened last time San Antonio visited an East power in the final game of a four-games-in-five-nights stretch. On Nov. 29, Popovich defiantly sent Duncan, Parker and Ginobili home before the final game of a nine-day, six-game road trip that concluded with a nationally televised game in Miami. The league ended up fining the Spurs $250,000 for ""resting players in a manner contrary to the best interests of the NBA,"" but even now it doesn't sound like a decision Popovich regrets making. Before Thursday's loss, Popovich revisited the choice to concede the Heat game which they really didn't concede at all, and nearly won despite having a skeleton crew and contrasted it to Thursday's game, which came on the heels of wins over the Mavericks, Nets and Bucks in four days leading up to it. ""This one, everyone is pretty healthy and we've had time, so it's a little bit different circumstance,"" Popovich said when asked if his stars would be playing. ""But it's not about rest. It's about health and it's about safety. Rest comes into it a little bit more toward the end. For us, being a little older in the beginning of the year, it's about doing what we have to do so that they're there at the end of the season. That's the main thing."" The palpable lack of concern over Thursday's result was almost comical in the San Antonio locker room after the game. You haven't seen a team not give a damn about a loss until you've seen the Spurs not give a damn about a loss, and, as expected, San Antonio dismissed the defeat as little more than one of 20 to 30 losses the Spurs will absorb this season. The Spurs players were a ""nobody expects to go 82-0"" away from using every post-loss clich in the book. ""It's a long season, it's a lot of games,"" Duncan said. ""You're going to win some, you're going to lose some. We feel pretty good about ourselves right now; I think we're playing pretty well. We dropped a game, but we won three out of four on four in five nights. That's a pretty decent go at it, so we'll take it and move onto the next one."" When asked what his team needed to do to turn things around when it takes the floor for its next game, Saturday at home against Philadelphia, Duncan doubled up on his distant, almost blithe demeanor. ""Turn what around?"" he asked, in a way that didn't sound nearly as pretentious as it reads. ""We lost a game it's the middle of the season, it happens. We just won [seven] in a row and lost a game. I think we'll be all right."" After winning a league-best 50 games in last year's condensed, post-lockout regular season, the Spurs ran out of steam against a younger, more energetic Oklahoma City team in the Western Conference finals. Thursday's loss dropped San Antonio to third in the West, behind the Thunder and the Los Angeles Clippers only by percentage points. Should the Spurs get another shot at yet another title in a Duncan era that has been nothing if not uniform, the Spurs don't want fatigue to be their downfall and they don't care how flippant they sound about it. It might not always be the most popular approach, but when it comes to the Spurs, and particularly Popovich, the only thing that matters is the endgame, and little else not opponents, not winning streaks, not national TV broadcasts or playing till the final whistle and certainly not hefty fines carries any weight. ""It's a long season,"" Popovich said during a postgame news conference that was so somber it started with a fiscal cliff joke. ""(We have a) game on Saturday, that's the one that matters now whoever it is.""",Raw Data
521,"No one is more central to the future of the Pistons than Andre Drummond. They hope Jose Calderon becomes a part of that future, as well. But Calderon hits free agency when the season ends and theres no guarantee that one component critical to his evaluation process how he meshes with Andre Drummond will have entered anything into evidence for him when he weighs all factors. It would be great, for sure, Calderon told me before the Pistons headed out on a weeklong Western Conference road swing. It was great, the way he was playing and the way he was playing the pick and roll and thats what I do. Id love to have time to play with him, for sure. It could be fun, but the more important thing is for him to get fully healthy and ready. When hes ready, hell be back. If its 10 games, good. If its three, good. Whatever it is will be is OK. Drummond has missed the last 14 games with a stress fracture in the fifth lumbar vertabra. The initial timetable given for his return was four to six weeks. There have been no setbacks in his recovery, but logic dictates that the Pistons are going to err on the side of caution twice over where Drummond is concerned. The worst case would be to come back too soon and suffer a setback that wipes out a good chunk of Drummonds off-season program, a time when the Pistons hope they can really accelerate his growth. Calderon plans to return to Spain after the season, as he always does, where both he and his wifes families live in close proximity. A loyal participant with the Spanish national team, Calderon hopes to play again with the Gasol brothers and the world powers other regulars in Eurobasket competition in August. But, he says, his free-agent status clouds his summer participation this year. Thats why I cant say yes to the national team right now, because I dont know whats going to happen, he said. Well see. These things always take time. I dont like to think too much ahead. Calderon is non-committal about his vision for free agency, but its clear he is fitting in seamlessly with the Pistons. Longtime Pistons staffers say they see in Calderon the team-bonding initiatives that they saw from Chauncey Billups. He organized a team dinner when the Pistons had an off-day in Indianapolis last month and says hes looking forward to the West Coast swing for similar opportunities. It also isnt lost on Calderon that the Pistons acquired him not for his expiring contract, but to give them the home-team advantages in re-signing him and nearly three months to sell themselves to him. The good thing, when the trade was done, they want me here that makes a big difference, Calderon said. I feel like Im wanted. Im really comfortable, the way its been, and when July arrives, well talk and see what happens. Its not like, I throw you, Jose Calderon, in a trade because you make it work. They went into the trade to get me and theyve tried to get me for a while, so its really nice. Calderon is averaging 7.6 assists and 1.7 turnovers in 16 games since joining the Pistons, numbers that are in line with his career averages of 7.2 and 1.7. But those numbers might get even better as his familiarity with the Pistons and theirs with him grows or when Drummond gets back to finish lobs. Over the last five games, Calderon is averaging 10.8 assists and 1.4 turnovers. It was about (the benefit of) time, he said. There are going to be games, maybe, I cant get a lot, but still I think were playing better together. Its about practice time, games, chemistry. Its about knowing where they can get the ball. Its familiarity, for sure. Im happy everybody is comfortable with me out there. The bad thing is we didnt finish those games with a win, but I think were getting better. I think weve got a lot of good things we can do. Brian Hill, standing in for Pistons coach Lawrence Frank while he stays at his wifes side during her illness, said Calderon has fit into the offense more than the offense has been tailored for Calderon. It really hasnt been tweaked that much, he said. I think its just the mind-set of the player. Where Brandon (Knight) has a little bit of a scorers mentality, Jose has a little bit more of a setup mentality. He has a very good understanding of the play, of how defenses have to cover the play and who might be open in a given situation. I just think its his background, having been a point guard his whole life and all the experience he has both at the professional and international levels. Thats who he is. Hes a guy who reads defenses extremely well and knows where the open man is going to be. Calderon says the major difference between the offense he runs with the Pistons and the offense he operated in Toronto is the focus the big men, Greg Monroe and Drummond, for the Pistons, and the wings, DeMar DeRozan and, now, Rudy Gay with Toronto. Here, we go more into the bigs because weve got Moose and Dre, when he was there, and we run a lot through them. Now weve got B Knight at the two and he can do a lot of things. With Greg now and with B Knight at the two, we mix it up a little more, but before that I think the offense was more focused on Greg and the big guys it started in and out. Calderon played sporadically along with Kyle Lowry this season in Toronto, but hes accustomed to being the sole ballhandler and distributor. Its different, he said, playing alongside Knight and two other players with point guard on their resumes, Rodney Stuckey and Will Bynum. But one of the reasons Calderon has proven himself a joy to coach is that he embraces the differences and tries to figure out how best to exploit the personnel around him, whatever its configuration, to the teams best advantage. Ive got no problems, he said. Sometimes if you are hitting shots or you are shooting the three well, you can have B Knight or Stuck or Will handle the ball. Its another shooter you can put out there, so Im comfortable that way. At the end of the day, its about being a guard. You dont have to be just a point guard or just a two. The good thing about this team is we can mix that a little bit. In the five days between the trades completion and Calderons clearance to play once visa issues were resolved, Frank and the coaching staff forged a vision of how Calderon would fit and theyre now seeing it come to life. It was always to be a facilitator first and then, if there was the opportunity to score, that second. But hes a much better shooter than people give him credit for, Hill said. Im surprised when he has open jump shots if he doesnt knock them down. But the primary vision that L had, I think, was a guy to make our offense that much more efficient and effective and to be a facilitator for the other four guys on the floor. Thats a vision Joe Dumars will do his best to convince Calderon should be extended beyond the seasons final 18 games.",Raw Data
522,"Markov was at the edge of the crease and lifted the rebound of Rene Bourque's shot off the end boards into an open side for his fourth goal. The Canadiens went on the man advantage after Andy Greene took down Erik Cole at 4:01. Brendan Gallagher scored his first NHL goal and linemate Brandon Prust got his first with the Canadiens. Ryan White also scored for Montreal. ''We played against a good hockey team that hadn't lost and that went to the Stanley Cup final last season, so it was a good measuring stick for us,'' said Montreal coach Michel Therrien. ''We showed a lot of resilience.'' The Canadiens took a 3-1 lead early in the third period, but David Clarkson scored on a power play and Dainius Zubrus tied the game at 13:02. Patrick Elias scored and had two assists to reach 900 career points. ''Considering we didn't play 60 minutes ... we'll take the point,'' Devils coach Peter DeBoer said. ''And, thank Marty Brodeur.'' The Canadiens posted a rare win over veteran goalie Brodeur, who is 43-19-5 against Montreal in his career. Montreal had a 32-25 shots advantage, including 16-7 in the opening period when they took a 2-0 lead. The Canadiens were first on the puck from the outset and scored 2:25 into the game when Alexei Emelin's shot was tipped by Travis Moen and went off Brodeur to White for his first of the season. Emelin flipped the puck to the far blue line where Greene lost it to Galchenyuk, who slipped a pass into the slot for the onrushing Gallagher to fire into an open side at 13:35. It was a first goal in three NHL games for the 20-year-old. ''To get that first one is something you remember,'' Gallagher said. ''Alex made a great pass. He looked off the D-man and put it right where it had to be. I just had to put it on the net.'' The roles reversed in the second period as New Jersey camped out in Montreal's end and got a goal at 3:26 when Elias tipped a Mark Fayne pint shot past Carey Price after some strong work in the corner by Clarkson. Galchenyuk intercepted a clearing attempt and slipped the puck ahead to Prust to bat in two minutes into the third period. ''We've got to keep doing the same thing - keeping it simple out there, moving pucks and hunting down pucks,'' Prust said. ''That's what made us successful.'' But Galchenyuk and Prust were both off for high-sticking when Clarkson banged in an Elias feed during a two-man advantage at 5:23. Zubrus tied it at 13:02 on a feed from behind the net by Elias. Notes: Montreal was without left winger Max Pacioretty, who was released from hospital Sunday after an appendectomy. He will be out 3-4 weeks. Lars Eller moved into his spot. . .

524,"With James producing at a record-setting clip that no one had ever reached, just as Jordan’s 50th birthday approaches this weekend, classifying James’ place in NBA history couldn’t be a hotter topic. James wants no part of it, tweeting that he’s “not MJ.” And his peers say it’s time to back off all the comparisons. “It’s simple. There will never be another Michael Jordan,” said Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade, who grew up in Chicago watching Jordan’s games. “He was the first to do a lot of things. Whenever you’re the first, there can never be another. “But you know what? That guy down there [James], he’s in the beginning of starting his own path. There will be someone who will be compared to the next Lebron James, but there will never be another one of him. Certain guys are that special and that unique.” James’ NBA record six-game streak of at least 30 points while shooting 60 percent or better ended Thursday against Oklahoma City when he scored 39 points and shot 58 percent in the Heat’s 110-100 win. Doing something that even Jordan never did on his way to six NBA titles made James the buzz of the league heading into All-Star weekend. But it wasn’t the most important thing to James. “It didn’t bother me during the game or not, if I was shooting 60 percent or not,” James said. “I just go out and play my game, and that was the result of it. It didn’t bother me and it didn’t matter if I got it tonight or not. ... To win is what it’s all about.” And just because LeBron is adding to his own lore doesn’t mean it has to come at the expense of Jordan’s greatness. “I think those two guys are different,” three-time scoring champion Kevin Durant said. “LeBron’s a once-in-a-lifetime type of player. I think people really were waiting for him to win the championship to compare, just like any other great player. ... It’s not a knock on LeBron or taking anything from him, because the stuff he’s done is unreal as well, but it’s kind of hard to compare anybody to Michael Jordan.” James started his NBA career wearing Jordan’s No. 23, but switched to 6 later and suggested that no one in the league should wear 23 again out of tribute to Jordan. The plan never stuck. And while establishing his own identity, James still finds himself dodging Jordan’s impressive shadow. “You can’t compare guys until both guys are finished playing,” Durant said. “You’ll see when Kobe Bryant’s done playing how you can compare him to Michael, Magic Johnson and LeBron, stuff like that. But while they’re playing, I don’t think you can really compare them.” This stretch of proficiency is just another phase in James’ ascent. Where he’ll end up, whether he’ll ever approach all those titles James, Wade and Chris Bosh predicted when they joined in Miami, is still to be determined. “Every year, he’s come back a better player for 10 years now. That’s remarkable in itself. Not a lot of guys can say that. I’m not so sure he’s at his peak, which is frightening,” said Oklahoma City coach Scott Brooks, a Jordan contemporary. “What he is able to do at the level that he does it on both ends of the floor, you usually don’t see. You don’t see it often.” Jordan, although he hadn’t been in the league as long after playing at university, was 28 when he won his first championship in 1991. James had just turned 28, and Wade cautioned that he was still only starting his own, unique story. “MJ’s legacy at 50 years old is still going strong,” Wade said, “and Lebron James’ legacy will be the same.”",Raw Data

526,"With 29 regular-season games remaining and the playoffs still in sight, Kobe Bryant is more determined than ever to prove he and the Lakers can become the force they thought they were. Whether center Dwight Howard is a part of that attempted revival doesn't matter to Bryant, sources familiar with Bryant's thinking told FOX Sports Ohio. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak has strongly nixed the notion that Howard could be moved prior to Thursday's trading deadline. But if Kupchak changes his mind, he'd have Bryant's full support, according to sources. While Bryant and Howard aren't close, no rift exists between them, either. Still, Bryant appears uncertain if Howard is the right fit on a team that must put together a fervent finish just to qualify for the postseason -- and one that is unlikely to possess home-court advantage in any round if it does get there. The Lakers exited the All-Star break at an underachieving 25-29 and 3 games out of the final playoff spot. Optimists will point to the fact they've won eight of their previous 12 games. But they lost 125-101 to the Clippers on the final night before All-Star weekend -- in a game that resembled little more than 48 minutes of garbage time. The acquisitions of Howard and point guard Steve Nash prior to the season immediately made the Lakers the popular favorite to win the Western Conference. They were considered a sure title contender, boasting a lineup that could greatly assist the 34-year-old Bryant in his quest to obtain a sixth championship ring. Instead, the Lakers started slowly, fired coach Mike Brown after five games, replaced Brown with Mike D'Antoni, and have continued to look out of sorts. Howard alone can hardly be blamed, and Bryant even admires how Howard has played through back and shoulder pain. But sources say Bryant also wonders if Howard has the right approach, mental toughness and overall willingness to help the Lakers flourish in what has become their most important stretch. Bryant is not alone in his concern, sources say. Nash, Pau Gasol and several others also seem fairly uneasy about Howard's commitment to the cause. According to sources, a number of Lakers have their doubts about whether Howard takes the game seriously and ""wants it"" enough for the challenges the team now faces. Howard's $19.2 million contract is second-highest on the Lakers (behind Bryant) and expires at the end of the season. It is believed he too would be OK with a trade, and likely welcome one if he were sent to a preferred destination. Brooklyn and Dallas are said to be among the teams with which Howard would agree to a contract extension this summer. Sources insist it's still possible Howard could re-sign with the Lakers, but that he hasn't made up his mind and won't come to such a decision until the season plays out. Kupchak has denied a CBS Sports report the Lakers were toying with the idea of trading Howard to the Celtics in a deal for point guard Rajon Rondo, out for the season with an ACL injury. However, sources say Kupchak has indeed taken several calls centered on Howard. So far, according to sources, Kupchak has quickly shot down any pitches.",Raw Data
527,"West can sign with any NBA team while with the Legends, who play in the Dallas suburb of Frisco. The Legends acquired him because they were next in line to pick up players from the D-League player pool when West joined it. Part of West's value a year ago came from being a younger, experienced player to help point guard Jason Kidd and Jason Terry. The Mavericks now have a much younger backcourt in Darren Collison and O.J. Mayo. West, a first-round pick by Boston in the 2004 NBA Draft, averaged 9.7 points and 3.6 assists per game for his career, which also included stops in Cleveland and Dallas. West helped his team to the postseason in six of his eight seasons in the NBA. The Texas Legends, with the addition of West, currently have five former first-round picks on the roster, and West also makes the seventh player on the current roster with NBA experience (Justin Dentmon, Melvin Ely, Luther Head, Rashad McCants, Sean Singletary, Delonte West and Sean Williams).",Raw Data
528,"After watching Jordan Crawford go on the road and finish off the Trail Blazers earlier this week on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, DeMar Derozan repeated the act across country in Orlando. And like one of his predecessors (J.R. Smith), he took a liking to that left baseline corner, rising and fading over two defenders right in front of the Magic’s bench to finish off a stellar period. D-Roz’s shot didn’t happen in a vacuum. It culminated a frenzied night for both teams, with 12 lead changes and a lot of players getting in on the action (12 players notched double figures in scoring). The Raptors had been in a string of close games (overtime in three of previous four matchups) and had no intention of carrying this game past the regulation mark. For those that are new around these parts, the Horry scale examines a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety Kings-Pistons game?) and celebration (is it over the top or too chill? Just the right panache or needs more sauce?). Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, the patron saint of last-second daggers. How does DeRozan’s shot Thursday night stack up? Without further ado… DeRozan likes the mid-range area, shooting over 100 more shots there than the paint (his next favorite spot). Even still, this was a nice shot. The high jumper safely made it through the bucket only after the Compton native took a pass from Jose Calderon, a couple dribbles to his left and launched with two defenders in hot pursuit. Glen Davis was just a shade too late, allowing a sliver of daylight to a hot shooter (more on this later) at the wrong time of the game. This was evocative of the kind of shot Kobe Bryant makes on a regular basis. Game Situation Again, this was a back-and-forth affair. With under a minute left, DeRozan put the Raptors ahead with a jumper after J.J. Redick completed a four-point play. E’Twaun Moore scored two off an offensive rebound, tying the game, setting up the final shot with the score tied at 95 with 4.3 seconds to go. A cursory glance says “this was just two bottom-rung teams slugging it out.” Which is true (both teams are a combined 30-56). However, for DeRozan, this was significant. For a player looking to establish himself as a 2-guard to watch, closing a game out like this is a good route to take. He had only eight points going into the fourth quarter, then erupted for 14 (7-of-8, six jumpers). What happened? Well for one, Orlando went small. For a player who eats off mid-range jumpers and getting into the paint, this is a boon. Consequently, he got hot, obviating the Raptors’ blown double-digit lead and botched defensive coverages (including the aforementioned four-point play by Redick). Thanks to his heroics, the Raptors made a step toward closing games out, which has been their Achilles’ heel this season. Oh and also worth noting? According to “Inside the NBA” stats maven Joe “Underdog” Underhill, DeRozan’s shot was the first Raptors buzzer-beater since T.J. Ford sank the Clippers way back on Dec. 20, 2006 with a jumper over Quinton Ross. That’s more than seven years since Toronto has hopped on the Horry! For the Magic, chalk this up to another lesson for a young team still learning how to win in this league. No jumping. No yelling. No smiling. Just a couple arms in the air and plain grit on the face of D-Roz as teammates Amir Johnson and Calderon came for the man-hugs. The dejected body languages on Redick and Jameer Nelson told the tale as much as the Raptors’ celebration. The Raptors looked more relieved at not losing in Orlando than thrilled at ending the game in such a dramatic fashion. Coach Dwane Casey isn’t prone to histrionics. Neither is his team. But Alan Anderson’s ball spike after the shot fell through was top notch. *Editor’s note: Prior to DeRozan’s post-game interview, Casey did run up to give DeRozan a good smooch on the cheek. Must say, this ratchets the celebration factor up a bit. 3 Horrys. I suppose the shot could’ve been harder, if there were three defenders on him. Only two knocks on the rating: the tie game and subdued celebration (minus the kiss from coach). I’m all for a little grit. But you sent the opposing crowd home bitter right as time expired. Live it up a little. Either way, an incredible shot to end a superb fourth quarter for DeRozan. What sayeth you? You can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.",Raw Data
529,"Payton's season-long suspension for his role in the Saints' bounty program was lifted by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday, nearly two weeks earlier than expected. The decision allows Payton to attend the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala., on Saturday, where some of the top college players available for the NFL draft will be competing. Payton, along with assistant head coach Joe Vitt, general manager Mickey Loomis, and four players including Jonathan Vilma, was suspended after an investigation found the club had a performance pool offering cash rewards for key plays, including big hits. The player suspensions eventually were overturned. ''I clearly recognize that mistakes were made, which led to league violations,'' Payton said in a statement. ''Furthermore, I have assured the commissioner a more diligent protocol will be followed.'' The suspension was scheduled to end after the Super Bowl on Feb. 3, but was moved up after Payton and Goodell met on Monday. ''Coach Payton acknowledged in the meeting his responsibility for the actions of his coaching staff and players and pledged to uphold the highest standards of the NFL and ensure that his staff and players do so as well,'' Goodell said in a statement. `''Sean fully complied with all the requirements imposed on him during his suspension. ''More important, it is clear that Sean understands and accepts his responsibilities as a head coach and the vital role that coaches play in promoting player safety and setting an example for how the game should be played at all levels.'' Saints owner Tom Benson welcomed back his coach. ''We are all thankful that Sean Payton has been reinstated,'' Benson said. ''We have a lot of work to do and we are in the middle of it right now.'' Payton also needs to fill a key position on his coaching staff following the departure last week of offensive line coach and running game coordinator Aaron Kromer, now the offensive coordinator in Chicago. Loomis and Vitt are in Mobile evaluating players. Loomis said he was caught off guard by the news of Payton's return. But he said having Payton back sooner than expected will help the Saints. ''Every day makes a difference. We've certainly missed Sean in terms of the football team and all the things that go with our business and the game. But look, I miss his friendship. We all miss his friendship. We miss him as a person. I'm excited that he's going to be back here and fired up that he's back.'' Vitt said he talked to Payton Tuesday morning and that he should join the Saints' contingent in Alabama on Wednesday. ''We just found out on the way to practice,'' Vitt said. ''Mr. B called Mickey and we're all excited. Sean went and spent the day in New York (Monday). He just got back in Dallas. I talked to him on the phone about 5 o'clock this morning. He's packing his bags so we'll expect he'll be here some time'' Wednesday. Vitt agreed with Loomis that the timing of Payton's return is good for the team. Payton is ''going to hit the ground running with both feet. His jaw is going to be set. He'll have a note pad full of thoughts and ideas and he's going to have to get himself caught up with the evaluation process of our team and looking at film, which he'll do. This is perfect, getting him back now, because he's going to be here for the readings of our players. He's going to be here for the readings of these college seniors. We start handing out unrestricted free agent tape on Thursday and Friday of this week. ''This is where you're building the foundation of your football team, with the evaluation process of these draft eligible juniors and seniors and the free agents that are out there.'' There remains one outstanding issue for the Saints stemming from the bounty probe: What will become of the Saints' second pick next spring. As part of the bounty punishment, Goodell fined the Saints $500,000 and took away second-round picks in 2012 and 2013. However, Goodell left open the possibility of restoring the 2013 second-rounder and instead docking the team a later-round pick if he is satisfied with the club's level of cooperation in the bounty matter. What the Saints do know is that the 49-year-old Payton is set to return to New Orleans for the next five seasons. Earlier this month he signed a contract extension running through the 2017 season. The coach is the last person punished in the bounty probe to return to work. Before Tuesday, Payton had not been at work since mid-April, when Goodell rejected the coach's appeal of his suspension. Loomis was suspended for eight games, Vitt for six and former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams remains suspended indefinitely Vilma and current Saints defensive lineman Will Smith, along with former Saints Scott Fujita and Anthony Hargrove, were given suspensions of various lengths, but never served a game. Their punishments were overturned after lengthy appeals which also coincided with exhaustive litigation in federal court. The litigation included Vilma's defamation lawsuit against Goodell, which was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan last week. Payton's reinstatement is one more step for the Saints to return to normalcy, but for Vitt, said it doesn't bring closure to the bounty scandal. ''It doesn't for me. You're going to have ask Sean that question, Mickey that question, Vilma that question. It certainly doesn't for me. I can forgive. I'm not going to forget. It is what it is.''",Raw Data

Don't worry - sign up anytime throughout the season and still be in with a chance to win weekly and monthly prizes! MK Dons produced a major shock in their fourth round FA Cup tie at QPR with a 4-2 win over their Premier League opponents. The League One side got off to a flying start with Armand Traore putting through his own net after just four minutes and Ryan Lowe doubled the lead five minutes before the break. Things got worse for QPR with Ryan Harley netting a third for MK Dons on 50 minutes and Darren Potter got in on the act six minutes later to pile the misery on Harry Redknapp's side. Jay Bothroyd and Fabio da Silva netted two late goals to reduce the arrears, but it could not spoil MK Dons' day. The hosts started the better in west London and found the back of the net after just 52 seconds, with Bothroyd setting up DJ Campbell to slot home. That strike was ruled out for offside and QPR's bright start was soon brought to an abrupt end when Shaun Williams' fourth-minute corner to the near post was put into his own goal by Traore under pressure from Dean Lewington. After that MK Dons were penned back and were reduced to hopeful efforts, with Dean Bowditch striking wide on a rare voyage forward, but QPR were made to pay for such generosity in front of goal five minutes from half-time. A long ball from Anthony Kay caught QPR, namely Anton Ferdinand, napping and Lowe slotted past Rob Green to double the Dons' advantage. Things got worse for QPR five minutes into the second half as MK Dons struck again as Lowe broke the offside trap and pulled back from the by-line for substitute Harley, who could not miss from close range. Dave Martin palmed over an Alejandro Faurlin header, before the Dons amazingly made it 4-0 in the 56th minute when Potter curled home past Green. In a bid to change things, Bobby Zamora came on for his first appearance since November 10. QPR captain Park Ji-sung was the man that made way and was jeered off the pitch by the home fans. Bothroyd nodded home in the 83rd minute after Zamora's tee-up, and Fabio scored in stoppage time from a Bothroyd touch, but it proved just a consolation on a terrible day in the Hoops' recent history. Rafael Benitez knows that at Chelsea, perhaps more than any other club, it is important to take things game-by-game.

For the most recent tournament, in 2009, the caps were set at 70, 85 and 100 pitches, respectively. Still, it’s not clear how many of the top American pitchers will participate. The United States roster will be announced Thursday, and stars Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw and Cole Hamels have yet to declare whether they intend to play. David Price and Matt Cain already have decided they won’t participate.

Hollywood is in love with America's pastime. See which movies about baseball hit a home run. • Mobile phones may be used for communication between the dugouts and bullpens, as will be the case for Major League Baseball games in 2013 through a partnership with T-Mobile. • Pool play will return to the round-robin format used in 2006. (The United States will play in Phoenix against Mexico, Italy and Canada.) • The WBC has adopted the same concussion protocol used in MLB: The game will be halted if a player has concussion-like symptoms, and the player will be evaluated immediately by a certified athletic trainer. • The paternity leave list may be used, for a minimum of one day and maximum of three. • Batting orders must be announced to the media at least 90 minutes before the first pitch. • The championship game will be played to completion.

Former All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest, Oceanside (Calif.) police told reporters outside his home Wednesday. “Mr. Seau has deceased,” Oceanside police chief Frank McCoy said during a news conference. “This case, at this point, is being investigated as a suicide, and a handgun was found by the body."" Police responded to Seau’s home after a woman who identified herself as his girlfriend alerted police around 9:30 a.m. PT. Emergency workers were unable to resuscitate Seau, who was found in a bedroom. Seau was 43. He played for three teams in his 20 NFL seasons — the San Diego Chargers (1990-2002), Miami Dolphins (2003-05) and New England Patriots (2006-09). ""Everyone at the Chargers is in complete shock and disbelief right now,” the Chargers organization said in a statement. “We ask everyone to stop what they're doing and send their prayers to Junior and his family."" Seau made headlines in October 2010 when he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and drove his car off a cliff in nearby Carlsbad after he was released from jail. Seau suffered minor injuries in the accident. He explained that he fell asleep at the wheel and the accident wasn’t a suicide attempt. It was an emotional scene outside Seau’s residence as friends and family members gathered. His mother, Luisa Seau, wept as she spoke to reporters. She appeared in disbelief that Seau would have killed himself. ”I don’t understand who did this to my son,” Luisa Seau said. “I pray to God, please take me. Take me! Leave my son, but it’s too late. It’s too late . . . I don’t know what I’m going to do. God give me the power.” Through tears, Louisa Seau mentioned she had spoken with her son as recently as Tuesday and he seemed OK. “My brother was a loving brother,” Junior Seau’s sister, Annette, told reporters as she asked for privacy as the family grieved. “He was a caring citizen.” Before the Chargers made him the No. 5 overall selection in the 1990 NFL Draft, Seau was an All-American at the University of Southern California. Those in the Trojans program were as shaken as many of his former NFL colleagues. ""This is a very sad day,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said in a statement. “The USC football program and the entire Trojan Family extends our condolences to Junior's family. He was one of the greatest Trojans of all time. Our team and fans were very fortunate to see him just a couple of weeks ago at our spring game at the (Los Angeles) Coliseum. He will be deeply missed."" The Patriots, where Seau ended his 20-season NFL career in 2009, said in a statement they were “shocked” about Wednesday’s developments. “We were fortunate to have had Junior join the Patriots in 2006 and are thankful for his many contributions to the team over the next four years,” the Patriots said. “He had a legendary NFL career, and his unrivaled passion for the game quickly made him a fan favorite here in New England. This is a sad day for the entire Patriots organization, our coaches and his many Patriots teammates. Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his many friends who will mourn this loss.” Chargers head coach Norv Turner worked with Seau in San Diego and Miami. ""I have no words to describe the passing of Junior Seau,"" Turner said. ""It is a sad, sad day not only for me but for the whole sports community. . . . I can tell you no one had more character and true leadership ability than Junior. He brought passion to the game of football that was unmatched. ""His commitment to charitable causes in the community was inspiring. It was an honor to know him. My thoughts and prayers are with his family."" Seau's death could lead to further discussion about the impact of concussions and other head trauma. The hard-charging linebacker was known more for giving concussions to the likes of Joe Montana, Boomer Esiason and other opponents during his career than incurring them. Seau didn’t appear to have a history of concussions, although players — especially in the era in which he played — were hesitant to report such injuries. Recent findings from head trauma researchers, however, have shown that repeated smaller impacts to the head can result in long-term damage. Several former NFL players have been diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease discovered by Boston University researchers from examining the brains of deceased athletes. Those who suffer from CTE — which currently can be diagnosed only postmortem — can suffer from depression, the loss of impulse control, memory loss and, in late stages, dementia. It’s not known whether Seau had agreed to donate his brain to Boston University, as a growing number of former athletes have done. It didn't appear Seau had joined the more than 1,200 players who are suing the NFL over head injuries. If his death is ruled a suicide, Seau would be the second former player in less than two weeks to kill himself. Former Atlanta Falcons defensive back Ray Easterling shot himself in his Richmond, Va., home on April 19. Easterling, 62, had suffered from depression and insomnia for years and was one of the first players to sue the league over concussions.",Raw Data
535,"﻿Rashad Evans paced circles around the silent locker room. Then the door opened, and he walked down a tunnel in the bowels of the United Center. A white towel covered his head. He stared at the cement floor, thinking of only this moment. He stopped near a couple of stretchers, closed his eyes and bounced up and down. There would be no more trash talk from Rashad: No more saying his opponent, fellow light heavyweight Phil Davis, looked like Arsenio Hall and John Salley had a baby. And no one talked to him, either: not Rashad’s coaches, not even Chael Sonnen – one of the few UFC fighters with a more notorious mouth than the cocksure Rashad. Sonnen strode by, bloody and weary after his hard-fought, controversial decision victory over Michael Bisping, and there wasn’t even a glimmer of recognition between the two. It was, finally, Rashad’s time. Sonnen’s win moments before had just set the stage for one fight UFC fans have been waiting for: A possible rematch with Brazilian MMA legend Anderson Silva. So now UFC fans turned their eyes toward this man, who needed to win this fight to give UFC fans the other fight they’ve been waiting for. The 32-year-old light heavyweight has been in title limbo since he relinquished the light heavyweight belt in 2009 in the first fight after he’d won it: Injuries, cancelled fights, frustration. Saturday’s fight was not the fight everyone had wanted, versus former NCAA wrestling champion Davis on UFC on FOX 2, even though the up-and-coming Davis was a dangerous opponent. But for Rashad, this fight was a big stepping stone. Win here and Rashad would get another shot at the title. Win here and Rashad would get another shot at Jon Jones, the training-partner-turned-nemesis whom Rashad believes is a disingenuous back-stabber (and who was in the FOX broadcast booth for this fight). Win here and UFC fans would get a fight for the ages, and Rashad would get another shot at glory. In sports, sometimes things don’t work out the way you want them to. The top seed gets knocked out in the first round of the playoffs; the fan favorite falls short. That is a big part of the beauty of the UFC, that on any given night, any given fighter can surprise you. But sometimes things do work out exactly as you want. And on Saturday night in Chicago, a night of plodding fights and arguable decisions, things worked out perfectly, and UFC fans got exactly what they wanted: A hard-fought Sonnen win followed by a decisive Rashad win, setting the table for two future fights that will make any MMA fan drool. Sonnen’s victory against the Briton was tight throughout. Sonnen jumped out to his typical frenetic pace, but Bisping surprised those who had him as a five-to-one underdog, defending many of Sonnen’s takedowns. Judges had Sonnen winning each of the three rounds, but Bisping thought he had at least two of those rounds won. No matter – UFC fans got what they wanted: A clear path from Sonnen to Silva. “I know that I’ll do my part in that,” Sonnen said afterward. “Do I think that (Anderson Silva) will sign the fight? No, I don’t ... They’ve offered him the fight four times, and he said no four times. Mysteriously he’s supposed to accept on the fifth? ... “I’d rather talk about real men like Mr. Bisping, who steps in on 10 days’ notice and fights me,” Sonnen said, relishing some post-fight trash-talk against his arch-nemesis. “Those are the kind of guys I’d rather give media attention to. Not some bum hiding out in Brazil.” After Sonnen’s victory, Rashad stood just out of sight of fans at the sold-out United Center, surrounded by his entourage. He was feeling the pressure. Earlier in the morning, he woke up and thought, “Man, I can’t lose this fight.” “When people are overlooking somebody like Phil Davis, it’s a dangerous thing,” Rashad said afterward. “Whether you want to or not, it kind of seeps in a little bit.” Rashad punched the air, pounded his own abs, then started to dance: It was time. “I just dial in, just bring myself really present into the moment,” he said afterward. Out in the arena, his song was playing, Mobb Depp’s “Survival of the Fittest” – fitting. Rashad walked to the Octagon, and fans, for once, applauded him, perhaps because he was in his adopted hometown. Davis stepped out confidently, but Rashad methodically clawed away at that confidence. He beat Davis in boxing, bloodying his lip. He beat Davis at Davis’ supposed strength, wrestling, taking him down again and again, catching him in a crucifix in the first round, elbowing Davis to the head in the second round. It wasn’t a dominating performance by Rashad, but he won every single round. His hands were clearly quicker than Davis’, and by the fifth round, as Davis tired, it was clear a still-bouncing Rashad had won the endurance game, too. Rashad seemed strangely disappointed by his victory – “I wanted to put on a more spectacular win,” he said afterward – but the most important thing Saturday was just to get past Davis. Sure enough, UFC president Dana White announced Saturday that Jones will be defending his light heavyweight title at UFC 145 in April in Atlanta. The opponent, one can surely guess, will be Rashad. “I definitely want to put the rivalry to bed, and more importantly get my belt back,” Rashad said afterward. “I’m not really too worried about the mystique of Jon Jones. Because I know Jon Jones’ core. I remember when Jon Jones used to come up to me and say, ‘Hey man, what’s it like when everybody wants to take pictures with you?’ So I know Jon Jones.” But enough of the trash-talk. This fight was barely won; Rashad hadn’t even been officially announced for that next fight. He just wanted to live in this moment. “There’s so much that has been said, there’s so much that’s going to be said between now and then,” he said. “Right now I just kind of want to just go back and enjoy this victory and think about the things I need to do to get ready for the fight against Jon Jones. Let tonight be tonight.” He paused for a moment. “I’ll get my mouth going probably later on,” he said. And we can’t wait.",Raw Data
536,"Mike and Bob Bryan have set one more record together as a doubles team - and this may be the most special of them all. The identical twins became the most decorated doubles team in Grand Slam history by winning their 13th major title at the Australian Open on Saturday, beating the unseeded Dutch pair of Robin Haase and Igor Sijsling 6-3, 6-4 in 53 minutes. ''To be a part of history is pretty special,'' Mike Bryan said. ''We weren't thinking about it much out there, but now that we have it, it's going to be fun to look back on our career and say we have the most Grand Slams.'' After converting their third match point, the brothers jumped in the air and bumped chests and then clapped their hands on their rackets to the several hundred fans who stayed in Rod Laver Arena after the women's singles final. They were so excited about the historic win, they gave high-fives to some fans after the match, including one man wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jersey who had covered the letter T in Kobe Bryant's last name so it read ''Bryan.'' Sijsling joked during the trophy presentation that he had lost count of how many titles the brothers had won. ''It's probably 15,'' he said. ''What is it?'' Haase then remarked, ''I still don't know who's who.'' The Bryans have won each major tournament at least once, but they play their best tennis Down Under - they now have six Australian Open titles to go along with four at the U.S. Open, two at Wimbledon and one at the French. ''I think we're so successful at this tournament because we spent the offseason mainly in the same spot working toward the new year,'' Mike Bryan said. ''We come into these tournaments with momentum.'' The list of the brothers' accomplishments and records keeps growing. They've been ranked No. 1 in doubles for eight of the past 10 years. They've won at least one Grand Slam title for a record nine consecutive years. They've won a record 84 titles together overall. Last year, they captured a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics - one of the only major awards they had yet to win. Having achieved so much, they were asked how they maintain their enthusiasm to keep playing a full tournament schedule. Last year, they played 73 matches together. ''As far as records, there's not much'' left to achieve, Bob Bryan said. ''But like we've told you before, we're competitors. We hate to lose. We want to finish No. 1.'' His brother said keeping up their energy levels is the only tough part. ''A lot of sugar before the matches,'' he said.",Raw Data

538,"Novak Djokovic appears to have found a way to reverse the normal process that regulates strenuous physical activity. The longer his matches go, the stronger he appears to get. Djokovic used that talent today to become the first man in Open era history to win the Australian Open three years in a row, with a convincing triumph over his emerging rival, Andy Murray. Djokovic won it, going away: 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-2. And he won it despite a start so slow that it seemed nearly providential that he didn’t find himself down two sets to none. “So what?” a Djokovic partisan might say to that. “He just would have won it in five then.” Amen to that. All I can say is that despite the exception that seems to prove the rule—Murray’s five-set win over Djokovic in the U.S. Open final last year—Nole’s rivals are fortunate that the format puts a cap on five sets. If tennis were a best-of-seven, nine, or 13 set affair, this guy probably would be invincible. Djokovic’s sixth Grand Slam title did not come easily. Contrary to the expectations of nearly everyone, we didn’t see a service break until deep into the third set (and nearly three hours into the match), when a gradual erosion of Murray’s effectiveness paid off with a break for Djokovic. But when the Scot’s wheels fell off, they came off quickly, and all at once. Murray, who had survived a four-hour semifinal with Roger Federer, came out breathing fire, raining down aces and winners hit from the backcourt to force the first set to a tiebreaker. Djokovic, meanwhile, was sluggish and irritable from the outset, finding fault with his shoes as well as his forehand and serve, which let him down in the first point of the tiebreaker. Djokovic double-faulted, and never put a first serve into play before losing it badly. It’s dodgy to call anything that happens in the first hour of a long and competitive match a turning point. But it’s hard to escape the feeling that things might have turned out differently had Murray capitalized on any of the three break points he held in the second game of the second set. The facts: Djokovic was overrun in the tiebreaker, after which Murray held the first game of the second set at love. Then Murray pinned Djokovic down in the second game, 0-40. But once Djokovic crawled up out of that hole—the critical shot was a volley winner that brought him to deuce, and prefigured the role net work would play in this match—he seemed to relax. He dialed in his game for the rest of the set and forced a tiebreaker. The first four points went on serve, but with Murray serving, a feather drifted down in front of him after he missed his first serve. Murray diligently removed the object, but proceeded to hit a double fault. After two quick holds by Djokovic, Murray was unable to hold the second of his serves and fell behind 3-6. Djokovic won the set when Murray flubbed a backhand drop shot. But the wear and tear still didn’t show on Murray through the early stages of the third set. Each man held with relative ease for the first seven games; at that point, Djokovic was 0-7 in break points, Murray 0-3. Djokovic made his move in the eighth game, with Murray serving. He ended a great rally with a massive inside-out forehand winner, won the next point with a prodigious drive volley, and hit 40-0 when he ended an exchange with a forehand cross-court winner. Murray fended off the first two break points, but Djokovic cashed in the third when the world No. 3 drove a forehand into the net. With a 5-3 lead, Djokovic hit a higher gear and ripped through his next service game to bag the set. Of interest: To that point, Murray had made his way to the net 12 times, winning eight of those points. But Djokovic had approached a full 31 times, and made good on an outstanding 27 of those opportunities. So much for the “new” offensive-minded Murray—Djokovic’s greater willingness and ability to take the forecourt was the most eye-opening aspect of this match. Although Murray held the first game of the fourth set and even had a break point in the second game (which he was unable to convert), the floodgates were open. Djokovic won eight of the nine games played following the first break of the match, resulting in a 5-1 fourth set lead. The rest was a mere formality, as Djokovic wrapped it up in three hours and 40 minutes when he converted his first match point thanks to a Murray backhand error. In all fairness, Murray struggled with some physical issues, including (apparently) blisters that required a trainer’s attention and some sort of hamstring pull. Federer, with his quicksilver game, probably took a lot more out of Murray than anyone thought. But even a fully fit and well-rested Murray—or Rafael Nadal, or Federer—faces a daunting mission these days if he challenges Djokovic to a war of attrition.",Raw Data
539,"Aldridge's turnaround jumper fell as time ran out and the Portland Trail Blazers came back from a 21-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 106-104 on Tuesday night. ''I knew,'' Batum said. ''I knew he was going to make it.'' Aldridge finished with 29 points and 13 rebounds for Portland, which trailed 101-94 with 2:18 left. J.J. Hickson had a season-high 26 points and 15 rebounds for his 25th double-double. After Wesley Matthews made two free throws to pull the Blazers to 101-98 with 52 seconds to go, Batum's 3-pointer tied the score. Dirk Nowitzki answered with his own 3 before Aldridge also had a 3 - the first one he's made this season - to tie it at 104 with 4.9 seconds left. O.J. Mayo was called for charging with 1.5 seconds to go, and Aldridge hit his jumper after the inbound from Matthews with 0.2 seconds left for the victory. ''He (Batum) has his hand up. He said he had a lot of faith in me,'' said Aldridge, recently named to an All-Star reserve for the second straight year. ''I had to watch it go in.'' As the confetti streamed down from the rafters of the Rose Garden, Aldridge was tackled by his teammates. ''He was smiling like a rookie, like his first NBA game,'' Batum said about Aldridge afterward. ''We needed those two shots (the 3-pointer and the game-winner). They show people that he really is an All-Star. He is an All Star. He's a go-to guy.'' Dirk Nowitzki finished with 26 points for Dallas, which had won six of its last eight games. ''We cannot let Aldridge get set on the block 10 feet from the basket and let him turn around and shoot a wide-open shot,'' Nowitzki said. ''We make those mistakes, especially on the road, and you are going to get bit.'' The Mavericks were without center Chris Kaman, who sustained a concussion in a collision during practice on Monday, according to coach Rick Carlisle. There was no timetable for Kaman's return. He is averaging 12.4 points and 6.2 rebounds this season. The injury comes as the Mavericks have juggled their centers, starting a different one in each of their last three games. Kaman, Elton Brand and rookie Bernard James have each taken turns. Brandan Wright also plays at center for the Mavs. James made his second straight start against the Blazers. ''It helps to have depth,'' Carlisle said. ''We need all those guys but this (Kaman's injury) is a big hit for us.'' In a first half marked by lackluster defense on both sides, Nowitzki's long jumper put Dallas up 37-28. Nowitzki, who missed the Mavericks' first 27 games after surgery on his right knee, hit another jumper that extended the lead to 47-36. Darren Collison scored 10 straight points and Dallas closed out the first half with 19-6 run to take a 59-42 lead. Portland struggled with its 3-point shot, going 2 for 12 in the first half. Mayo's step back jumper pushed Dallas' lead to 69-48 after the break. Batum, who had two triple-doubles last week for the Blazers, didn't hit from the field until a 3 with 4:43 left in the third quarter that made it 74-58. Luke Babbitt hit a 3-pointer and Aldridge made a short jumper to narrow it, and Portland pulled closer to 78-72 after Aldridge and rookie Damian Lillard each hit free throws. Portland finished the third on a 16-4 run to get within 74-80 to start the final period. Batum's driving layup cut Dallas' lead to 86-83 with 8:20 left. After Vince Carter made two free throws for the Mavs, Ronnie Price hit a 3-pointer and Sasha Pavlovic dunked to tie it up at 88. ''This type of loss is about as tough as it gets in the league,'' Nowitzki said. ''We played well enough to win it. Tonight we found a way to lose, instead of finding a way to win. That's the sad thing.'' Notes: The Mavs beat the Blazers 114-91 on Nov. 5 in Dallas. ... The Mavericks were flagged with a technical for six players on the floor late in the first half. ... Portland had 38 points in the third quarter, a season high. ... Aldridge and Hickson are the first Blazers to have at least 26 points and 13 rebounds in the same game since Clyde Drexler and Jerome Kersey on Dec. 2, 1987, against the Lakers. ... It was the 10th time this season the Blazers had won a game in which they trailed at halftime. ... Before Tuesday night, Aldridge had gone 0 for 9 from 3-point range.",Raw Data

Check in here for all the NFL head-coaching moves. Atlanta Falcons director of player personnel David Caldwell has been tabbed to succeed former Jags general manager Gene Smith, FOX Sports.com has learned. The Associated Press confirmed the move later Tuesday. Caldwell, who also interviewed with the New York Jets since the regular season ended, informed Woody Johnson and Co. on Tuesday that he was negotiating a deal with Jacksonville. Khan fired Smith on Dec. 31 after four disappointing seasons without a postseason appearance. Caldwell is now expected to make a decision on coach Mike Mularkey, AP reported. Mularkey went 2-14 in his first season in Jacksonville and has lost 20 of his past 23 games as a head coach. Khan gave Mularkey's assistants permission to search for other jobs last week, an indication that he doesn't expect to retain Mularkey or his staff. Then again, Caldwell and Mularkey have a relationship stemming from their time in Atlanta. Before becoming the Falcons' director of player personnel in 2012, Caldwell spent four seasons as Atlanta's director of college scouting — the same four years Mularkey served as offensive coordinator. Caldwell replaced Les Snead, who was hired as St. Louis' general manager last offseason. ''He's a great guy, a great family man, does a good job,'' Mularkey said of Caldwell last month. ''He had some experience in Indy before he got to Atlanta, and I thought he did a good job up there. ... I thought that (he would become a GM) when I worked with him, that he was heading in that direction.'' Caldwell was part of an Atlanta front office that drafted quarterback Matt Ryan, linebackers Curtis Lofton and Sean Witherspoon, offensive tackle Sam Baker, safety William Moore, receiver Julio Jones and running back Jacquizz Rodgers. He doesn't inherit as much talent in Jacksonville, but the Jaguars have the No. 2 pick in April's draft and plenty of room under the salary cap to make moves. And coming off the worst season in franchise history, it won't take much to show improvement. — The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Raw Data

NFL rules say the home team must certify prior to each game that the playing field meets certain conditions. There is a list of requirements, including an ''Impact Hardness Test.'' Carroll was more diplomatic when he met with reporters later Monday. He said there was a ''lot of loose footing'' in the game, but he said he didn't know if it contributed to Clemons' injury. ''It's cool to have the different stadiums have their own uniqueness about it,'' Carroll said. ''But there is a point where I think it makes sense that it should be somewhat standardized that it should be equal for everyone, and obviously safety is at the top of everyone's mind in the league.''

545,"There is really only one big question ahead of the start of the 2013 Formula 1 season in Melbourne, Australia next weekend - can anyone stop Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel marching to a fourth consecutive world championship? Pre-season testing has left an even murkier picture than normal. There have been tantalising hints that the season will be incredibly close - McLaren sporting director Sam Michael, for example, believes that nine of the 11 cars are within a second of each other in terms of lap time. And there have been flashes of pace from Ferrari, Lotus, McLaren and, most of all, from Mercedes. Play media Vettel happy with new Red Bull Lewis Hamilton generated a degree of disbelief when he decided last year to join a team who, at the time, were struggling to score points. But Mercedes appear to have made a dramatic step forward from midfield mediocrity to become genuine contenders. From talking about being happy to score points, Hamilton is now daring to entertain the prospect of wining the championship. ""It's not 'no chance' and it's not 'definitely we will',"" he said at the conclusion of testing. Meanwhile, Ferrari are clearly in much better shape than this time last season and that suggests their lead driver Fernando Alonso will be an even more formidable rival for Vettel than he was in 2012. Impressive though Vettel was, there is no question Alonso was the outstanding performer of last year. In a car that started the season two seconds off the pace, and was never fast enough to take a pole position in the dry, Alonso took the title fight to the final race and lost out by only three points. Alonso's helmeted face after climbing out of his car after the season finale in Brazil, eyes wide and staring straight ahead as he took in the enormity of the circumstances, is one of the pervading images of that year. Now, after recharging his batteries, he is ready to dig deep again. ""Last year was the best of my career and I was very happy with the performance, but I think this year will be better,"" he said. ""We have a better starting point. I have prepared better. I am better than last year. ""You can always improve as a driver. I am more motivated than last year, but I need a better car than last year because we were too far from the leaders. ""I expect the team to have a better car. We don't ask to be half a second in front of everybody, but two-tenths behind is OK."" In that line, immodest though it may be, is what appears to be a fundamental truth. If Alonso can do what he did last year in a car that was usually more than half a second off the pace in qualifying, what can he achieve this year in one that appears to be closer? Hamilton, also outstanding last year, should be in the mix. Give him a car close to the front, as Mercedes appear to have done, and he will extract every last ounce of performance from it. Play media Hamilton 'pleased' with pre-season testing Given half a chance, those two can give Vettel more than a run for his money. Alonso, Hamilton and Vettel are the outstanding drivers of their generation. But F1 2013 is about so much more than that. This is arguably the field with the greatest depth of talent in history. In Jenson Button, McLaren have a driver who, on his day, is perhaps better than anyone and alongside him the fascinating prospect of their yet-to-be-proven new signing Sergio Perez. Red Bull have the immensely strong and determined Mark Webber, determined to give not an inch to his team-mate while operating in an environment where he faces a degree of open hostility. There is the mixture of wisdom and fire in the Lotus line-up of Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean. And at Mercedes Nico Rosberg knows he is facing a career-defining season alongside Hamilton and has no intention of being steamrollered. The one team who have done very little in the way of headline-grabbing during pre-season are Red Bull, and that has been greeted with suspicion. They must be hiding something, people believe. They simply cannot be that slow. It is inconceivable that Red Bull have suddenly lost their way as the sport heads into the final year of a set of regulations which they have understood and exploited better than anyone else since their introduction in 2009. Vettel and the design team, led by the unmatched Red Bull chief technical officer Adrian Newey, prevailed in tight battles in 2010 and 2012, utterly dominated in 2011, and came very close to winning in 2009 as well. For the teams, this has been an era dominated by diffusers, the critical aerodynamic part at the back of the floor of the car. Since early summer 2009, Vettel and his team have been the combination to beat in F1, even last year when on balance it was McLaren, not Red Bull, who had the fastest car. Vettel's title triumph in 2012 hinged on a development that for four races in the autumn made the Red Bull unquestionably the strongest car on the grid. Play media Vettel on 'unreal' third title It allowed the team to create more aerodynamic downforce from the rear of the car in the way they had in 2010 and 2011 before teams were prevented from placing their exhausts on the floor of the cars for aerodynamic effect - so-called ""exhaust-blown diffusers"" were banned. Since last season, diffusers have still been blown, but imperfectly now, by exhaust gases that have to be guided to the critical area down channels, as on the Red Bull, or blasted across gaps, in the manner pioneered by McLaren and Ferrari last year. Red Bull's great leap forward came about because Newey found a way of linking the DRS overtaking aid with his exhaust-focused diffuser design via the lower part of the rear wing, unlocking extra pace in the car. But the avenue by which he did this has theoretically been closed off for 2013 - teams can no longer use the DRS on the upper rear wing to affect the aerodynamics of another part of the car, and the amount of time the DRS can be used has also been cut dramatically. So the question is, can Newey still find a way to use the DRS to bleed off on the straights the downforce he wants to be able to use in the corners to generate the optimum lap time? This question explains why Red Bull are among the teams pursuing a device that has come to be known as ""passive DRS"". This is creating a series of channels in the car that, above a certain pre-determined speed, direct air in a manner such that it reduces the downforce created by the rear wing - and therefore cuts drag. It is fiendishly difficult to pull off - Lotus spent much of last season trying and failing to make their system work. But if a team can do so there are potentially crucial gains to be had. And if any team can, it's Red Bull. If this all sounds immensely complicated, that's because it is. Formula 1 drivers possess a set of skills based on hand-eye co-ordination, balance and athleticism that is arguably unmatched across professional sport, but they can only show off their ability in the context of the laws of physics as they govern a grand prix car. Vettel has excelled in the last three years in his ability to change his driving style to match the unnatural behaviour of a car with exhaust-blown rear aerodynamics, which requires a counter-intuitive driving style of pressing the accelerator to counteract a sliding rear-end mid-corner. But while three consecutive titles make him statistically unmatched among the current field, that is not the same as being unequalled on the track. With the likes of Alonso and Hamilton determined to shoot him down, it promises to be a great season. As long as Mr Newey has not produced another engineering miracle for Vettel to exploit.",Raw Data

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. The NHL lockout lasted 113 days, cost at least a third of the regular season and was another stain on the stewardship of Commissioner Gary Bettman. The league and the NHL Players Association agreed to the framework of a new 10-year collective bargaining agreement early Sunday morning. The players are expected to ratify the deal shortly. FOXSports.com breaks down what’s known about the new deal and who benefits. Who were the winners in this lockout? That’s something that can’t be determined immediately, evidenced by the previous lockout that cost the 2004-05 season. The owners appeared to have throttled the players — who lost a whole season of paychecks and were forced to accept a salary cap — at the time. But the agreement that expired on Sept. 15 turned out to be a boon for the players. Some NHL stars went overseas during the lockout. Find out who went where. The players wound up with 57 percent of league revenue for the 2011-12 season, far better than the cut received by the two major US sports with a salary cap. (NFL players get about 47 percent of total revenues and the NBA players take about 51.5 percent.) The NHL owners — who insisted on linking the salary cap to overall league revenue — didn’t expect league revenues to rise 50 percent from when the lockout killed off the 2004-05 season to $3.3 billion last season. As a result, many teams were just as poorly off at the end of the most recent CBA as they were at the time of the lost season. What did the players give up? It's maybe not as painful as the salary cap they had to accept last time, but the NHLPA reportedly had to accept contract limits (seven years for free agents and eight for a team looking to sign a current player) and maximum salary variance (no more than 35 percent per season). Both are meant to protect owners from themselves. Weeks after the end of the last lockout, the New York Islanders inked goalie Rick DiPietro to a 15-year contract — one of the most dumbfounding deals in league history. In the seasons since, New Jersey Devils forward Ilya Kovalchuk (15 years), Nashville Predators defenseman Shea Weber (14), Ryan Suter and Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild (13 years each), Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin (13) and Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby (12) all have signed lengthy deals. Those deals can become albatrosses for organizations, although many teams tried to lessen the risk by front-loading such long-term deals. While the league has intervened and nullified Kovalchuk’s original deal in New Jersey, the new salary variance policy could be the only way to reign in such outlandish contracts. Clubs will be allowed to buy out one contract after each of the next two seasons. Players retained the right to go to arbitration, and the owners agreed to honor contracts (or at least a large portion of those contracts) under a “make whole” provision that will fund salaries early in the CBA. What did the owners give up? Depends on which franchise you’re talking about. The owners who suffered the most with this work stoppage are the most valuable franchises in the sport, including the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs and New York Rangers — all of which lost millions in ticket sales and regional TV revenue. Those are also the clubs that pushed against increased revenue sharing, something the NHLPA was a proponent of as a means to help the struggling clubs. For as much as teams such as the Columbus Blue Jackets and Florida Panthers were helped by seeing the players’ share of revenue cut, those same teams will get a major increase of funding by the more stable clubs. Revenue sharing is set to increase about 33 percent to $200 million to aid the league’s struggling clubs. About half of that money would come from the 10 most profitable franchises in the sport. The owners managed to keep the salary cap and had it cut in the first year to $60 million, $4.3 million less than last season. But the cap reportedly will return to $64.3 million in the second year, and teams will be allowed to exceed the cap in the first year to account for previous contracts. How close did the two sides come to another season cancellation? The two sides still had almost a week to come to an agreement to save a 48-game regular season, thought to be close to the minimum number of games to give the season a sense of legitimacy. The NHLPA twice let deadlines pass to approve a disclaimer of interest, which would have decertified the union and converted it into a trade organization. That would have allowed players to individually sue the NHL — much like several NFL players did when they were locked out before the 2011 season — and could have put the season in very serious jeopardy. When two strong-willed individuals such as Bettman and NHLPA executive director and former MLBPA union boss Don Fehr are involved, there was rightfully some concern as to whether a deal could be reached. What remains unresolved? Participation in the 2014 Winter Olympics will not be part of the CBA, TSN.ca reports. That is a serious issue since the game will be held in Sochi, Russia. Many owners would rather not stop the season and put their most valuable assets on the line for a contest they don’t feel benefits the league. Some Russian players — including Ovechkin — already have hinted that they will stay in the KHL even after the NHL season resumes. If the NHL chooses to forgo the Winter Games, the league could find itself without some of its better Russian-born players. It also wasn’t readily clear what the league’s drug policy — already the weakest in pro sports — will be. What does the agreement mean to the on-ice product? This comes down to exactly what the schedule will look like. The NHL is reportedly looking at either a 48- or 50-game schedule. (The first games will likely be played on Jan. 15 or Jan. 19, depending on which route the league takes.) The condensed schedule is expected to be heavy on intra-conference games, minimizing travel and emphasizing rivalries. That would benefit Eastern Conference teams, who — outside of a couple exceptions (most notably the Winnipeg Jets) — have a much less strenuous travel schedule than their West Coast counterparts. With fewer days off expected in the new schedule before the playoffs begin, that could play a major factor. The end result of the last time the league had a shortened season — a 48-game season in 1994-95 — was an Eastern Conference (New Jersey Devils) sweep of the Western Conference (Detroit Red Wings) in the Stanley Cup Final. The teams are currently scurrying to get their players back from European leagues. Days before the agreement, NHL teams had already quietly prepared for a short training camp. There will be rust, but the modern hockey player likely won’t arrive at the training facility out of shape this week. It would stand to reason that teams which did not undego massive changes before the lockout would have an edge, at least early in this truncated season. How will the fans react? Hockey’s venture toward becoming a niche entity in the minds of many sports fans was sealed with the lost season. There will always be hardcore hockey fans who, while resentful of the most recent work stoppage, will return immediately. The league bounced back quickly after losing an entire season. While the NHL did cancel the Winter Classic and All-Star Game this time around, it will still get a good chunk of the season along with the playoffs in. There isn’t nearly as far to rebound. Also, the NHL has something it didn’t have last time: a meaningful TV package.",Raw Data

The former British title winner is keen to regain the sparkling form of his early career after three tough campaigns so far on the world stage. The Fixi Suzuki rider has underlined his credentials by running at lap record pace at the coastal Philip Island circuit. Now he feels in good form after bouncing back from a massive crash last Friday. That wrecked his bike and left his team with a race against time to rebuild it ahead of yesterdays first day of official testing, but the incident did nothing to knock his confidence.

548,"That makes every year a referendum on those in charge of it. This will be especially true for the U.S. senior national team coaches in 2013. Jurgen Klinsmann on the men’s side and his newly-appointed women’s national team counterpart Tom Sermanni each have a great deal to prove in this coming year. In the summer of 2011, Klinsmann swept into office to see out the remainder of Bob Bradley’s aborted 4-year World Cup cycle on a platform of hope and change. Yet he has delivered a mixed bag. Results have been confounding. World-beaters Italy and arch-enemy Mexico were slain on their own turf for the first time ever. The 9-2-3 U.S. record ties its best ever record. It posted the same record in 2008. Yet for all its success against soccer’s superpowers, the U.S. had immense trouble getting results against lesser lights such as Jamaica, Antigua & Barbuda and Guatemala, its opponents in the third phase of World Cup Qualifying. To justify his $2.5 million annual salary, Klinsmann was to totally retool the U.S. national team and in so doing push the team into the world’s elite. From Dempsey to Reyna, find out the best US footballers of all-time. “We have a bit of a different approach than before my time,” Klinsmann said in a recent conference call. “It is a work in progress and a positive work in progress. One thing is the technical game on the field. We are improving the way we push the whole game into the opponent’s half, keeping the ball, playing one-two touches fast and playing out of the back, and here and there putting high pressure on the opponents. This is a process that will take time. I’m pleased with the progress. I really think that we are developing a style that suits us and that the players are enjoying.” Yet the gap between what Klinsmann sees and what everybody else has observed is growing large. Many, myself included, only see a team that has regressed to a tepid impersonation of the U.S. of old. If Klinsmann was to take the team from reactive and dreary to proactive and pretty, he has only produced an even more negative and mirthless side, possibly realizing why the Yanks had built their game around physicality and toughness all along – they’re ill-suited to anything else. Where Bradley was criticized for fielding two holding midfielders, Klinsmann customarily inserts three into his lineup. And his team lacks the sharpness on the counterattack that his predecessor fostered. In 2013, we should learn whether all his big ideas were just so much hot air, or whether he is truly capable of implementing his grand vision of remaking the way a vast nation plays. World Cup qualifying begins in earnest on February 6, when the U.S. travels to Honduras to kick off the all-important hexagonal round, which will send three or four – pending a playoff with Oceania – of six entrants to Brazil following a double round-robin. In July, the U.S. will play in and host the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, a tournament with little upside to the U.S. but plenty of scope for embarrassment. That’s exactly what happened in the 2009 tournament, when the U.S. lost the final to Mexico 5-0 with a cobbled-together team in the middle of another World Cup qualifying campaign. All these murky and treacherous waters Klinsmann will have to navigate, while convincing an increasingly skeptical American soccer scene – where the immense credit he brought into the job on the strength of his reinvention of Germany’s national team is fast eroding – that he knows what he’s doing. Sermanni's mandate, meanwhile, is to keep the U.S. women among the world’s elite, rather than to get them there. His predecessor Pia Sundhage – who left the job to take over her native Sweden – left some big shoes to fill, winning two Olympic gold medals. Yet Sermanni’s women also compete by the graces of their superior athleticism, mentality and organization. He understands full well that the rest of the world is closing the gap by developing technically. “The game is changing at a rapid pace,” Sermanni said recently. “The quality and closeness of the teams is much more pronounced than in the 1990s and 2000s. I don’t think you can just sit back and hope upon hope that the team is going to continue to be successful.” Clearly, there is some remodeling to be done. And while there are two and a half years yet to go until the next major tournament, the 2015 Women’s World Cup, it is a task that needs tending to early. Yet the chemistry of this dynastic group has proved fragile in the past. Sundhage was a master, more than anything, at keeping the peace. Sermanni will have to accomplish the same while also easing it into a new mindset. “You don’t come into a team like this and make radical changes,” he said upon his appointment. “That would be an unwise thing to do. But you do want to keep developing your team to play a better brand of soccer, to develop positive possession where the team is comfortable on the ball and patient. I think it’s a reality in the modern-day game that you no longer win games on pure fitness. We need to strive to improve the U.S. team in that area.” That means solving various puzzles that Sundhage left unfinished. Like how to get more technical players like Megan Rapinoe, Lauren Cheney and Tobin Heath onto the field without softening up defensively. Or finding a role for dynamic young forward Sydney Leroux alongside superstar strikers Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan without sacrificing too much in midfield. Will Sermanni figure it out? Will Klinsmann? For both Europeans charged with the fortunes of American national teams, this will be a year where they will need to produce some answers.

With 15 games to go, I think it can be safely said that the EPL title is staying in Manchester. It is conceivable that United or City might slip enough to encourage Chelsea, but not both. And there’s another worry for London fans – another giant of the north is awakening. It has been obvious for most of the season that Liverpool, after the ill-fated stewardship of first Roy Hodgson and then Kenny Dalglish, is at last moving in an upward direction under Brendan Rodgers, the former Chelsea assistant coach who made his name by guiding Swansea City into the top division and keeping the Welsh club there last season with a stylish brand of passing soccer. Results have not always been great and even after Saturday’s 5-0 rout of Norwich City, the stats show Liverpool triumphant in only nine of 23 League games (seven have been tied and seven lost). But performances have won over the fans, persuading them that owners John Henry and Tom Werner got it right in moving outside the Anfield family to hire Rodgers, just as predecessors Tom Hicks and George Gillett were derided for choosing Hodgson. So the Northern Irishman has got a little time – that most precious of commodities - on his side. He also has the advantage of relatively realistic expectations, for, although Liverpool became accustomed to success while winning 13 English and four European titles between 1964 and 1990, the triumph over Milan on penalties under Rafa Benitez in Istanbul in 2005 is now seen for what it was: a glorious throwback fuelled by tradition. Where once there was pressure – so great in fact that Dalglish had to walk away from his first spell as head coach in 1991 - there is now patience. But the return to Champions League contention may come sooner than most of the supporters envisioned. The weekend win kept Liverpool in touch with the London clubs most favored for a top-four finish. Chelsea remains the favorite for third, and Tottenham for fourth – but the threat from Merseyside is there. (And it is two-pronged, for cross-city rivals Everton have been staying in touch with the Champions League race as well.) Liverpool, though, has the resources to kick on more convincingly. Rodgers showed that by paying $16 million at the start of the winter window for Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge, who has scored in each of his first three games, forming a relationship of promise with Luis Suarez. In midfield, the return of enforcer Lucas after long-term injury must have felt like a new signing to Rodgers. Lucas’ return has certainly coincided with a spurt of vintage form from an appreciative Steven Gerrard. But optimism about Liverpool is not so much about individuals than the spirit fostered under Rodgers and apparent belief in his methods amongst his squad. There was no lack of enthusiasm during Dalglish’s term in charge – quite the opposite – but somehow the team’s effort is more channeled under the present regime. Young players such as the full back Andre Wisdom and potentially prodigious attacker Raheem Sterling are bedded in and learning fast. If the breakthrough to the Champions League does not happen this season, my hunch is that it will happen in the ensuing campaign – and that Gerrard, revitalized, will still be around. Which stars could be on the move? Find out with Rumor Redux. But who, if it happens, will Liverpool edge out of the elite group? Clearly the parallel ambitions of Tottenham are being challenged by the rise of Rodgers’s men. And Arsenal have for some time seemed likely to take a rare season out of Europe’s top competition, even more so after Sunday’s defeat in a classic game in the Stamford Bridge sleet. Chelsea, 2-1 victors after taking a two-goal lead in the opening 16 minutes, ought to be concerned too. This club’s future is notoriously difficult to predict and right now it remains torn by the fans’ split loyalties. Most still want Benitez out despite the derby win, but I wonder who could be enticed in his stead after the spectacular snub to owner Roman Abramovich represented by Pep Guardiola’s decision last week to spend next season in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. The top coaches of Europe have become wary of Abramovich after he sacked Roberto di Matteo so soon after the success in last season’s Champions League final. Yet Benitez was engaged as 'interim' coach on the assumption that an exciting name could be unveiled. Stability is back in fashion. And which club has got that back? Liverpool.

550,"The Lakers, a city treasure that sports one of the NBA's highest payrolls and generations of loyal fans, are said to be worth an estimated $1 billion. But will they remain the property of the Buss family after team owner Jerry Hatten Buss' death Monday? AEG Chairman Philip Anschutz, who owns Staples Center, the Los Angeles Kings and 27 percent of the Lakers, has the right of first refusal if the Buss family wants to sell the franchise, purchased by Buss in 1979. Other owners include Patrick Soon-Shiong with 4 percent and Ed Roski with 3 percent. The Buss family owns the remaining 66 percent. So, it doesn't seem a sale is likely, as per a statement released Monday by surviving family members. ""It was our father's often stated desire and expectation that the Lakers remain in the Buss family. The Lakers have been our lives as well and we will honor his wish and do everything in our power to continue his unparalleled legacy,"" the statement said. The ownership stake held by the Buss family will now be held in a trust. The team cannot be sold off in smaller pieces, only in its two-third entirety. ""The entity cannot be split,"" Buss family spokesman Bob Steiner said Monday. The lucrative TV deal the franchise struck last year with Time Warner Cable was viewed as a key to keeping the team in the family. It is worth $3.6 billion over 20 years and potentially $5 billion if the Lakers exercise a five-year extension at the end of the contract. It's a sizable cushion until at least 2032 that patches over innumerable annual costs, including the Lakers' $100-million payroll for a stunningly underperforming team this season. ""The future of the organization will remain unchanged,"" Lakers spokesman John Black said. ""Dr. Buss set it up years in advance. He planned for continuation, for the team to remain within the family. That's something that he did undertake."" Even if some Buss family members wanted to sell, there would be factors limiting that possibility. A majority vote (four of six) would be needed among Buss' adult children Jim, Jeanie, Johnny, Joey, Jesse, and Janie Drexel. Buss' ex-wife, JoAnn, also owns an undisclosed share of the team that is part of the family stake but does not get a vote. Jeanie will be listed as the team's governor, a position that gives her the power to voice the Lakers' vote on issues at owners' meetings. She has been the team's alternate governor for several years but now takes her father's title. On paper, it makes her the most powerful of the heirs. Despite limitations preventing an individual heir from selling the team, the relationship between Jim and Jeanie Buss will be important. They were put on divergent paths by their father several years ago Jim oversees basketball operations, Jeanie is in charge of the business side and they experienced conflict last November when Mike D'Antoni, not Phil Jackson, was hired to coach the Lakers after Mike Brown was abruptly fired. Jeanie, Jackson's fiance, believed her brother would re-hire the former Lakers coach after meeting with him at Jackson's Playa del Rey house. The job was not offered at the time to Jackson, who requested two days to ponder a return to basketball. A day later, however, the Lakers hired D'Antoni and followed it up with an infamous midnight phone call to Jackson, waking him up to inform him he would not return to the Lakers. Jeanie was notably displeased, according to a person familiar with the situation. Jim and Jeanie were at their father's side often as Buss battled a rare undisclosed form of cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His official cause of death was kidney failure, a complication from the cancer. ""Things will continue with them each having their own responsibilities,"" Steiner said.

551,"Nike, which outside of Tiger Woods has made a string of bad bets in golf sponsorship — from David Duval to Anthony Kim — hopes to turn its fortunes around by pegging its future in the sport to Rory McIlroy. The ubiquitous Swoosh, which has relied almost entirely on Woods to drive its golf product, announced on Monday a deal with his emerging young rival that has been reported to be worth as much as $200 million. Several insiders have told me that number’s inflated, but even if it’s half of that sum, the affable 23-year-old Northern Irishman has financially secured his future. So in that sense, it was, as they say, a no-brainer for McIlroy, who joins a stable that includes such top-of-the-mountain stars as Derek Jeter, Roger Federer, Adrian Peterson, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Cristiano Ronaldo. ""I've always associated Nike with the best,"" McIlroy said at a no-expense-spared unveiling in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where he will open his 2013 playing schedule this week. ""Growing up, whether it was golf, tennis, football, the best athletes were with Nike. I've watched Tiger Woods make history with Nike, and Roger Federer, and Rafael Nadal. Now I want to create my own history with Nike. “Nike is a company and a brand that really resonates with me. It's young. It's athletic. It's innovative. They are committed to being the best."" If the deal wasn’t a tough sell for McIlroy, it makes even more sense for Nike, which has seen its golf business — with revenues at about three-quarters of a billion dollars — slump since Woods’ infamous crash into a fire hydrant in November 2009. Woods, for many years second only to Michael Jordan on the Rushmore of product endorsers, still moves the needle, but he also has become a very polarizing figure. McIlroy might not be as well known — yet — but he already has won two majors and comes with no baggage. ""Rory is an extraordinary athlete who creates enormous excitement with his on-course performance while, at the same time, connecting with fans everywhere,"" said Nike Golf president Cindy Davis. “He is the epitome of a Nike athlete.” Although it seems a perfect marriage at first glance, it’s still a relationship that contains significant risk for both parties. In truth, Nike — a late-comer to the golf business — has struggled to overcome the perception that its clubs and balls aren’t of the same quality as those of its more established competitors. Phil Mickelson, whose deal with Callaway Golf is the only one in the same orbit as those of McIlroy and Woods, once infamously said that the testament to Woods’ greatness was that he achieved it with “inferior equipment.” If McIlroy doesn’t play as well as he did last year, when he won five times including the PGA Championship, the blame will be put on the new equipment. Golf’s a sport littered with instances of players taking the money and switching equipment, only to never reach the same heights again. McIlroy’s game is based on driving the ball long and straight, so the driver — the company has unveiled a new red driver it’s hailing as its best ever — and ball will be crucial. ""The driver is awesome,"" McIlroy said on Monday. ""I'm really excited about the Nike equipment. I was blown away with the technology. As soon as I hit (the driver), I knew it was in my bag straight away.” Many, including Nick Faldo, have worried that McIlroy is playing with fire by making such big changes all at once in what will be a seminal year for him. (Woods, for example, slowly integrated Nike equipment, meticulously testing sometimes for as long as a year before putting a club into his bag.) McIlroy, though, doesn’t see a problem. ""I've been testing all the way through Christmas. I've been practicing hard in the offseason. This equipment change has been seamless,"" he said. ""I think I can take my game to another level."" With so much at stake, he will need to, beginning on Thursday, when he and Woods tee it up for the first time in the 2013 season, at the Abu Dhabi Championship.",Raw Data
552,"Jason Whitlock writes about the sports world from every angle, including those other writers can't imagine or muster courage to address. His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. The end of a professional athlete's career is so swift, unforgiving and uncompromising that it makes you wonder what measures you would take, what rules you would ignore, what ethics you would sacrifice to stave it off. I hesitated writing this column. The points I want to make, the things I want to discuss can easily be distorted and misinterpreted. We don’t handle nuance very well in this soundbite, First Take, talk-radio sports world. We still see good guys and bad guys rather than guys who do a little more good or a little more bad than the average guy. We want everything to be as simple as expressing outrage toward Jerry Sandusky’s depraved, mentally-ill behavior. Most things just aren’t that simple. Endings are complicated. And so are people, especially those dealing with their demise. This is why I’ve never expressed much vitriol toward Lance Armstrong. He was given a death sentence, a cancer diagnosis in 1996 at the height of his athletic prowess. Does that excuse the lies he’s told, the corners he cut to remain at the top of his profession? Absolutely not. But it does significantly soften my perspective. I may not agree with the decisions he made, but I understand them. We’re such a hero-worshipping society that it’s easy for me to see how Armstrong concluded his cycling resurrection and support of cancer research were more important than any truth about the measures he took to reach the top. We’ve set a nearly unavoidable trap for professional athletes. We’ve built multi-billion-dollar television networks dependent upon them for ratings, networks that spend hours each day convincing them and us that they’re far more important than they really are. Before they’ve reached middle-age and any real maturity, we’ve bathed them in self-awareness-killing money and fame. We’re so entertained and envious of their athletic gifts that we allow and/or bait them into focusing almost exclusively on their physical development. They’re largely unprepared for a life outside the athletic arena. Given all this and their highly competitive nature, is it surprising they live in fear of their career ending by their late 20s? Is it all that surprising they cut corners? I’ve intentionally buried the lead of this column. This is a column about performance-enhancing drugs and how we should view them when it comes to professional athletes. I buried the lead because I don’t want my words to be twisted and exploited. I don’t want to unfairly besmirch the names and reputations of the athletes mentioned in this column. Armstrong and A-Rod have been involved in PED controversies. Bryant, Manning and Lewis have not. I’m not accusing Bryant, Manning and Lewis of using PEDs. I’m saying we’ve set up an athletic world that begs them to. And if that’s the case, maybe we should reconsider how we view PEDs. A-Rod has more than $100 million left on his contract. He’s a pariah in NYC. He’s a national laughingstock. We’ve never seen the most physically gifted player and highest-paid player benched in the postseason. At age 37, he’s under the kind of performance-enhancing pressure a 15-year-old virgin might feel hopping into the sack with Nikki Benz. Do you think whichever team employs A-Rod in 2013 cares what he does to hit .320 and 40 home runs next year? Do you think anyone cares what Kobe Bryant does to get his knees ready for an 82-game NBA season? You think David Stern and the league’s television partners care? The same could be said of Peyton Manning’s neck and Ray Lewis’ triceps. I hope Kobe plays forever (as long as he’s never perceived as a better player than Magic Johnson). Kobe is entertaining, compelling and fun to analyze. So are Manning, Lewis and A-Rod. My position on PEDs has been pretty consistent for quite some time. Athletes are entertainers, the same as musicians. I don’t much care what drugs Led Zeppelin, Guns N Roses or Marvin Gaye used to make good music. I don’t care what athletes do to take the field. Again, I am not accusing these great athletes of using PEDs. I’m asking you to evaluate the situations we’ve placed them in. The longer you stay in professional sports the more valuable you become to the leagues and their broadcast partners and the more pressure you face to avoid the end. I don’t have a solution for how to handle PEDs. I believe the solution starts with undemonizing them and the athletes who fall into the trap we laid.",Raw Data
553,"Alessio Cerci has shone at TorinoEvery now and again Alessio Cerci still thinks about it. Why wouldn't he? Things could have been so so different. Watching Manchester City dramatically win the Premier League title in stoppage time on the final day of last season, a part of him presumably thought that it should have been him. Roberto Mancini had apparently wanted to buy Cerci from Fiorentina ahead of that campaign. ""He's the best winger in Italy,"" the City manager supposedly said. Yet his interest in Cerci was quite surprising. Because, while he'd scored seven goals in Serie A the previous season and was finally showing signs of fulfilling his potential under the then Fiorentina coach and Mancini's former assistant at Inter Sinisa Mihajlovic, it was hard to imagine him ever seriously competing for a place in City's first team. This was the sort of signing you'd have expected City to make before the club's takeover by Sheikh Mansour. In terms of profile, it was closer to Rolando Bianchi and Bernardo Corradi than, say, Daniele De Rossi, another transfer target at the time. Maybe that's harsh. But then it's also true that when Cerci did eventually leave Fiorentina this summer, it was for Torino where, as it happens, the 25-year-old now trains and plays alongside Bianchi. Now 25, looks back on how near he was to joining City with understandable regret. ""The deal seemed closed,"" Cerci revealed to La Gazzetta dello Sport. ""They told me that it was 99% done. Then I don't know what happened."" Its collapse took some getting over. ""I believe that I deserved that opportunity,"" Cerci added, ""otherwise they wouldn't have inquired about me."" From then onwards, he began to act like he was entitled to it. They, or someone of equal stature, would be back. And this, it might be said on reflection, was the beginning of Big Time Cerci. For instance, during pre-season that summer, Mihajlovic told him to go for a run. Cerci didn't fancy it, though. His foot hurt. As you can imagine, a hard man like Mihajlovic wasn't having it. They rowed and Cerci was not named in the squad for a friendly against Newcastle United. Things would deteriorate further throughout last season. Fiorentina's Curva Fiesole had never really warmed to Cerci. In truth, they were suspicious of him, not least because there had been sightings of him supposedly walking around town with a cat on a leash. How eccentric, you might think. Evocative no doubt of another Torino winger, the great Gigi Meroni, who once pulled up in Como, his conservative hometown, got out of his car and proceeded to walk a chicken around the main square on a lead before then taking it down to the lake where he tried, unsuccessfully, to put a bathing suit on his feathered friend. Unlike Meroni in the `60s, however, Cerci wasn't seeking to make a statement challenging social conventions. In this case, the people had simply got it wrong. ""It wasn't a cat,"" Cerci would later clarify, ""but my chihuahua Stiui."" Of course, Cerci's choice of pet wasn't the reason why he fell foul of the Fiorentina fans. That would be petty. Rather there was an element of Campanilismo to it; that strong sense of local identity and the pride taken in it. As a Roman in Florence and one who had played for regional ""rivals"" Pisa too, Cerci was a guest of the city and as such there was an expectation that at the very least he should treat its people and its club with a certain degree of respect. By their standards, he didn't do that. Apocryphal are the tales of Cerci's many run-ins with the local traffic wardens. On his way out for a meal one time, he reportedly parked his Maserati where he shouldn't have. It was a bay reserved for the police. When told to move his vehicle, Cerci apparently got cocky and said sure he would but not until after he'd eaten. ""Don't you know who I am?"" was the gist of it. It was as though he felt he were untouchable, that he could do whatever he wanted. Some of the criticism was unfair. Travelling to Formentera to complete on a villa after a 2-0 defeat to Palermo probably wasn't the best idea. Certainly when he had a new manager to impress in Delio Rossi after Mihajlovic had been sacked. His priorities were questioned. But at least Cerci had Fiorentina's permission. Unfortunately the notary got delayed. Cerci arrived back to training a day later than expected and was dropped. And just when you thought his relationship with the supporters couldn't get any worse, his girlfriend got involved. After Fiorentina beat Novara 3-0 with Cerci demoted to the bench, a status update on a Facebook page that was attributed to her read as follows: ""They won a game against Novara and it seems like they've won the Champions League against Barcelona. Fools!!!"" When her beau wasn't named in the team to face former club Roma in the Coppa Italia three days later, she returned to social media. ""No Cerci? No Coppa Italia!!! ahahahaha... bye bye Delio and bye bye Viola fans ;)"" Cerci denied the messages had come from her. He'd rescue the situation a little later on in the season by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win at Lecce on the penultimate day of the campaign to ensure that Fiorentina survived relegation. Another incident in pre-season, however - the damage to a restaurant booked to celebrate his birthday and the insults alleged to have been directed towards its owner by those in attendance - was said to have led Fiorentina to declare: 'Basta'. ""I had nothing to do with it,"" Cerci insisted in his defence. ""Other teammates drank and made a mess that night. I'll never name names."" In fairness to Cerci you do get the feeling he was made a scapegoat for Fiorentina's problems. They didn't just get rid of him this summer. They got rid of the director of sport, the interim manager [as one might expect] and 13 other players, among whom Juan Manuel Vargas, Andrea Lazzari and Houssine Kharja had also had disciplinary issues [the latter, it must be remembered, only for his wish to commute from Milan to Florence for family reasons]. So it was clear that there was something rotten about the state of Fiorentina as a whole. ""There's been an extraordinary furore around me,"" he lamented. ""Unmanageable Cerci. Arrogant Cerci. Cerci who only thinks about nice cars... So what? Many people like cars and I mean no harm. ""The image of a hot head doesn't belong to me. I'm a very simple guy. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't go out whoring."" Cerci isn't of the opinion that Fiorentina sold half of his rights to Torino this summer because he was a bad apple or that they'd had enough of his character. ""Perhaps it was transfer strategy,"" he argues. ""Or maybe because [Vincenzo] Montella needed a wide-player who's better at tracking back than I am in a 3-5-2."" Still, you get the distinct impression that a fresh start was exactly what Cerci required. Torino wanted him dearly. President Urbano Cairo even caught up with Cerci on holiday at Forte dei Marmi to convince him to join. The appeal was certainly strong. Moving to Torino would mean a reunion with Giampiero Ventura, his former coach at Pisa, where the 20-year-old Cerci had been sent on loan by Roma. While there he would provide the inspiration for a run into the Serie B play-offs, adding to the hype that had followed him ever since Fabio Capello had given him a Serie A debut at the age of 16. Ventura and Cerci were a perfect match. Here was an Italian coach renowned for playing a 4-2-4 formation, a system that exalts the winger. Traditionally Italy doesn't produce many. Anyone with skill is usually told to come inside and become a No.10. Meroni, Pietro Fana, Bruno Conti and Roberto Donadoni are the few natural wide men that spring to mind. All too aware of this, Ventura has a real appreciation of Cerci. He recognises him for what he is: a rarity in the Italian game. ""With me [Ventura] shows a patience that the others didn't have,"" Cerci told Sportweek. ""He knows he has an important player on his hands. He has best understood my potential."" Unsurprisingly, Cerci has flourished this season and if newly promoted Torino are comfortable in midtable, a lot of it is down to him. Italy coach Cesare Prandelli was in the stands on Sunday to watch him score and put in a Man of the Match performance in a 2-1 win against Atalanta. A call up to La Nazionale is expected. Rather than acting up, Cerci has finally got his act together. ""I hope it comes across that I have understood that you need to live a professional life to give your best on a Sunday. Eat healthily, get to bed early and train with intensity."" ""I wish to show who I really am at Torino, something I have only managed up until now in flashes. I have examined my conscience. I know that I've made mistakes, but there's still time to give a sense to my career and end up at a great club."" Maybe not City. For that ship has sailed. But there'll be others, certainly in Italy, if Cerci continues playing like this from now until the end of the season.",Raw Data

555,"Each FOXSports.com fantasy contributor shared three-to-five fantasy baseball sleepers to keep an eye on heading into owners' fantasy baseball drafts. Over the next two months, expect several updates to our positional fantasy baseball catcher rankings. Jesus Montero, Mariners – Montero didn’t quite live up to his heightened expectations in his rookie season, but he wasn’t dreadful, either, hitting .260 with 15 jacks and 62 RBI. He was a bigger disappointment in OBP leagues (just a .298 mark) and playing half his games in Safeco Field isn’t doing him any favors (.227/.268/.337 in 70 games). However, after a slow start in the Emerald City, Montero showed signs of life in the second half, posting a .278 average after the All-Star break. Moreover, the 23-year-old is expected to make a majority of his appearances at designated hitter, bestowing more playing time than most players with catcher eligibility. With the potential of a top-five player at the position, Montero’s expected draft selection in the later rounds is a steal. A.J. Pierzynski, Rangers – How about a good ‘ol fashioned blind resume comparison? From last season: Player A: 592 PA, 23 HR, 83 RBI, 67 R, .249/.329/.435 Player B: 520 PA, 27 HR, 77 RBI, 68 R, .278/.326/.501 The former would be Baltimore backstop Matt Wieters, most likely the third catcher picked in your draft, while the latter is Pierzynski, who will go unselected in a fair amount of standard leagues. Highly unlikely that the 36-year-old Pierzynski replicates his bomb barrage from last year, as the former All-Star hit just 43 four-baggers in the previous four campaigns. However, Pierzynski is remarkably consistent from an average perspective, with a .283 figure from the last five seasons. Better yet, Pierzynski joins one of the more explosive offensives in the American League that plays in a hitter-friendly ballpark. Though the long balls will drop, envision the ribbies and runs to remain solid, if not improve. Ryan Doumit, Twins – Like Montero, Doumit’s greatest asset is that he won’t necessarily be featured as a catcher, logging more than 55 percent of his playing time in 2012 at designated hitter or in the outfield, saving his legs and extending his appearances. At first glance, duplicating last year’s 18 blasts may be a tall order for Doumit, yet the elevated figure is more a byproduct of increased plate appearances rather than coincidence, as his home run to fly ball rate was consistent with his historical output. His value takes a slight decline in OBP formats, and his average will likely regress in 2013, yet as a No. 2 catcher or starter in deeper leagues, Doumit is a dependable entity. Alex Avila, Tigers – At this juncture last winter, Avila was ranked in most preseason lists as a top-five player behind the plate. Heading into 2013, Avila is on the outside looking in on most top-15 backstop rankings. The drops in power and run production were the upshots of decreased playing time and injuries, and though his .295 average from 2011 might be an aberration, the Detroit catcher’s 23.8 line-drive percentage states his .243 batting mark from last year should have been better. The upcoming campaign will only be the fourth full year in the majors for the 25-year-old, making expectations for improvement a realistic endeavor. Kurt Suzuki, Nationals – Wilson Ramos is expected back from his 2012 knee injury, but the Nats’ website says he’ll be brought along slowly, leaving Suzuki atop the depth chart when Spring Training begins. Why would you want a catcher who’s batted .242, .237 and .235 over the past three seasons? Because he perked up in the second half of last season, hitting .267 with six homers and a .733 OPS (and a lower strikeout rate). Remember 2008 and 2009, when Suzuki batted in the .270s and averaged double-digit homers? We might see that guy again. Suzuki isn't a bad choice for a mixed-league second catcher, even with Ramos looming as a playing-time threat. Jason Castro, Astros – No, I will NOT make a “Castro the Astro” joke. Castro hit four home runs in the final seven games of 2012, but that’s not why he’s here – at least not entirely. After missing 2011 with a knee injury, Castro batted .267 with a .735 OPS (19th among catchers with 250 plate appearances). He has a pretty good eye, and a minor-league track record of solid batting averages. Castro won’t give you tons of pop, but as a mixed-league No. 2, he could provide decent counting stats with a solid BA. There are a lot of .230 hitters at this position, in case you forgot. Ryan Lavarnway, Red Sox – At press time – do they still say “press time?” – the Sox were close to signing Mike Napoli, but he’s expected to spend most of his time at first base. That currently leaves them with a catching platoon of Jarrod Saltalamacchia and David Ross. Salty got some credit for a breakout 2012, but his 25 homers were weighed down by a .222 BA, a .288 on-base percentage and whiffs in 31 percent of his plate appearances – a rate exceeded by only five major leaguers with more than 300 at bats. Whether the Red Sox are contending or rebuilding, they probably know that the powerful Lavarnway (34 HRs across three levels in 2011, only 10 HRs with an .815 OPS in 2012) is a better hitter than Saltalamacchia, who could be dealt before Opening Day. Even if Lavarnway starts the season in the minors, and even if he shares time with David Ross in Boston, the bet here is that he’ll hit a dozen homers with a solid BA. Michael Zunino, Mariners – Zunino isn’t in my top 40 yet, because even though he’ll reportedly compete for the starting job in Spring Training, actually <i>getting</i> it with only 57 plate appearances above A ball sounds like a longshot. Still, he hit 13 homers with a 1.137 OPS in 161 at bats between rookie league and Double A. Whenever Zunino gets the call to Seattle – and it could be right out of Spring Training – he should play and provide enough pop to make himself useful in deeper mixed leagues. Keeper leaguers should snatch up Zunino in drafts. Fowler Salvador Perez, Royals - As far as I see it, the term “sleeper” carries several different meanings in fantasy baseball circles. For Sal Perez, the hype is evident and nobody is sleeping on the Royals’ catcher. However, that hype turns off some fantasy owners and knocks him down composite rankings. Those owners will wait for their buddy to reach on Perez, in favor of finding better value with their pick that round. Well, at this point, I’m “that guy” buying into the hype. In an abridged 2012 season (knee surgery), Perez hit .301 (.328 OBP) with 11 home runs in 289 at bats. In 32 winter-league games (Venezuela), Perez hit .371 (.412 OBP) with eight home runs and 39 runs batted in. His minor league numbers suggest with temper power expectations, but the average is comparable. With a shallow talent pool at catcher, I’m willing to gamble early on a guy who can hit around .300 with 15-20 home runs Jonathan Lucroy, Brewers - Although it was a freak accident, owners were displeased with the wife of Jon Lucroy last May when she dropped a suitcase on his hand, broke it and forced the Brewers’ catcher to miss all of June and most of July. Despite the absence, digest these year-over-year stats: 2011: 430 AB / 45 R / 16 2B / 12 HR / 59 RBI / .265 BA 2012: 316 AB / 46 R / 17 2B / 12 HR / 58 RBI / .320 BA With Ryan Braun, Aramis Ramirez and Corey Hart ahead of him in the lineup, expect Lucroy to drive in more runs in 2013. Carlos Ruiz, Phillies - “Chooch” broke our hearts after testing positive for amphetamines this past November. He’s suspended the first 25 games of the season, which allows him to return to the Phillies in late-April. His three-year average is over .300 with over 100 hits in each of the last three seasons. However, at the age of 34 (as of January 22), Ruiz’s ancillary fantasy stats, especially his unexpected 16 home runs in 2012, could sway drastically to the negative. Ruiz falls into my buyer beware bucket. Welington Castillo, Cubs - It’s no secret that the new Chicago front office is in the midst of a long-term building plan. Castillo was one of the first new pieces put into place when he took the reins as the Cubs’ everyday catcher in August. He batted .294 with 13 extra-base hits and 18 RBI over 41 games in August and September. There’s certainly concern about his contact rate, as Castillo struck out in 30% of his at-bats. However, you need to pause and celebrate his .422 BABIP during that two-month period. Castillo posted a double-digit home run count in four of his five complete minor league seasons. Travis d’Arnaud, Mets - The former top prospect in Toronto came over as part of the R.A. Dickey trade. d’Arnaud batted .333 with 39 extra-base hits (16 home runs) and 52 RBI in 63 games for Las Vegas in the Pacific Coast League. He’s a former first-round pick of the Phillies who has demonstrated strong gap power through six minor league seasons. The missing piece of the equation is d’Arnaud’s low walk rate (one per 14 plate appearances). The current state of the New York lineup and low expectations for the squad dictate that a shift to a young player with great upside will be in the offing. John Buck is not that player. So, while d’Arnaud may start the season in Triple-A, I believe that he’s a fantasy force at the position as the season progresses. Derek Norris, A's - Norris batted an anemic .201 in 60 games last season with a frightening strikeout rate (31.6% of his at-bats). Despite his low batting average, Norris did present solid output in several categories. Norris produced 16 extra-base hits (seven home runs) with 34 RBI and five stolen bases. Looking through his minor league career, the 23-year-old Norris (he’ll turn 24 on Valentine’s Day) has twice hit at least 20 home runs and twice stole more than 10 bases. Norris’ strikeout rate is concerning, and regular at-bats in Oakland (and on the road in Seattle) will turn home runs into doubles and outs. There’s still enough to intrigue me as a back-end C2. Victor Martinez. Tigers - This is less of a ""sleeper"" and more of a reminder. VMart sat out the entire 2012 season with a torn ACL and this year joins a stacked Detroit line-up. He'll bat in the company of Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder, and Torii Hunter. In 2011, Victor led all catchers in hits (178), doubles (40), RBI (103), and batting average (.330). Since 2005, when he plays in at least 120 games (almost 4 ABs per game), Martinez averages 96 RBI, 19 HR, and 170 hits per season. He's in the midst of a baserunning program now and trainers say he'll be ready for Opening Day. Ryan Doumit, Twins - When you think of a catcher in Minnesota , Doumit probably isn't your first choice. But, he hit a career high 18 home runs, more than Joe Mauer (10) last season. The Twins won't be contending for an AL Central title in 2013, so Ryan can just focus on getting more and more reps in a starters role. The stat that I look for in a quality catcher is games played. Obviously, human backstops can't play all 162 games, even when they have the option to DH or play first base, but Doumit played in a career high 134 games and finished ninth in GP out of all other catchers. Plus, while he doesn't have eligibility in the OF or DH spot yet, all it takes is 10 starts, adding versatility to your roster. Salvador Perez, Royals - Full disclosure: I'm a big fan of this guy. I thought he would be successful in 2012 and then Perez missed 86 games with a knee injury. After the All-Star break, Sal concluded the season in the top 10 of catchers in hits, runs, and RBI. He's played in 115 official MLB games since 2011. In that duration his career numbers include a .311 avg, 60 RBI (about an RBI every 2 games), and 14 HRs. After the regular season, Sal returned home and played in the Venezuelan League and won Rookie of the Year. Depending on your league setting, owners should draft only one catcher. Perez will probably be one of the last taken and finish as one of the best.",Raw Data

Now that the election is over, I can finally admit I screwed up in the first debate because I spent most of my preparation time reading your football columns. Michelle prints them out and saves them for me. Regards, Here are your week 10 NFL Truths: 10. Matt Ryan and the Falcons are not frauds. Matt Ryan belongs in the MVP race. But Matt Ryan is the reason I don’t believe the Falcons will reach the Super Bowl. For my money, there’s something missing with Matt Ryan. I can’t put my finger on it exactly. I just know when I watch him, I don’t believe I’m watching a Super Bowl quarterback. He’s not overrated. He’s just not as good as he should be. Think about it. No QB has a better supporting cast. Julio Jones, Roddy White and Tony Gonzalez are the best receiving trio in the league. Hell, they might form the best receiving trio in league history. Gonzalez is going to the Hall of Fame. Jones has Hall of Fame talent. White is on pace to finish with Hall of Fame numbers. Atlanta also has a dangerous running game led by Michael Turner. Matt Ryan is blessed with every weapon imaginable. Plus, he gets to play half his games inside a dome. He has the necessary tools to challenge Tom Brady’s 50-TD, 8-INT season. Yet Ryan is on pace for 34 TDs and 12 INTs. He’s averaging just 7.9 yards per pass attempt. There’s something missing. This is not a rip job. Ryan has been terrific in the clutch. I’d name him MVP of the league right now. But it’s my belief he’ll get beat in the playoffs — thanks to a critical INT or two — by one of the thoroughbred NFC QBs (Aaron Rodgers, Eli Manning) or the 49ers. 9. Can we please fix the NFL’s pass-interference rules? Please! This is my annual plea for the league to address the biggest problem in professional football. Pass interference is the most difficult judgment call in all of sports. Receivers are sprinting full speed down the field and middle-age men are chasing after them trying to determine if illegal contact stopped the receiver from catching the ball. It’s a guessing game and too many refs are guessing wrong. We need to help them by making pass interference subject to replay. And we need to help by having flagrant and non-flagrant pass-interference calls. Flagrant would be a spot-of-the-foul penalty. Non-flagrant would be a 10-yard penalty. 8. My sleeper pick for MVP is Big Ben Roethlisberger. On Sunday, Roethlisberger beat the Giants and the worst officiating crew since Green Bay-Seattle. Big Ben is my favorite NFL player. He’s the modern-day John Elway. Roethlisberger is never going to put up Peyton Manning-like stats. But Roethlisberger is a winner. His willingness and ability to hang in the pocket, move around in the pocket and deliver the ball downfield is unmatched. Pittsburgh’s more conservative, dink-and-dunk offense has Big Ben on pace for the best season of his illustrious career. He’s completing 67 percent of his passes and has thrown just four interceptions. There are a lot of good candidates for MVP: Peyton Manning, JJ Watt, Matt Ryan. Let’s add Big Ben to the list of contenders. In my opinion, he’s leading the best team in football. 7. I’ve always believed Mike Shanahan got too much credit for riding John Elway’s coattails to two Super Bowl victories. Shanahan has never been one of my favorite coaches. But he needs another year with Robert Griffin. It’s too early to give up on Shanahan, even though he’s ready to give up on the Redskins. Frustration and embarrassment made Shanahan announce he was ready to start evaluating the 2012 Redskins based on how they fit into the 2013 season. Shanahan’s record in Washington is 14-27. That’s not good. What’s worse is his employment of his son as offensive coordinator. There are reasons to sour on Shanahan. However, a coaching change and new system could stunt RG3’s development. 'Skins fans should be patient and give Shanahan one more season. 6. Two AFC West teams, San Diego and Kansas City, likely will try to land Andy Reid once he’s fired. Make no mistake, Reid deserves to be fired in Philadelphia. The juvenile decision to fire defensive coordinator Juan Castillo and promote Todd Bowles is a fireable offense. But what should really get Reid fired is his insistence on being a pass-first team with a makeshift offensive line and an undersized quarterback. With LeSean McCoy and rookie Bryce Brown, the Eagles should be a run-first, play-action-pass offense. Reid has a great reputation among football media. He won a lot of regular-season games and a few playoff games during the Donovan McNabb era. Reid will be an attractive coaching candidate when he’s dumped in Philly. Coaching changes in KC and San Diego seem inevitable at this point. Both organizations believe they have playoff talent and will want an experienced coach who can win right now. 5. Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli whined during a one-on-one interview with KC sports anchor and Hall of Fame QB Len Dawson that expectations in Kansas City were too high. Yes, Chiefs fans were delusional for thinking that in Year 4 of Pioli’s rebuilding plan that the Chiefs would hold a lead in the first half of the season. Expectations were just too high! Eight games in and the Chiefs have yet to lead a game in regulation play. They beat the Saints in overtime. Pioli has hired two head coaches in KC: Todd Haley and Romeo Crennel. Haley was in over his head trying to serve as head coach and offensive coordinator. This week, Crennel finally acknowledged he was in over his head trying to serve as head coach and defensive coordinator. It will be interesting to see if owner Clark Hunt allows Pioli a third strike. 4. My money is on Sean Payton leaving the Saints for the Cowboys for $10 million a year. I think the Cowboys have better personnel than the Saints. New Orleans’ god-awful season is about more than Payton’s absence. Payton is an offensive guru. He can’t fix the Saints' defense. Jerry Jones has that brand-new stadium to fill. Paying Payton $10 million to fill it is a bargain. Payton will help Tony Romo reach his potential. Payton is a cult figure in New Orleans. It will be tough to leave. But he brought the city a Super Bowl. He’s already repaid New Orleans for its loyalty. 3. I’ve never been offended by good-natured food jokes, so I wasn’t remotely upset by Terry Bradshaw’s “chasing chicken” quip as he talked over a Reggie Bush highlight. Bradshaw says his comment was directed at colleague Jimmy Johnson, who likes to eat fried chicken on Sundays before NFL games. I accept Bradshaw’s explanation. But I also don’t really care who the comment was directed at. There was no malicious intent. This wasn’t Fuzzy Zoeller trying to demean Tiger Woods’ victory at the Masters. This wasn’t Howard Cosell screaming look at the “little monkey” run. Bradshaw was trying to be funny and said something stupid and harmless. It’s just not a big deal. I don’t get the whole food thing. Just about everyone I know — regardless of color — loves chicken, especially fried chicken. Hell, baked chicken is pretty healthy. I try to eat it three or four times a week. OK, I’m a foodie. But I’ll never understand the hurt feelings about food jokes. 2. I absolutely loved the way Les Miles coached his football team on Saturday. The Mad Hatter is often criticized for taking too many chances and coaching foolishly. Last week, he tried several high-risk plays in an attempt to upset No. 1 Alabama. None of Miles’ trick plays or gambles paid off. Alabama came from behind and won in the closing minute. So what? It was an instant classic. Miles’ throw-the-kitchen-sink coaching style inspired his team to stand toe-to-toe with the best college team in the country. That’s the right way to lose to Nick Saban and Alabama. 1. As of right now, the Colts and the Broncos both made the right decisions this offseason. Andrew Luck has the Colts at 5-3. Peyton Manning has the Broncos at 5-3. Colts owner Jim Irsay and Denver president John Elway both made the right decisions for their franchises. Maybe we will be saying the same thing about the Rockets and the Thunder by the midpoint of the NBA season?",Raw Data
557,"The 17-year-old from Vail, Colorado produced a superb performance to win the women's slalom title at the World Ski Championships in Austria on Saturday. (CNN) -- Seventeen-year-old American Mikaela Shiffrin produced a stunning second run to claim the women's slalom title at the World Ski Championships in Schladming, Austria on Saturday. The slalom princess, as Shiffrin has become known, was in third place after the first run but skied to the top of the podium with a rapid second, clocking an aggregate time of one minute 39.85 seconds, 0.22 ahead of Austria's Michaela Kirchgasser with Sweden's Frida Hansdotter finishing in third. ""I was nervous up until I went out of the start ... but when I got in the start, I felt alive and ready to race,"" she added. The teenager from Vail, Colorado arrived at her first world world championships in top form. She won her first World Cup race in Sweden in December and followed it up with victories in Croatia and Austria last month. At 17 years, 340 days, Shiffrin is the youngest winner of the women's slalom world title since Liechtenstein's Hanni Wenzel in 1974. ""It's been a pretty amazing experience. I was thinking so many things. It was one of those times when everything was a blur and that's when you know it's good. I've been taking it day by day and right now I'm just taking it second by second."" Finland's Tanja Poutianen finished fourth while Slovakia's Tina Maze -- who took gold in the Super-G and silver in the Giant Slalom -- finished fifth. Shiffrin's victory is the U.S.'s fourth of the championships -- adding to Ted Ligety's wins in the Super-G, the Giant Slalom and the Super Combined -- and consolidates their place at the top of the medal's table with a total of four gold and one bronze. France are currently lying second with two golds -- Marion Rolland in the Downhill and Tessa Worley in the Giant Slalom -- one silver and one bronze.",Raw Data
558,"Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com. He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. The Yankees’ newfound mantra of fiscal responsibility – a $189 million payroll in 2014, not a penny more – has stifled a number of potential moves this winter, including their willingness to meet the Diamondbacks’ price for the two-time All-Star. The Yankees indeed want to add a right-handed hitter but haven’t picked up their pursuit of Upton in the days since he was nearly dealt to Seattle, according to major-league sources. The Diamondbacks and Mariners had a deal in place last week, but Upton rejected the move to Seattle by using his limited no-trade clause. Upton is eminently available on the trade market despite finishing fourth in the National League Most Valuable Player voting in 2011. His relationship with the organization seemed to sour last year, and the Diamondbacks have discussed trades with multiple teams throughout the offseason. Now that Seattle has been eliminated as a suitor – for now, at least – the Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers are seen as Upton’s most likely destinations. Meanwhile, the Yankees apparently don’t have the appetite for the three years and $38.5 million left on Upton’s contract – a somewhat startling development for what has been baseball’s richest franchise. Follow the latest baseball moves with our transaction tracker. While the Yankees have a full complement of starting outfielders – Brett Gardner, Curtis Granderson and Ichiro Suzuki – they could clear a spot for Upton by trading Granderson, who will become a free agent after the 2013 season. (Granderson will earn $13 million this year, compared to $9.75 million for Upton.) The Mariners, rebuffed by trade targets and big free agents all offseason, might jump at the chance to get Granderson – even if it’s only for one year. Or they could request a window to negotiate a contract extension as a condition of any deal for Granderson, as happened with R.A. Dickey and the Toronto Blue Jays. The Yankees could ask for a better prospect package – perhaps comparable to the one Seattle was prepared to surrender for Upton – if Granderson agreed to an extension in Seattle. In fact, the Yankees could ask for some of the same Mariners prospects that would have gone to Arizona for Upton. And then the Yankees could repackage that talent – maybe adding another player of their own, if necessary – to bring Upton to the Bronx. (Upton’s no-trade clause reportedly wouldn’t allow him to block a deal to the Yankees.) As logical as that may sound, it isn’t likely to happen as long as the Yankees insist on maintaining payroll flexibility for the coming crunch of 2014. That’s why four of their free-agent signings – Kuroda, Andy Pettitte, Kevin Youkilis and Mariano Rivera – were for one year only. So it seems likely that their right-handed outfield bat will be a reasonably-priced, short-term acquisition such as free agent Scott Hairston, rather than the more impactful Upton.",Raw Data
559,"MELBOURNE—Tennis classics come in all shapes and sizes. On Sunday Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka, two pros from different countries and of similar ages, put each other through a supreme test of skill and stamina; their round-of-16 matchup was a five-hour exhibition of the sport at its finest. Compared to that, Sloane Stephens’ 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 quarterfinal win over Serena Williams today was a very different type of epic. It wasn’t about excellence, and it won’t be remembered for its high quality of play. This match between fellow African-American women a decade apart in age was a psychological drama as only tennis can stage them. It had been billed in the press as mentor vs. protégé. First we heard that Serena was Sloane’s idol growing up. Then we heard about the poster Stephens had of her on her wall, and the way that Serena had helped her, only to show her the back of her hand in their first match, two weeks ago in Brisbane. It took Chris Clarey of the New York Times to remind us today that Sloane hadn’t originally been inspired to pick up a racquet because of Serena, after all. A little later, Matt Cronin of TENNIS.com reported that the two had met for the first time only a year ago, for four minutes, and that Stephens didn’t think Serena had any idea who she was. “I always love watching her play,” said Stephens, who couldn’t remember the first time she had seen Serena on TV, “but I never tried to copycat or anything like that.” “Honestly, I’ve never really given her advice,” Serena said. On camera, their handshake at the end looked like a touching moment of respect; in the future it might even be described as a passing of the American tennis torch. But according to Stephens it wasn’t anything special. Asked what she said to Serena, Sloane shrugged and said, “Good match, well played. I say the same thing every time. She just said good match. I don’t even remember, honestly.” Still, there really was a good story behind this match, and it involved more than these two women. A lot of tennis in recent years has been about young players not measuring up to the game’s stars. We saw it again this week when 31-year-old Roger Federer straight-setted Bernard Tomic and Milos Raonic, each a decade or so younger than him, in successive rounds. On both the men’s and women’s sides, we’ve wondered for a long time when the next generation would finally show up. While Serena was hurt today—she aggravated a back injury in the second set—19-year-old Sloane Stephens showed up, and measured up. We haven’t felt the shock of the new for a long time. It was nice to be reminded of what kind of buzz it can create. “Look dude, like, you can do this. Like, go out and play and do your best.” That’s what Stephens, a California teen through and through, said she told herself this morning before the match. For a set and two games, though, it looked like she wasn’t going to do her best after all. She matched Serena in power, and held serve easily to 3-3. But soon she was backing up and letting her elder do the dictating. That’s how it went until Serena was up 6-3, 2-0. To that point, Stephens had looked tentative and unsure of herself in Rod Laver Arena. After shanking a ball, she stared toward her players’ box in confusion. But something clicked at 0-2 in the second; she appeared to set the doubts aside. Stephens held and then put together her best attacking tennis of the match to break for 2-2. Now she was the one playing closer to the baseline, and Serena was doing the running. “I went down 2-0,” Stephens said, “and I was like, Hmmm, this is not the way you want it to happen....From then on, I got aggressive, started coming to the net more, and just got a lot more comfortable.” It was all downhill from there for Serena. What had appeared to be another routine win was soon spinning out of her control. When Stephens began to play better in the second set, Serena became tentative. Things went from bad to much worse when she was serving at 3-4. Serena ran forward for a drop shot and let out a scream as she swung. “I totally locked up after that,” she said of her back. As Serena’s body was locking up, though, so was Stephens’ mind. Faced with an injured opponent and a chance to beat a 15-time Grand Slam champ, she couldn’t put the ball in the court. Again, though, Sloane rescued herself just in time. Down break point at 5-5, she cracked an inside-out forehand winner, held, and won the next game for the set. That theme, of Stephens appearing to falter before facing up to the moment, would play out in the third set as well. The two went back and forth, trading winners and errors and service breaks, until Stephens served at 4-4. Serena, still moving gingerly, threw caution to the wind and connected on two big winners to reach break point. It looked like the story had finally ended, in the way that we thought it would. But Stephens took the punch and threw one right back, with a forehand winner of her own. It was Serena, it would turn out, who was out of answers. She was the one who collapsed at the end, losing her serve and the match with four listless errors in the final game. “I don’t think my level was high,” Serena said later. This was her first loss since last August, and first at a major since the French Open. “I mean, you can tell. You each can say this is definitely not my best match in months.” As for her assessment of Stephens, Serena thought she had played well, and she didn’t excuse the defeat by citing her injury. But there was a backhanded quality to the compliments she had for the teenager’s game. “She’s a good player,” Serena said. “She runs fast and she gets a lot of balls back. That’s always a plus to have in your career.” Serena's not quite ready to hand over the crown just yet. She's still a competitor, not a mentor. One part of me wants to say that, whatever Serena’s opinion is, the question now isn’t “if” Sloane Stephens is going to win a major, but “when.” And I do think she has major-title potential. But I also don’t think she’s quite there yet. If Serena doesn’t injure herself, Sloane probably loses this match in straight sets. That said, what counts today is what I wrote at the top: Sloane saw that the match was there for the taking, and she took it. Doing that against Serena Williams is plenty for right now.",Raw Data
560,"For all the anticipation surrounding the NBA trade deadline every February, I can’t help but look backward a little bit while everybody else looks forward. Some of the biggest trades the Pistons have ever made have come at or very near the trade deadline and all three of their NBA championships came only after some of those trades. The first deadline trade I remember was one that those of us who were friends of Bob Lanier worried about – and it did happen. Jack McCloskey figured that if he was going to rebuild the team, he almost needed to start from scratch. Bob was sent to Milwaukee for Kent Benson and a No. 1 pick and Kent turned out to be a rock-solid player for the Pistons. He was part of the rebuilding process through the early ’80s and the fact he wasn’t a Hall of Famer like Bob was something nobody held against him. Kent was good for team chemistry. He was a tireless worker and I think his teammates over the years really appreciated what he did. What that trade did for me was let me know that if you have a friend in this business, thicken your skin because he could be traded. That’s probably the first time I started looking at every box score for another team to see how my buddy did. It turned out to be a good trade for Bob, as well. It was hard for him to leave Detroit and he always feels as if he bleeds Pistons blue, but joining Don Nelson over there and playing with a group of guys who became an elite team and competed for conference championships, at least, opened some doors for him at the end of his career. He’s had his number retired in Detroit and Milwaukee. It wasn’t all bad for Bob, either. Those trades shock you early in your career. They don’t shock me as much any more. I remember the Pistons getting Bill Laimbeer a few years after that and what a remarkable trade that was by Jack McCloskey – probably his best. You’re getting an all-time great Detroit Piston, one of the best competitors this game has ever seen and an all-time great teammate who basically was the definition of a winner. They traded him for a group of guys who could play, but Bill had really not had the opportunity in Cleveland, believe it or not, that he was going to get in Detroit. Once he got the opportunity to play major minutes, he made Jack look like a genius. That trade helped the Pistons win two titles. People thought Kenny Carr was the main guy in the deal for the Pistons and I think Jack was going to give Kenny a chance in Detroit. But I think he felt, all the way through it, that Bill Laimbeer was his diamond in the rough and clearly he turned out to be. Carr was dealt away a couple of months after and Bill retired as a Piston and as an all-time great. Fast forward a couple of years, when the Pistons were now one of the very few elite teams, and I’ll never forget the trade that sent Adrian Dantley to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. I think the two people that were hit hardest by that trade were probably yours truly and Joe Dumars, who was AD’s best friend on the team. Those two were huddled up together after it happened at the hotel in Los Angeles. Nobody thought a player who clearly had punched his ticket to the Hall of Fame was going to be traded by a team that nearly won the championship the year before. And, as a matter of fact, if the Pistons had hung on to win in seven games against the Lakers despite Isiah’s horribly sprained ankle and the phantom foul call on Bill Laimbeer to end Game 6, Adrian Dantley would have been MVP of the Finals. As a friend of AD’s, I felt like it had to be a painful for him. It cost him an NBA championship. What the trade did for the Pistons was allow Chuck Daly to finish games with his new defensive stopper at small forward, Dennis Rodman. That was going to be hard to do with one of the great finishers of the decade, Adrian Dantley, on your team. AD was never afraid of the big shot and was happy to go to the free-throw line with the game on the line. Those things never bothered him. Chuck would have been forced to make some tough decisions. Mark Aguirre was a heck of a player. We all know that, and he fit in beautifully with the team, but he also was not the kind of guy who would have been as difficult to take out late in the game for Dennis Rodman. It’s interesting. The Pistons had two future Hall of Fame small forwards on their team before that trade was made: Adrian Dantley and Dennis Rodman. I don’t think there’s much question that the two guys who put together championship rosters in Detroit made their most significant deals around trade-deadline time. We’ve already talked about Jack McCloskey. And let’s not forget one other big deal Trader Jack made at the deadline, the one in 1988 for James Edwards who became such a big part of the two Bad Boys titles. The crown jewel in Joe Dumars’ career as Pistons president of basketball operations is another trade-deadline deal for a big man. It has to be the deal in 2004 for Rasheed Wallace. Everybody that knew anything about Rasheed personally knew that this guy, who was very misunderstood, was a very good teammate and a guy who would do whatever it took to win. Despite gasps from around the league that bringing in Rasheed was rolling the dice, I think Joe knew better. John Hammond, who is now GM in Milwaukee and doing a very good job with the Bucks, told me later that if there was any selfishness on a very unselfish team, it all went away the day Rasheed came in – because he never, ever cared about his own numbers. He only cared about the final score. You could make the case for Rasheed being one of the most talented players in the entire league. When you can add him at the trade deadline, you make your team incredibly better. They needed all five of those great starters to win a title and before they got Rasheed, they only had four of them. The trade didn’t really stop with getting Rasheed, although clearly he was the centerpiece. The Pistons also ended up getting Lindsey Hunter back and Mike James comes in the deal and those two were dogged defenders off the bench. It added more ammunition for a team that already played very good defense. When you look back, that team had such great chemistry. We shouldn’t have been surprised they wound up going all the way, but the whole nation felt the Lakers were top-heavy favorites in the Finals. Those of us who thought the Pistons had a chance – and I would count myself as one of them – would never have predicted what we now call the “five-game sweep.” But I did think with their team chemistry and those really young legs and Larry Brown coaching, even a Phil Jackson team that had Kobe and Shaq and aging veterans like Karl Malone and Gary Payton might have trouble with the Pistons in a seven-game series. It was wild that it didn’t taken seven – and it barely took five. It’s exciting, as I watch this young Pistons team come together around talented players like Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond and Brandon Knight, to think that over the next few seasons, they’ll be in a position to again have a chance for Joe D to pull the trigger on a deal at the deadline that might lead to another championship run.

561,"(CNN) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger knows a thing or two about being an all-action hero -- but it was Austria's Marcel Hirscher who terminated his rivals' hopes at Kitzbuhel. In front of the Terminator star, the current World Cup leader produced an astonishing second run at Sunday's World Cup slalom to clinch victory after finishing third in the opening leg. The home favorite raced home in 53.51 seconds, giving him a winning total of 1min 44.34 seconds to see off Germany's Felix Neureuther and Croatia's Ivica Kostelic. Austrian ace conquered skiing's most feared slope ""I tried my best. It was pretty difficult,"" Hirscher told reporters. ""I knew that if I wanted to win, I definitely had to beat Felix.""

Croatia's Kostelic, who took third, is now guaranteed a record fourth successive victory in the men's World Cup combined event, which takes into account the total of the downhill and slalom times. Kostelic, the overall World Cup winner in 2001, underwent an operation on his troublesome right knee in February 2012 and has been forced to miss large parts of his training. Hirscher stars in Zagreb But the 33-year-old produced an impressive second run Sunday to win the combined event, which will be replaced next season by a super-combined, comprising a shortened downhill and one slalom run ""The course was a little bit different.

563,"From next year the women's team pursuit will add another rider and a further 1,000 metres in the switch to four women over 4,000m but on Thursday night's showing here at the World Track Championships it is unlikely to cause Great Britain even to draw breath. As Laura Trott said after taking gold, it is ""just another kilometre"". The British women have every right to be confident for the future after continuing to dominate the discipline while the fourth rider has already staked her claim. The Olympic champion Joanna Rowsell, a mainstay of the team since 2008, is currently on sabbatical but the Welsh schoolgirl Elinor Barker looks every bit the part on her showing here alongside the London gold medallists Trott and Dani King, as Great Britain's women won their fifth world title in the discipline in six years to go with the Olympic title and world record from last year in London. As for Barker, the 18-year-old from Cardiff is still doing her A-levels in biology and PE, although she has managed only a couple of days in school this year due to her training and the poor weather, and was riding the junior world road race championships less than six months ago – she won gold in the time trial to follow up her silver medal of 2011 – but one would barely have known it. The trio qualified fastest and followed that with a near two-second beating of Australia in the final, in spite of their opponents benefiting from a pair of fresh legs having drafted in Amy Cure to replace Ashlee Ankudinoff. They were seamless rides, with Barker showing ability beyond her years. A cyclist since the age of 10, when she began racing with the Maindy Flyers in Cardiff in order to get out of swimming lessons, Barker will join the GB academy full time when her studies are over. ""She has a good work ethic and, given that she is still in school, obviously she's very organised and she has plenty of ability to go with it,"" was the summary of her coach Paul Manning. ""She's benefited from the input of the Great Britain junior programme and the Welsh programme in Newport with [Welsh head coach] Darren Tudor. They've done well fitting in sessions alongside her school and so on over the winter."" Afterwards Barker had the look of a young woman who could not believe what had hit her. ""Overwhelmed,"" she said, adding that she had attempted to calm herself by imagining she was at a training session in Manchester, and the magnitude of her first senior world title had dawned on her only at the very end. The dominant individual on Thursday was Ireland's Martyn Irvine, who gave his country its best day at any cycling world championships with a silver in the pursuit followed with a gold in the scratch race – a tribute to his drive and determination given that his country has little funding and no indoor velodrome – as well as an extra fillip on the day it was confirmed that Belfast will host the Giro d'Italia start in 2014.",Raw Data

We can ask Hugo (Lloris, Tottenham's former Lyon goalkeeper) the way to go and I think he will be excited about the chance to go back to his old team and play there. ""If we do get Inter if we do get through, two years ago in the Champions League when Gareth Bale got that wonderful hat-trick - that's an exciting game but we have to think about Lyon first."" And Eales believes Villas-Boas has what it takes to lead Spurs to the European title after he engineered a win for former club Porto during a treble-winning first season in charge which saw his side also lift the Portuguese Cup and win the Primeira Liga. ""He's got the pedigree so hopefully he can do what he did with Porto two years ago and we can go al the way to (the final in) Amsterdam,"" he said. ""We want to be playing in European competition. We don't see why we can't have a successful Europa League campaign and do well in the league.""

565,"﻿Even a victory by Daniel Cormier in the final Strikeforce card on Saturday won’t be the heavyweight’s most memorable moment in the soon-to-be-shuttered MMA league. Cormier told FOXSports.com he’d still recall his rookie outing more vividly. “It may not have been my greatest moment, but it was my first,” said Cormier, who is slated to face relative unknown Dion Staring in the co-main event in Oklahoma City. “(Strikeforce founder) Scott Coker for some reason put me on Showtime in my first pro fight. It was the first pro fight for (Gary Frazier) as well. Both of us just went out swinging and we exhausted ourselves by the end of the first round."" Cormier knocked out Frazier in the second round of his debut in September 2009. The former Olympic wrestler has gone on to win his next nine fights -- all but three in Strikeforce -- to become one of the top heavyweight contenders in the world. Strikeforce, an outfit purchased by UFC’s parent company, Zuffa, in 2011, will cease operations after Saturday’s event, which is headlined by the welterweight title bout beween Nate Marquardt and Tarec Saffiedine. Strikeforce has built heavyweights Cormier and Alistair Overeem along with judo-turned-MMA phenomenon Ronda Rousey into bonafied stars. Those three -- among others -- will find a new home in the UFC. Overeem, who regained his license this week after nine-month ban for a violating Nevada’s performance-enhancing drug policy, will resume his UFC career against Antonio Silva at UFC 156 on Feb. 2. Rousey will headline the UFC 157 on Feb. 23, where she is set to face Liz Carmouche in UFC’s first female bout. “A lot of things can happen,” Cormier said. “I don’t really know. I would fight whomever. Ideally, I’d want to fight (Mir).” Understandably, the 33-year-old would love to revisit a bout with Frank Mir. It would be an opportunity to close the door on November 2012 fight that was cancelled due to Mir tearing the meniscus in his knee during training. Cormier also knows who he doesn’t want to fight: UFC heavyweight champ Cain Velasquez. Velasquez, who regained the heavyweight belt with a dominant victory over Junior dos Santos last month, is a teammate and training partner of Cormier’s at San Jose’s American Kickboxing Academy. “Daniel is going to challenge for a title,” AKA founder Javier Mendez said. “That’s going to happen if he stays at heavyweight or goes down to light heavyweight. I think he could drop weight and go after the light heavyweight title. It’s going to be up to Daniel.” First, there’s the weight issue. He needs to get down to 205 pounds to meet the light heavyweight requirement, something Mendez said will take a dietician and a strict workout regimen. Cormier weighed in at 238 for his last fight, a victory via decision over former UFC champ Josh Barnett in May. “The last time I was 205 (pounds) was in 2001,” said Cormier. Still, the odds of him making that cut are much better than the fight odds his upcoming opponent has received. Some sports books have Cormier as a 20-1 favorite against Staring, a Dutch fighter with a 28-7 record compiled in much smaller promotions. “If I was a bookie, I wouldn’t be setting those kinds of odds,” Cormier said. “There should never be such a huge gap, especially when somebody has fought three times as much as I have.” Cormier’s undefeated 10-fight resume may lack a single UFC bout, but that will change in the months ahead. “Strikeforce gave guys like myself an alternative,” said Cormier, who transitioned from freestyle wrestling to MMA less than five years ago. “Some of us weren’t ready to fight in the UFC, but we still were able to train and compete at a high level in Strikeforce. Hopefully, now, we can put on a great show and let people remember it for what it did for all of us.”",Raw Data
566,"Little-known Max Aaron won his first title at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships on Sunday and helped knock down three-time champion Jeremy Abbott to the last step on the podium. With two quadruple jumps and an arsenal's worth of other tricks in his ''West Side Story'' program, don't count the 20-year-old upstart out at the world championships in March, either. ''I kind of thought in the back of my mind he could be the national champion,'' coach Tom Zakrajsek said. ''There are so many great men and you never know how they're going to skate or how it's going to be judged. I did think he gave a performance today - when you give a performance like that, it's worthy of a national title. ''He skated into the title, which is kind of a nice way to earn it.'' Aaron screamed and shook his fists when he finished his program, then slid across the ice giving a Tiger Woods-like fist pump. (He was wearing red, appropriately, and it was Sunday.) ''The goals I had coming into this event were just to complete two clean programs. I didn't think of ever medaling,'' Aaron said. ''But I knew if I completed the programs the way I know I can do them, I knew I could be up there.'' When his marks were posted, Aaron's jaw dropped and the audience roared. He won the free skate in a rout to jump from fourth to first, and finished with 255 points overall, almost four better than Ross Miner. Abbott, who had won three of the last four U.S. titles, dropped to third after a disappointing and flawed free skate. The Americans can only send two men to the world championships, so Abbott will have to watch and hope Aaron and Miner do well enough to get an extra spot for the Sochi Olympics. ''These two men skated brilliantly and they deserve to be in the positions they are,'' Abbott said. ''Not to put any pressure on them, but they better get three spots for next year.'' Aaron was the U.S. junior champ two years ago, but has done little of note since then. He actually considered quitting skating last summer, after he finished eighth at nationals. Skating first of the top men, however, he wasted no time letting everyone know he's got the makings of a champion. He opened with two quadruple salchows, the first in combination with a double toe loop, and did seven triples. Aside from a small turn out on a triple axel, his jumps were done with such great speed and flow people watching at home on their couches were probably saying, ''That doesn't look so hard, I could do that.'' Aaron is more than just a jumping bean, however. His spins were excellent, so fast and tightly centered he was practically a blur. He jazzed up his footwork with high kicks and hops, the kind of flourishes audiences - and judges - love. But it was his perfect portrayal of the bad boy in ''West Side Story'' that was most entertaining. As he heard the first notes of his music, he fixed the audience with a smirk and began snapping his fingers. He oozed attitude throughout the entire program, so much so it's a wonder the Jets didn't storm the ice and try and wipe the smile from his face. ''This wasn't just a performance that happened. This is how he trains,'' Zakrajsek said. ''Our big goal was just to deliver what he trained and see how he fit in.'' Aaron's big score in the free skate - 175.87 - was going to be tough for Abbott, Miner and the rest of the guys to top. No one came close. Miner has quietly developed into one of the most reliable U.S. men, finishing third at the previous two nationals and winning a bronze at this year's NHK Trophy. That's bolstered his confidence, and he's skating with more polish and assertiveness than ever before. Every element in his program, to the old ''Captain Blood'' movie, was finished to perfection. There was no rushing out of jumps or awkward ends to spins. It's the kind of precision a skater has to have if he's to contend with the international crowd. He, too, did a quad salchow - a gorgeous one, to boot - and seven other triple jumps. His only flaw was singling an axel, a silly mistake that's sure to nag at him until next year's nationals. ''The single axel is not what I was looking for, but I'm happy I kept my head in it and fought all the way to the end,'' Miner said. ''It was a good day.'' Not for Abbott, whose program was barely adequate technically for a skater of his caliber. He was so slow on the approach to his quadruple toe it looked as if he was going to stop and, no surprise, he landed on his rear end. But it was his other jumps that were more disappointing. His landings were scratchy and awkward, a shock for a skater who prides himself on his skating skills, including edge quality so fine the carvings could be sold as artwork. He still might have finished ahead of Miner had he not popped his final jump, turning a planned triple salchow into a double. He skated off the ice banging his forehead with his fist. ''Stupid bleeping triple sal,'' Abbott said of what he was thinking. ''When I doubled it, I knew that was going to be the difference. It's the easiest jump in the program, and I let it go. I knew at that point I going to be just enough behind.''",Raw Data

568,"HOUSTON: Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin provided a potent mix of outside shooting and inside dominance to lift the Western Conference to a 143-138 victory over the Eastern Conference in the NBA All-Star game Sunday. Durant scored 30 points and Griffin added 19, on nine-of-11 shooting, but the Most Valuable Player Award went to Chris Paul, who scored 20 points and added 15 assists for the West. Paul told Durant, the NBA’s leading scorer and last year’s All-Star game MVP, to expect to see the ball in his hands. “I told KD early in the first quarter, ‘Man, if they score anything, you run. I’ll get you the ball, you score. I want to be the one to give it to you,’” recalled the Los Angeles Clippers guard. “In games like this it’s so up-tempo and fast paced, a guy like me that’s a facilitator, I enjoy it.” Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks paced the East with 26 points, followed by Miami guard Dwyane Wade, who had 21, and LeBron James, who added 19. Durant hit 13-of-24 shots to lead the West to a third straight victory in the annual showcase that features little defense, a lot of dunks, and plenty of assists for anyone who decides to pass. “I’m just out there having fun,” Oklahoma City forward Durant said. “I played a lot of street basketball. I played a lot of celebrity games. “This is my type of ballgame, up and down.” Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, a three-time MVP of the game, dueled James several times in the fourth quarter and came out on top. James nailed seven-of-18 shots but misfired on all four fourth-quarter attempts. James, a forward with the Miami Heat, said he was not startled to see the smaller Bryant guarding him with the game on the line. “He does it all the time,” James said. “I am absolutely not surprised. It was all in good spirit. It was just two guys that love to compete, love to go at it. It was a lot of fun.” The West held a three-point, fourth-quarter lead but a 25-foot, 3-pointer by Paul, a driving layup by Bryant, and a dunk by Durant pushed the lead to 136-126 with 2:34 left. Anthony said at halftime with the West leading 69-65 his East team mates decided “we were going to go after it.” “Everybody competed,” he said. “We get guys out there of that caliber, they’re going to compete. Nobody likes to lose. “At the end of the day, we’re all basketball players, we’re all competitors,” Anthony added. The sellout Toyota Center crowd of 16,101 roared its approval at the array of alley-oop baskets, sprints to the hoop, and the rim-rattling dunks by Griffin, Paul’s teammate with the Clippers. West coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs praised both teams, saying: “Those guys are the best in the world and they competed and worked hard ... They respected the game. They respected each other. Nobody got hurt.” A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Daily Star on February 19, 2013, on page 14. Tweet Home Basketball",Raw Data
569,"The Washington Redskins quarterback had his knee repaired by orthopedist James Andrews in Florida. The doctor had already diagnosed a torn lateral collateral ligament in his right knee. The person said Andrews also found and repaired damage found in Griffin's ACL. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Redskins had not made an announcement about the latest details surrounding the rookie quarterback's injury. Now comes RG3's next challenge: a race against time to get healthy before the beginning of next season. Griffin's recovery time will take several months at least but could extend into next season, depending on the extent of the damage. The process could also be speeded up because Griffin is known as a focused, determined competitor who would be expected to take his rehab as seriously as possible. ''Thank you for your prayers and support. I love God, my family, my team, the fans, & I love this game. See you guys next season,'' Griffin tweeted before the surgery began. Athletes generally need nine to 12 months to make a full recovery from a torn ACL, although Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson made a remarkable return this season about eight months after tearing an ACL - and nearly broke the NFL's single-season rushing record. Russ Paine, a physical therapist in Houston who worked with Peterson during his rehab, said the running back's timetable for returning to competition was in fact ''pretty traditional.'' ''What's non-traditional is him almost breaking the rushing record,'' Paine said in a phone interview Wednesday. Griffin reinjured his knee at least twice in Sunday's playoff loss to the Seattle Seahawks, prompting a national debate over whether coach Mike Shanahan endangered Griffin's career by not taking the team's franchise player out of the game sooner. The first major injury to the knee came in 2009, when Griffin tore the ACL in the third game of the season while playing for Baylor. Griffin missed the rest of the year but returned in 2010 and won the Heisman Trophy in 2011. Griffin sprained the LCL last month when he was hit by Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata at the end of a 13-yard scramble. Griffin missed one game and returned to play three more while wearing a bulky knee brace, his mobility clearly hindered. Then, on Sunday, Griffin hurt the knee again as he fell awkwardly while throwing a pass in the first quarter against the Seahawks. He remained in the game, with Shanahan saying he trusted Griffin's word that all was OK. Griffin finally departed in the fourth quarter, after the knee buckled while he was trying to field a bad shotgun snap. The No. 2 overall pick in last year's draft, Griffin was one of several rookie quarterbacks to make an instant impact on the NFL this season. He set the league record for best season passer rating by a rookie QB and led the Redskins to their first NFC East title in 13 years. But he also had to leave three games early due to injuries - two because of his knee and one because of a concussion - and missed a fourth altogether because of the knee.",Raw Data

571,"An acrobatic tip-in from a player who has scored all of 49 points in three seasons at Georgetown has put No. 5 Louisville into must-win mode. Aaron Bowen contorted his body enough to guide in the ball after a missed layup by D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera with 3 1/2 minutes to play Saturday, the unlikely winning basket in the Hoyas' 53-51 victory which was the Cardinals' third straight loss. ''I tell l him all the time that he's probably one of the most athletic people on this planet, and when the shot went up, he just came out of nowhere,'' said guard Markel Starks, using the type of hyperbole not usually associated with tight-laced Georgetown. ''And he just, I don't know, he just ... it was unbelievable.'' Coach John Thompson III was rolling his eyes as he listened to that description, but there was plenty that happened Saturday that might have been deemed unbelievable only a couple of weeks ago. A Hoyas team that put up stinkers against South Florida, Marquette and Pittsburgh has now beaten ranked teams Notre Dame and Louisville in consecutive games. And the Hoyas (14-4, 4-3 Big East) are doing it without Greg Whittington, their second-leading scorer on the season. Whittington is sidelined indefinitely due to academic reasons, the main reason that players like Bowen are getting some minutes. ''I'm thinking of suspending a player,'' quipped Louisville coach Rick Pitino, when told that Georgetown is 4-1 without Whittington. Thompson's take? ''We might have been 5-0 with him,'' the coach said. ''He is a loss. It's a big loss. But at the same time we have people that have stepped up and hopefully will continue to step up.'' Meanwhile, the Cardinals (16-4, 4-3) have their longest losing streak since January 2010. No. 1 in the country a week ago, Louisville has fallen to Syracuse, Villanova and Georgetown and has Pittsburgh at home on Monday. ''We have to get this win. It's a must game for us,'' Pitino said. ''Because four (in a row), now you're on the verge of getting a sub-.500 record in the league, and you don't want to mess with that.'' Pitino has plenty to sort out before then. He shook up the lineup by going with Luke Hancock over leading scorer Russ Smith, who is being asked to distribute more and score less after three poor shooting games this month. Also, Peyton Siva got into foul trouble and was held scoreless for the first time since he was a freshman. Siva missed a potential game-winning jumper with 1.4 seconds to play. And there's the ongoing free throw issue. The Cardinals went 12 for 12 from the line in the first half but just 4 for 10 in the second, echoing a problem from recent games. Smith still got his time on the court - he scored 12 points in 29 minutes - but he didn't look fully comfortable in his new role and had only two assists. ''I'm just trying to stay positive about the whole situation and look for my guys,'' he said. ''I didn't get a chance to create my own shot because there are going to be some bad shots, and Coach doesn't want that, so I've just got to get the offensive moving a bit.'' Bowen's basket gave Georgetown a 52-50 lead with 3 1/2 minutes remaining. Louisville's Chane Behanan made 1 of 2 free throws to cut the lead to one with 2:22 to play, and the Cardinals had several chances to take the lead after that, including a disputed held ball that gave them possession again with 30 seconds to play. Louisville dribbled down the court, but Siva's jumper was off target. Georgetown's Otto Porter grabbed the rebound - his 12th of the game - and was fouled. He made 1 of 2 free throws to finish with 17 points. The game had an extra half-minute of action during the second half when play continued while the clock was stopped at 6:07, but the glitch didn't appear to affect the outcome. As for Bowen, he got a spot on the postgame podium after the biggest basket of his college career. Naturally, his cellphone went off while Thompson was speaking. ''See?'' Thompson said. ''AB's not used to coming in here.''",Raw Data
572,"Maya Moore has already made her mark on the WNBA. That means the next question for the league is, what will Brittney Griner bring? By Joan Niesen on December 5, 2012PRINT Maya Moore was late. She ducked into the Minnesota Timberwolves' first preseason game at the Target Center this October just after tip-off, the brim of her black hat pulled low and her 54-year-old mother in tow. It didn't take long for the crowd to notice. Within minutes, an injured Kevin Love had abandoned the Timberwolves bench in favor of a front-row seat along the baseline next to Moore and her mother. At halftime, a line of fans snaked through the aisle; Moore smiled and shook hands and posed for anyone willing to wait. She's a celebrity in Minnesota. Maya Moore: Olympian, starting Lynx forward, household name. Her team won a championship in 2011 and returned to the Finals a year later, eventually falling to the Indiana Fever in four games. But even in defeat, Moore was the most recognizable face of the series. She is, without a doubt, the league's present; its brightest star, its biggest talent. Moore built her celebrity on a 90-game winning streak at UConn, where she established herself as the kind of player so dedicated she'd send texts to her coaches analyzing her shooting at practice, but so down-to-earth she'd fetch teammates water on the bench. She has size and she has strength and she has agility. With her combination of talent, celebrity, and charm, the 23-year-old has garnered a measure of mainstream attention for the WNBA. Now the challenge will be to sustain it. Maya Moore loved the WNBA from the start. She loved it when it was no more than a date on her calendar: June 21, 1997. For her eighth birthday, 10 days before the league's first game, her uncle gave her a pair of regulation-size WNBA basketballs, one outdoor, one indoor. She watched as the New York Liberty beat the Los Angeles Sparks, 67-57, in the league's inaugural game, and when her family moved from Jefferson City, Missouri, to Charlotte the next year and Atlanta after that, she brought her WNBA posters with her. She wore a Comets T-shirt after Houston won the first championship. She took her indoor ball on all her AAU trips. In Atlanta, Moore had no interest in the Hawks. She didn't care about the Braves and — despite spending her youth in Cardinals territory — wasn't interested in St. Louis's storied baseball franchise, either. These days, Maya Moore barely remembers a world without the league for which she is now a star. ""I was a junkie,"" Moore said. ""I was a basketball junkie. I'll admit it."" The same probably goes for Brittney Griner, the 6-foot-8 Baylor phenom projected to be the no. 1 overall pick in April's WNBA draft whose overpowering, aggressive game is hard to ignore.1 (Here are your obligatory links to Griner dunk videos.) But besides their shared obvious talent, Griner is nothing like Moore. She's eight inches taller, with size and skills that make Moore appear a mere mortal in a world where she's been exalted for half a decade. From the moment of tip-off, it seems, many opponents provide no challenge whatsoever for Griner. Maybe they're intimidated. Or maybe Griner is so tall, so strong, so capable that to line up against her is to render oneself irrelevant. What Griner does on the court, she does on a scale unprecedented in the women's game. To watch her play is to see a human grenade explode; she's coiled and streamlined and aerodynamic until that moment when she throws all of her 208 pounds at the basket and unleashes, a mess of arms and legs going everywhere. If Griner is a grenade, Moore is a sniper. She sees her target without the obstructions, without the players lurking in front of her. She drops a shoulder, spins, lunges, a different machination every time to trick a defender and somehow arc the basketball precisely where it needs to be. Footwork and instincts make the process look far easier than it is, and though she doesn't dunk — at least not in games — Moore does what she does so precisely as to make everyone around her just a bit duller by comparison. Although we're months away from Griner's WNBA debut, and Baylor's season is already marred with an early 71-69 loss to Stanford,2 the spotlight has begun to move from Minneapolis to Waco. Yes, Moore inked an endorsement deal with Nike's Jordan Brand, the first female basketball player to do so. She was the catalyst behind the Lynx's jump from second-worst in the league in 2010 to champions one year later. But now, less than two years into her professional career, Moore has become more of an institution than a sensation. She's still on pace to develop into one of the very best in WNBA history, but it's clear Griner is the next best thing. Really, even that might not be completely accurate. Brittney Griner might not be just the next best thing. She might be the best thing. Period. Cooper Neill/Getty ImagesIt's not a question of whether these two superstars can coexist in the WNBA, but rather whether the WNBA can finally capitalize on them. Since her Baylor team won its championship in April, talk of Griner's entry into the league next summer has escalated. She's Maya Moore 2.0, her name synonymous with basketball above the rim. But don't sleep on Griner's defensive acumen. Her 88-inch wingspan is as long as Anthony Davis's, and her grip is bigger than LeBron's. ""She just changes what open is,"" Moore said. ""Offensively, you can do a few things to try to maybe push her off of her comfort zone, just like any good player, but then you kind of have to hope she misses. But defensively, it's more 'What do you do with that?' You think you're open, and then she takes two steps and you're not open."" Moore entered the league with monumental hype. On April 12, the day after the draft, 38,154 fans at Target Field watched a propeller plane circling overhead, trailing a banner that read: ""WELCOME MAYA MOORE LYNX OPENER JUNE 5."" And that was just the beginning. The team developed ""Maya plans,"" including covering an entire wall of the Minneapolis skyway with facts about Moore and her career; special season-ticket packages; custom T-shirts; and plenty of plays on ""getting Moore."" Some version of that will be true in Phoenix — whose Mercury hold the no. 1 pick in the 2013 WNBA draft and are expected to select Griner — and such efforts will be necessary. Griner will enter the league on the heels of a season in which her Baylor team appeared on national television in 10 of its regular-season games; it's unlikely she'll get that kind of exposure in the WNBA. But it's not as if Griner hasn't pushed her team's popularity before; last season Baylor twice set school attendance records and recorded three advance sellouts for the first time in the program's history. Moore's Lynx have increased their appearances on ABC and ESPN networks from one in 2011 to four in 2012, and Griner should have a similarly large impact in Phoenix. The Lynx's gains have been good by WNBA standards, but can Griner be the catalyst of a bump in attendance and exposure that's not qualified within that niche market? Before Moore, there was Candace Parker. Before Parker, Diana Taurasi. They were the queens of college ball before becoming the WNBA's marketing gold, though none had the fanfare of Moore when she arrived in the league. Each has cultivated a personality as a pro: Parker as something of a sex symbol, Taurasi as the villain, both as talented, chippy players known to mouth off and tussle on the court. But platforms for their celebrity were few. In fact, this line of college stars whose fame faded when they turned pro goes back to the early days of the league, when Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke came into the league with three Olympic medals between them and went on to win a combined four WNBA titles, but the league still failed to capitalize on their success. ""I think it's always a case of the latest is the greatest,"" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. ""Whoever is the most recent and most successful in people's minds is who people perceive as the most marketable person."" But the popularity of Moore, Parker, and the rest hasn't grown precipitously since they left school, and they, especially Moore, are still best known for what they did at the collegiate level. There's no reason to believe Griner won't follow a similar pattern; she's different from every other player, yes, but is she different enough to steer her own course? In October, Auriemma caused a stir when he suggested lowering the rims in the women's game. There's no question that Auriemma wants what's best — his career hinges on it, after all — and the proposal was clever, too. (He suggested dropping the 10-foot rim by 7.2 inches, which would honor Title IX's 1972 institution.) The idea sparked chatter, but Auriemma, the godfather of the women's game, is hardly the first to publicly and dramatically suggest ways to fix it. For example: In 2003, a group of businessmen affiliated with the Mohegan Sun casino purchased the Orlando Miracle and brought the team north to Connecticut, where they figured throngs of UConn fans would love a professional franchise. The new owners moved the Sun (as they renamed the team) into a smaller arena, and in 2010, it became the first-ever WNBA team to turn a profit. Although the move to independent, rather than NBA-affiliated, ownership sparked a trend (five more franchises followed suit), no other team has adopted the scaled-down venue. What the Sun set in motion shouldn't be taken lightly. WNBA president Laurel Richie adamantly believes the league should be treated as a separate entity from the men's league. She's even known to drop ""NBA"" from its name, instead calling it ""The W"" in an apparent attempt to emphasize women. Yeah, it sounds like the hotel chain, but at least she's trying — and she might have the right idea. This isn't just a summer extension of the NBA, and focusing on what makes it different might be the WNBA's best battle cry. So no, the rest of the league hasn't adopted the Sun's scaled-down version of the game, and there's been no consensus in response to Auriemma's grand scheme. To properly execute what he's suggesting would involve top-down coordination, and it's the kind of last-ditch effort that would be a long time in the making. Regardless, there's no question that some kind of change is coming, good or bad, and even the most radical ideas might be worth something. Another game-changer just might be Griner. The year before she arrived at Baylor, the Bears scored an average of 69.3 points per game, giving up 57.4. By last season, those numbers had improved to 78.4 and 52.1. The stats only tell part of the story, though. Griner outplays and outmatches her opponents to the point that it's easy to feel sorry for them. Despite that kind of transformative dominance, though, Griner is just one player on one team, and Moore, for what it's worth, couldn't care less about this vague notion of change. ""What does that actually mean?"" she said. ""The league is pretty cool if you watch the games right now. I don't know what you want to change."" When Maya Moore won her 90th consecutive game at UConn, it was hard to imagine anyone being better. When Griner dunked and stomped her way to a championship last spring, the same was true. The stage is set for a new focus in women's basketball — the most dominant rivalry the WNBA has seen yet. Moore and Griner haven't faced off since November 16, 2010, when top-ranked UConn faced no. 2 Baylor in a rematch of the previous season's national semifinal.3 UConn won, 65-64, before a packed crowd of 12,628 at the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut. Moore finished the night with 30 points, responsible for nearly half her team's scoring. Griner had 19 points and nine blocked shots. Take one of those swats, Griner's fifth, near the end of the first half. She barely left the ground as she batted the ball down. It was effortless. But as quickly as the ball took a high bounce to her left, there was Moore, out of nowhere, tipping it into the basket with her left hand. Then later, with UConn trailing by eight and with about seven minutes remaining, Moore drove to the basket. Baylor guard Jordan Madden trailed her as she lunged into the paint, and suddenly there was Griner, looming and ready. Moore took the shot anyway. She drew a foul, cut into Baylor's lead, and — perhaps most important — made Griner look like any other defender. Fourteen points later, the win was Moore's, UConn's winning streak was intact, and Griner's masterful work was undone by one of the few players who had figured out how to do so. That show is coming to the WNBA in a matter of months, and really, who wouldn't want to watch it?

573,"Jason Whitlock writes about the sports world from every angle, including those other writers can't imagine or muster courage to address. His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. It wasn’t that long ago, in the aftermath of Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor’s tragic death in 2007, that I was the toast of right-wing America. Before there were any arrests, before we knew the gruesome circumstances that precipitated his murder, I analogized Taylor’s assailants to the Black KKK in a column for FOXSports.com. I’m fond of provocative analogies. That affinity bit me in the rear end Monday morning. In the aftermath of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher’s murder-suicide, during an interview with Roland Martin on the popular Tom Joyner morning radio show, I groggily and inarticulately popped off a provocative analogy that I had yet to explain in writing. I analogized the National Rifle Association to the KKK. Big mistake. My views on the NRA and distaste for the organization cannot be explained at 4:30 a.m. (I live in LA) during a fast-paced interview on a morning radio show. My column is the foundation for all of my most provocative opinions. My podcast is my secondary foundation for those opinions. I prefer to control my message and not hand fragments of my thoughts over to others to exploit, recast and define. I like to be interviewed about what I wrote in my column and what I said during my podcast. Through no fault of Roland Martin or Tom Joyner, I went off message early Monday morning and spewed a half-baked thought. And by doing so, I gave the right-wing entertainment media the out it needed to further bastardize the rather harmless column I wrote Saturday night about Belcher’s murder-suicide. The column primarily focused on my belief that it was inappropriate for the Chiefs to play a game 28 hours after Belcher murdered his live-in girlfriend and then drove to the Chiefs practice facility and killed himself in front of the general manager, head coach and defensive coordinator. Kansas City’s victory over the Carolina Panthers, nor the KC players’ insistence on wanting to play, in no way invalidates my contention that the NFL was wrong for playing the game as scheduled. The column whined that football is our God and not even murder-suicide will slow us from worshipping at its altar. The still-in-shock and desensitized-to-violence players and coaches turned Belcher’s locker into a game-day shrine. Jovan Belcher is a murderer. His suicide did not transform him into a fallen hero. There was one primary reason my Saturday-night column focused on whether the game should be played. I didn’t know what else to write. At the time, there was little concrete information about the tragedy. I wrapped up my column with an ancillary point articulating my belief that America’s gun culture is out of control, dangerous and a threat to our liberty. I further argued that our Second Amendment is outdated. The right to bear arms no longer protects us from a government armed with stealth bombers, predator drones, tanks, nuclear weapons and all the other knickknacks James Madison and Co. couldn’t envision when ratifying the Bill of Rights in 1791. Bob Costas quoted and paraphrased my ancillary point during a courageous halftime commentary on NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.” He infuriated the right-wing entertainment media and gave Bill O’Reilly and his disciples the opening to pretend the Second Amendment is under some sort of serious attack. It is not. We just finished a hotly contested election cycle, and not one political candidate that I can think of uttered a single meaningful word about gun violence, gun control, gun culture and the outdatedness of the justification for the Second Amendment. This issue is so dead in this country that the flag-waving, right-wing entertainment media have to drag up a non-political, non-voting sports columnist and a talented sports broadcaster as their straw men to justify their phony outrage. I don’t think I’ll be called before the Senate to speak on any toothless gun-control legislation the NRA lobby lets slip through a crack. But it appears I was summoned to testify before Speaker of The Big House Bill O’Reilly, the FOX News entertainer. O’Reilly is fixated on the mistake I made on the Tom Joyner show. O’Reilly spent part of his Tuesday show telling his viewers that I was afraid to come on “The Factor” and discuss my views on the NRA, the Second Amendment and gun culture. I’m a grown-ass man and it’s 2012. I don’t have to shuffle off to the Big House when summoned. O’Reilly is not Boehner, Pelosi or Obama. He’s a TV entertainer who has spent the weeks after the election crying about the end of “white establishment” America, the end of the days when an upstanding white man felt entitled to summon whomever he wanted whenever he wanted to the Big House to dance. Every cable TV network requested that I consent to an interview this week. I declined all invitations. Only Speaker of the Big House O’Reilly attacked me for exercising my constitutional right of freedom. It’s been a tough week for me personally, and I chose to control my message by using my platforms — column and podcast. Beginning with my defense of Don Imus during the Rutgers controversy, I’ve appeared on O’Reilly’s program several times. You typically sacrifice two hours of time for an eight-minute segment that accomplishes very little. It’s not the deep end of the pool. There’s no room for someone like me to splash around. If O’Reilly wants to talk, he’s more than welcome at my little house. I’d love to tape a podcast with him discussing the Second Amendment, gun culture and his fears about the end of white establishment America. For now, I’m going to stick to writing my sports column. And when given a chance to broaden sports issues into social issues I will take that opportunity. That’s what I do. And I do it without giving much thought to which politically partisan group I’m pissing off. When Taylor was senselessly murdered, I lambasted the primarily black ""gangsta"" culture that preys on black people the way the KKK once did. I’m not paid to state the obvious. I’m paid to provoke thought, be compelling and explore the bigger picture. It doesn’t require much intellectual heft to point out Belcher is responsible for his reprehensible tragedy. Recognizing his culpability for his girlfriend’s murder and moving on to make a deeper, more nuanced point isn’t irresponsible or an effort to excuse Belcher’s gross criminality. It’s a bid to probe alternative remedies that might lessen the probability of another Belcher tragedy. History has taught us that human beings are flawed, volatile, irresponsible and violent. What can we do to safely manage these human characteristics beyond the obvious? I believe we should re-examine our love affair with guns. They don’t protect us from tyranny. Guns are toys in America. Guns are a dangerous hobby. Guns are a macho accessory, no different from a shiny sports car. We can’t see this or even have a discussion about it because the propaganda-political-lobby-machine, the NRA, has hoodwinked America into believing handguns make us safer. The NRA, like the KKK, has brainwashed us through fear and division. I don’t believe individual NRA members and/or gun owners — and I’m quite aware the NRA has members of every race — are racist. I do believe the NRA capitalizes on and promotes racial fears and ignorance that swings all directions. People of every race are buying guns to “protect” themselves from their own race or other races. It’s an unhealthy arms race. The NRA is powering it by promoting unnecessary and harmful stand-your-ground laws. The message isn’t subtle: Strap up, the other guy is out to get you. The NRA traffics in fear, division and the seductive power of guns — the same tools used by the KKK. Other than money, I don’t think the NRA has a dog in the race. It just wants all sides armed to the hilt and convinced the other side is ready to shoot. That’s the recipe that left a 17-year-old Jacksonville kid dead over loud music blaring from a car. It’s a dangerous recipe that I believe is fracturing our imperfect union. Nations as big and powerful as ours die from internal — not external — wounds. We’ve been duped into believing handguns are our salvation, an expression of our American patriotism. They’re just the opposite. Their rising popularity pushes us closer and closer to the brink, closer to a war inspired by racial divisions. To much fanfare and derision, I’ve written provocatively about black people’s adoption of KKK-like qualities. I’ve bitched rather loudly and passionately about gangsta, hip-hop culture. I don’t run my opinions or analogies through a political point of view before airing them. I’m not part of the right- or left-wing entertainment media. I’m just a sports writer spouting my opinions trying to get you to look at the world differently. If you read me long enough, it’s inevitable I’m going write something you passionately disagree with. But the opinions expressed in this column don’t come from a dishonest or partisan place.",Raw Data
574,"Trouble in Texas Pistons lose road-trip finale as Ginobili leads San Antonio burst by Keith Langlois, Pistons.com | @Keith_Langlois TEAM COLORS The story of the game in Pistons red, white and blue A brilliant seven-minute run by Manu Ginobili in the first half essentially decided the game, which San Antonio won in a rout, 114-75. When Ginobili entered the Spurs led 12-10 and seconds later, before hed played an offensive possession, Greg Monroes layup tied the game. When Ginobili came out early in the second quarter, the Spurs led 39-23. He scored 15 points in San Antonios 27-11 run and finished the first half with 17 points on just six shots half of them 3-pointers and all of them makes. He didnt score in the second half, but the damage was done. Monroe led the Pistons with 16 points, eight rebounds and four assists in 30 minutes. BLUE COLLAR Not much went right for the Pistons as they trailed by 20 at halftime and by 33 going to the fourth quarter, but Brandon Knight continued to play hard even as the deficit mounted and the bounces werent going his way. Knight, coming off games of 32 and 22 points since returning from the knee injury that cost him three games, finished with eight points, shooting just 3 of 14, but he had six rebounds and six assists. Jonas Jerebko, celebrating his 26th birthday, finished with 10 points and five rebounds. RED FLAG The Pistons were treading water late in the first quarter, enduring a 10-0 Spurs run to snap a 12-all tie, but had a chance to cut their deficit to seven when they forced a turnover and headed the other way with seconds left and numbers in transition. But Brandon Knight was called for a charge, wiping out Jose Calderons attempt at an open corner 3-pointer, and then rookie Khris Middleton fouled Manu Ginobili in the act of making a 3-pointer. That potential seven-point swing a triple Calderon didnt get the chance to take and the four points Ginobili scored meant the Pistons trailed 32-19 after one quarter. SAN ANTONIO If San Antonios hottest pursuers in the West believe the Spurs vulnerable without Tony Parker over the next month, they might want to avoid watching the tape of their Sunday dismantling of the Pistons. It was a clinic tape, Lawrence Frank said after the 114-75 hurting the Spurs applied. You know whats coming but we couldnt stop it. We could have done a whole lot more to put more into the game to give ourselves a chance, but we didnt. Thats a credit to the champs. Thats the blueprint. Thats what it looks like. Nobody has faced a worse confluence of factors here since 100 brave Texans tried to defend the Alamo. The Spurs had a chip on their shoulder from surrendering 119 points to the Pistons last month in a loss at The Palace, San Antonios highest yield in regulation this season. They were still a little chapped about losing at home to lowly Phoenix last week. And they unquestionably wanted to send a loud message to Oklahoma City and the LA Clippers, close on their heels for the NBAs best record and No. 1 seed in the West, that theyd withstand the loss of Parker just as theyve survived the losses of Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili previously. Check, check and check. Ginobili changed the game when he entered with five minutes left in the first quarter and both offenses sputtering. He scored 15 points in a seven-minute spurt, including a back-breaking four-point play to end the first quarter, as the Spurs went on a 27-11 run. They never led by less than double digits after that and kept expanding the lead through halftime and into the fourth quarter. We didnt really come to fight, Charlie Villanueva said. Thats the best team in the league. Especially the fact we beat them the way we did back in Michigan, we knew they were going to come ready to play. Theyre the best team in the league for a reason and we didnt come ready to play. Ginobili scored all 17 of his points in the first half as the Spurs took a 20-point lead into halftime. Ginobilis a great player that goes without saying, Will Bynum said. They beat us bad tonight. The guys a future Hall of Famer, Frank said. But still, we could do better. If the Pistons still had a punchers chance against a team that came into the game with a 23-3 home record when they were down 20 at the break, that chance evaporated in the first 82 seconds of the third quarter when the deficit went to 26. The first three possessions included two Pistons misses inside and one turnover all converted into transition dunks or layups by the Spurs. And the rout was on. San Antonio led by 33 headed to the fourth quarter. They didnt have to run a play and they scored six points layup, layup, layup, Frank said. Its just disappointing. Thats what championship effort is all about. Everything they do is hard. Thats a great learning lesson for all of us. It was a far cry from the 119 points the Pistons scored in a win last month at The Palace. The Spurs didnt have Ginobili or Duncan that night, but Parker was brilliant and the Spurs missing all of their big three, plus Parker would win at Chicago just three nights later. We definitely are capable of doing better and weve shown it, Frank said. Weve got to be locked into one thing and thats got to be the team. Weve got to be team first and thats why San Antonio is a great model theyre agenda free. The efforts there on both ends. When you get your butt kicked like this, everyone across the boards got to be better. Its embarrassing.",Raw Data
575,"OKLAHOMA CITY There was a moment Sunday night in the Oklahoma City Thunder's 104-93 win over the Indiana Pacers that drilled right past the noise and clutter and hit at the very center of why this team has emerged as perhaps the best in the league. With 5:39 left in the first quarter of what would be a grinding but well-executed game for both teams, Russell Westbrook exploded from the right side toward the hoop. The speed of his attack, as always, was remarkable, but his layup rolled off the rim. As Pacers bodies swarmed for the rebound, Kendrick Perkins muscled his way into the play, pulled down one of his nine rebounds of the night and shot the ball to Kevin Durant, who was back behind the three-point line. Durant exploded, too, weaving between two bodies with unreal athleticism and putting up an acrobatic, spin-heavy layup of his own that slipped in. The play lasted six seconds, produced two points and delivered a single thought that, while perhaps a clich, was also rooted in a remarkable truth: Harden who? The fact is that a quarter of the way through this regular season and six weeks after trading James Harden to the Houston Rockets the Thunder have melded quickly into a team that so far is better without him. Don't believe it? Last season, the Thunder had the second-best offensive rating in the league with 109.8 points scored for every 100 possessions. Entering Sunday night's game against the Pacers, the Thunder were more than six points better: 113.6 points per 100 possessions. That's remarkable, and the reasons for what has been even by Thunder standards an incredible fast post-Harden learning curve can be found in moments like the one in which Westbrook, Perkins and Durant worked that three-man attack. Each has raised his game to compensate for Harden's absence, and to watch them play together with that kind of rhythm, talent and focus leaves little room to wonder about a former player, no matter how talented he happens to be. Serge Ibaka, as well, has raised his play in Harden's absence. This has been a team effort, doing the little and big things needed to let Harden's sudden departure fade into a past that no longer feels like the most important thing that's ever happened to this organization. To make up for The Beard's playmaking prowess, Westbrook has raised his assists per game from 5.5 last season to 8.7 so far this season. His turnovers are slightly down, and he had only two Sunday. Durant has done the same. His assists per game have jumped from 3.5 last season to 4.3 this season, and his turnovers are down, too. Ibaka has filled that hole with his own still-blossoming talent as well. He is scoring 14.4 points per game this season, up from 9.1 last season, and his usage rate is up substantially from last season. He had 12 points and nine rebounds Sunday, and his physicality was a force against a determined and well-coached Pacers team. That's a lot of numbers that spell out the fact that, somehow, this team under Scott Brooks has erased the need for Harden by piecing together a little more from just about everyone else. And then there's Kevin Martin. Martin, who along with Jeremy Lamb and draft picks arrived in the trade, has been excellent. He's subsumed his need to shoot he's a shooter, after all, and that instinct is part of his basketball DNA, so surely you can still see him physically override it every time he gets the ball. Instead, he's focused on being an efficient scorer, with the side benefit that when he does shoot he's often wide open. His field-goal percentage of 46.5 percent is his highest since the 2006-07 season. That's meant Martin has almost exactly filled the loss offensively that came with the Harden trade. Last season with the Thunder, Harden averaged 19.3 points per 36 minutes on 11.6 field-goal attempts. Martin has scored 18.9 points on 12.1 field goals per 36-minutes so far this season. Nor have the Thunder lost out defensively. They've allowed almost the exact same number of points per 100 possessions as they did last season, good for the 10th-best defensive rating in the league entering Sunday's game. That's been true despite the fact the team has yet to rebound as effectively as they should. Rebound better and more consistently and they could evolve into a top-5 defense. All of this was on display Sunday night. In the first half, Martin put on his James Harden suit and kept the Thunder in the game despite first-half shooting by Westbrook and Durant that was downright ugly: A combined 18 points on 5-of-19 shooting. So Martin, efficient and knowing his role, took over. He scored 22 of his 24 points in the first half on 6-of-7 shooting and by draining seven of his eight free throws. ""It's very valuable,"" Westbrook said afterward. ""K-Mart can score the ball with the best of them. Eric (Maynor) did a great job of running the team Nick (Collison), Hash (Thabeet), all of them did a great job."" That's the thing about this Thunder team. While the world was saying they'd given away the Western Conference by dealing The Beard, they went quickly and quietly about figuring out how to hold mastery over it. Right now, at 17-4, they look a lot like the best team in basketball. By the fourth quarter Sunday, Durant and Westbrook were ready to take over. The duo combined for 16 of the team's 20 fourth-quarter points, with Durant and Westbrook igniting a final five minutes of offense matched only by the team's defensive energy. That, too, used to be something The Beard would be asked to do. Instead Durant and Westbrook did the scoring and the Thunder worked together to hold the Pacers to two points and no baskets over the final five minutes, turning a 3-point game into a rout. This is the new-look Thunder: Westbrook and Durant learning to close out games, Martin lifting his team when those other two cant, Ibaka continuing to round into a star and the cast of role players general manager Sam Presti has built around them each understanding and executing their specific roles. So like I said: Harden who?",Raw Data
576,"Jen Floyd Engel, a Top 10 columnist for FoxSports.com in the 2012 Associated Press Sports Editors annual contest, had covered local sports for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram since 1997 and became a columnist in 2003 before joining Fox Sports. Sports opinions? She’s never short of them. And love her or hate her, she’ll be just another one of the boys. Follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook. 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman looked somewhat bemused as he started to watch a GIF of his coach, Jim Harbaugh, reacting to a failed fourth-quarter challenge on a reporter’s phone. Until we reached the high point. Then Bowman got geeked up. It was a huge moment, the outcome very much in doubt. But the reaction was overwrought even by Harbaughian standards, the dramatic bend forward to slap the ground, his fist balled as he let out a primal scream and finally the theatric turn to unleash a torrent of words so vile I cannot even begin to imagine. “That’s Harbaugh,” Bowman said excitedly. “He’s the head coach and, however the head coach is, that is the kind of team attitude-wise that you are going to have. That is definitely the coach we want to have."" That was the coach they had to have Sunday, trailing by 17 points in the NFC Championship Game and looking awful doing so. This kind of moment requires a big set of lower guts, a lack of panic, an ability to harness fear and turn it into intensity and a group of players who have absorbed this attitude by being preached it daily. This describes Harbaugh perfectly, and he is the biggest reason San Francisco came from behind and beat Atlanta, 28-24, to advance to the Super Bowl. And as an emotional San Francisco CEO and President Jed York talked about how the 49ers are all about family, I realized Harbaugh is the crazy intense uncle who you never quite appreciate until you need that ranting, raving guy on your side in a moment of crisis. “He might not put the media first. He might not put the rest of the league first,” York said. “I understand that is who he is. And I respect it. He is who he is.” “No, no, no,” York said. “It doesn’t matter what it is. He competes at everything, what water bottles are in the locker room. He’s competitive at everything. He has to win everything.” This type of personality is intensely difficult to deal with and wickedly dangerous to coach against, especially in a league where increasingly too many coach not to lose, coach not to be fired, coach what is safe, coach what is easily defensible. Broncos coach John Fox immediately comes to mind. I think of taking a knee with Peyton Manning and 30 seconds left against Baltimore. And then I think of Harbaugh deciding to go with rookie quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Both decisions had a risky option and a safe one. Fox went safe. Harbaugh went risky. The genius of Harbaugh was not simply that his gamble paid off. It is in his willingness to go all in, to be wrong. I said this after San Francisco beat Green Bay and it bears repeating: One of the greatest skills a coach, and really a human, can have is the willingness to really step into the arena, to dare greatly, to be willing to fail. And this, for better or for worse, is Harbaugh. From his risky decision to go with rookie quarterback Colin Kaepernick as his starter in Week 11, to unleashing a totally different game plan than what we saw work so well a week ago against Green Bay, to not abandoning the run after getting down 17-0, Harbaugh coaches very much like a guy who’d rather die on his feet than live on his knees. “The 49ers have no fear and it comes from the top to the bottom,” 49ers running back LaMichael James said. “That’s the way it is. That’s the way we play. That is what he teaches. And that’s how we feel."" I say all this not to take away from the San Francisco players. Harbaugh could have all the lower guts in the world and it would not matter if the 49ers lacked talent. They have talent. They also have swagger. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. Kaepernick, while not as spectacular as against Green Bay, played extremely smart, mistake-free football. James and Frank Gore blew through an Atlanta defense at a loss for how to stop them. And this 49ers defense, so thoroughly dismantled in the first quarter, pulled up their big-boy pants at halftime and started making plays right until the very end when Bowman broke up the Falcons’ fourth-down pass in the shadow of the end zone in the final minute. And then there was tight end Vernon Davis, mostly forgotten lately. He had been Alex Smith’s guy and his touches had not been there in the Kaepernick era. It was not that they were not targeting him, he said. The plays were just not there but he was all in with Harbaugh and he believed. “Harbaugh is the guy that we’ll play for, we’ll ride or die with him just because of that energy he brings,” Davis said. “It has an effect on the team because, if you look at this team, we are a high energy team. That is just what it is.” Afterward, in his typically droll remarks, Harbaugh did say something I thought was interesting. He thanked “the players and the coaches on their resolve, on their fight,” which struck me as strange because that is the one thing that would unleash GIF Harbaugh on his players if he believed his team had stopped fighting. The guy does not know how to quit. And Sunday that trickled down into a Super Bowl berth.",Raw Data
577,"When Li Na saw all the Chinese flags and heard the cheers of ''Jia You,'' or ''Let's Go'' in Mandarin, during her Australian Open final against Victoria Azarenka, she thought she might have been in Beijing. ''I can hear a lot of Chinese fans, yeah,'' she said after losing to Azarenka in three sets Saturday night. ''I was, oh, looks like China Open.'' Li was joking, but Australian Open organizers would be pleased to hear the comparison. The tournament has long billed itself as the ''Grand Slam of Asia-Pacific,'' and in recent years, it has stepped up its efforts to court increasingly affluent and tennis-mad fans in China. With Li making the women's final for the second time in three years, this has been easy to do. Attracting TV viewers was the first priority. When Li, China's top player, reached her first Grand Slam final at Melbourne Park in 2011, losing to Kim Clijsters, the tournament drew 120 million viewers in China. Seeing numbers like these, Tennis Australia signed a three-year deal with China Central Television and the Shanghai Media Group to broadcast the tournament throughout China, with a guaranteed minimum number of hours of coverage. The deal was in place in time for last year's tournament, which attracted 115 million viewers - without Li or any other Chinese player doing well. ''It'll be very interesting to see what this year's number is,'' said Steve Ayles, Tennis Australia's commercial director. ''We're certainly awaiting that with some anticipation.'' The tournament has also tried to build up its brand in China by taking the Australian Open trophy on a tour of the country, creating a Mandarin version of the Australian Open website and setting up an Australian Open account on China's version of Twitter, Sina weibo. Organizers also set up a tournament for aspiring players from the Asia-Pacific region to compete for a wild card into the main draw. The first edition of the playoff was held in China in October, and the wild cards went to two players from China - Zhang Yuxuan, who competed in the women's tournament, and Wu Di, who became the first man from mainland China to play in the main draw. More tour operators in China are offering package tours to Melbourne, as well. Ayles said these tennis-themed trips increased by 82 percent this year. ''What it means is when a Chinese player plays particularly well, because we have this all in place, it just heightens level of awareness of the Australian Open,'' Ayles said. ''Right across the board, when we have a player like Li Na play well and get to a final, obviously it helps underpin our strategy in China.'' Part of the reason for an outreach program like this is sheer protectionism. Several years ago, Tennis Australia feared it could lose its Grand Slam to a booming Asian city like Shanghai, eager to increase its profile on the global stage. ''Obviously if your business model is underpinned on 22 million people, it's quite a challenge for you,'' Ayles said, referring to the population of Australia. ''There's no question being part of a bigger region, that's where the opportunities for growth comes,'' he added. ''This is not 2-to-5-year strategy; it's 20-, 40-year strategy.''",Raw Data
578,"HOUSTON – Already on the same team since they drafted him with the No. 16 pick in the draft, the Rockets and Royce White might finally be on the same page. White and the club released a joint statement Saturday that says they have “an agreement that addresses the major issues,” that White is no longer suspended and will be immediately reinstated to the roster. The rookie forward has agreed to report to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League on Feb. 11, after first working on conditioning in Houston. The Vipers have a home game against the Maine Red Claws on Feb. 12. Rockets general manager Daryl Morey and White did not comment on the agreement. The settlement was approved by the NBA office and the players’ union. After months of acrimony, which included White taking to Twitter to accuse the Rockets of “inconsistent support” for his generalized anxiety disorder, the settlement at long last gets a player the Rockets had rated as among the top five talents in the 2012 draft. Despite his individual skills, White’s stock had dropped in the draft due to his mental condition as few clubs were willing to even consider the special circumstances that would be needed to deal with the player’s issues, which include anxiety over airline travel. White surprised the Rockets by not reporting to training camp and then, after what appeared to be a truce, left them again in early November, accusing them of not agreeing to a special set of “protocols.” White had resumed individual workouts with a member of the Rockets staff while the team was on the road during Christmas week, but was suspended on Jan. 6, a week after refusing an assignment to the Vipers. Morey then said they were suspending White “for refusing to provide services as required by his Uniform Player Contract.” Now, three months into the season, the battles might finally be just about basketball.",Raw Data
579,"﻿Ever since Cristiano Ronaldo admitted to being unhappy at Real in September last year, speculation has surrounded the future of the Portuguese star. His form may have been nothing short of miraculous but his Madrid-based ambitions remain plagued with vacillations. The European Champions League glamor tie with his former club Manchester United has seen this area of unease brought into focus following a spurious report in El Pais that Real would sell Ronaldo if he didn’t commit to a new contract and after former teammate Nemanja Vidic told reporters he wouldn’t be ""surprised"" by a CR7 return to Old Trafford. Whether driven by unhappiness in Spain, his love for the English Premier League, or due to stalling contract negotiations at the Santiago Bernabeu, according to some, it seems it is only a matter of time before the 28-year-old goes back to Old Trafford. So what can we make of this speculation, and should CR7 move back to the club which made him a superstar? Let’s talk about the speculation first. I know for a fact Ronaldo is regularly in touch with Alex Ferguson. He told me so when we met up last November in Madrid. I also know that his agent, Jorge Mendes, has a good relationship with Fergie and believes a return back to Old Trafford would improve his client’s brand and commercial revenue. Mourinho: Whole world will stop to watch The truth is Mendes and Ronaldo have become tired of all the infighting at Real Madrid and both of them believe all the negative energy around the club has affected the player’s image. A return to United would allow Ronaldo to have more emotional support and also increase his chances of winning some of the individual awards he craves. After all, the Premier League is the highest profile domestic league on the planet.",Raw Data
580,"No one will forget the toll championship expectations extracted from LeBron James, the most physically gifted and skilled player the league has known and the player with the highest basketball IQ playing today. Championship expectations are the NBA's litmus test for greatness. They're the trial by fire that burned me, Julius (Dr. J) Erving, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Dirk Nowitzki and countless others before melding us into champions. It's difficult to appreciate the burden, the weight and the mental fatigue of NBA championship expectations. Counting the playoffs, it's a 100-game death march carried out almost exclusively by players labeled ""superstars"" by the media, players whose careers will eventually be defined by what they accomplish in June. A close victory against the wrong team in January can be viewed as a lack of preparedness for June. A one-or two-game losing streak in March can create doubt that lingers until May. Your browser does not support iframes. Chris Paul is one of my favorite players. I've spent the past month wondering how he's dealing with the championship expectations no one saw coming. James knew what he was stepping into when he signed with Miami. Plus, he'd already dealt with championship expectations in Cleveland. Dr. J, Bird, Jordan, Shaq, Dirk and I all went into multiple seasons knowing our ultimate goal was hoisting the Larry O'Brien Trophy. Paul plays for the Clippers, an organization that wasn't considered a favorite until this year. He led them on a 17-game winning streak that stamped the Clips as championship favorites. There was no time to prepare. He has a chance to survive this, a chance to avoid the trial-by-fire championship-expectations burns that scorched the overwhelming majority of us the first time we confronted them. I'd say he has a chance. Here is why: Paul is one of the best point guards in the game today because he plays from the neck up and not the neck down. He is not the fastest player in the game nor is he the highest jumper. When you have mastered the study of movement and patterns -- termed offense and defense -- regardless of size or weight you can control the game. Every action causes a reaction. When the ball is in Paul's hands he controls the movement of the nine other players on the court. Only when the ball is in his hands does he have that power! I have watched Paul's journey through the NBA from his early years in New Orleans to present day with the Clippers. I remember when my childhood friend Darrell Walker, who is now an NBA assistant coach in New York and was formerly an assistant in New Orleans, called me and said these words: ""Chris Paul has it. I don't know what 'it' is, but he has it. He sees everything that is happening on the court."" There are certain phrases and words when spoken that I hear louder than others. ""He sees everything"" is one of those phrases. It is impossible to see everything on the court unless you have eyes in the back of your head. I have not seen nor played against this four-eyed monster. However,if you can acquire and apply the basketball science of defensive movement and offensive patterns, not only can you predict the outcome but you can control the outcome in your basketball laboratory -- the court. You can't control your teammates' shot making, but you can always lead them to a good shot. If you do a little homework and find out what your teammate's favorite spot to shoot from is, you can get him in a position to shoot from there every time. Paul this year has mastered his craft. I see a player thirsty for knowledge. In his quest to understand the power of the ""point,"" he has stumbled upon a championship journey. I don't believe at the start of the season there was a person playing in a Clippers uniform or a member of their management team that actually believed the Clippers could win it all this year. This is Paul's first championship journey in the NBA. His name, while always mentioned with the elite in the sport, had never entered into the championship discussion. His epiphany comes with newfound knowledge and a better understanding of player movement and defensive patterns. This allows him to think faster and process information more quickly. Now that he can control player movement and anticipate player reaction, he is two steps ahead of everyone on the floor. Because of his acquired knowledge, the game moves slower for him. This amped-up brain power allows him to play bigger, faster and appear to be more athletic than his actual physical gifts. Being two steps ahead mentally gives him space and time to imagine the outcome if one defender moves incorrectly. By the time you finish reading this sentence, Paul has read the defense and found Jamal Crawford for a corner 3 or Blake Griffin for another magnificent dunk. Paul has transformed the Staples Center from the home of ""Showtime"" to ""Lob City"". It's a joy to watch. It will be interesting to see if the burden of championship expectations steals that joy and replaces it with the pain most champions come to know intimately on their way to greatness.

581,"With next year's World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Olympic Games arriving in this seaside city, local officials are scrambling to solve a chronic hotel bed shortage so severe that during a UN conference here last year, the mayor had to appeal to residents to open their apartments to visitors. The plan? Slash property taxes for love hotels, known as ''motels'' in Portuguese, that agree to tone down the decor and free up 90 percent of their rooms for the tens of thousands of visitors expected to flood the city. ''Motels have all the know-how to be able to put people from around the world up in style,'' said Antonio Cerqueira, a vice president of the Rio chapter of the ABIH hotel owners association, Brazil's largest. ''What throws people is really just the decoration.'' With only 25,000 beds, or just half the estimated 50,000 needed for the Olympics, authorities here hope to add about another 6,000 beds through motel conversions, Cerqueira said. New hotels with another 14,500 beds are also in the works, he added. By comparison, the last Olympic city, London, has some 110,000 hotel beds. Brazil's love hotels are virtual temples of kitsch and a longtime staple in the world's largest Catholic country, where young people have tended to remain at home until marriage. Giant, coin-operated vibrating beds compete for prominence with bubbling baths built for two; mirrors proliferate, covering nearly every surface, and condoms and other sex-related paraphernalia share space in minibars with cans of beer and chocolate bars. A maze of towering walls or dense shrubbery shrouds the motels from prying eyes, with individual, covered parking spots that lead directly into rooms. Many offer remote check-in that doesn't require looking anyone in the eye. Theme rooms, sexed-up variations on medieval, swinging sixties, or tropical paradise motifs, abound. Teacher Paula Moura said motels were an institution in Rio's cultural landscape, and would be sorely missed if they disappeared. She said she used to go at least once a month with her boyfriend. ''We'd dress up, look for different ambiances,'' she said. ''Plus you don't have mirrors like that at home!'' Now that she's unattached, she likes them because they're a neutral space, she said. ''You don't bring someone you don't know well into your house, and you don't expose yourself by going over to their house,'' she said. Removing the sexy flair and giving the rooms a more neutral cast cost $15,000-$25,000 per unit, said Cerqueira, an investment that stands to be partially offset by a 40 percent reduction in city property taxes through 2019. Motel operators are still in talks with city officials over the finer points, but Cerqueira said he expects the deal to be inked by the end of the month. Love hotels in Brazil have been on the decline since the 1990s, with most struggling to reach 50 percent occupancy. Conventional Rio hotels regularly hit an 80 percent rate and completely sell out at peak times such as New Year's and Carnival, said Cerqueira. Plus, because love hotel rooms must be cleaned and sterilized after each occupancy, which generally doesn't last more than a handful of hours, they're more expensive to operate than conventional hotels. ''Mores have been getting more liberal, and young couples who a generation ago would have had no choice but go to a motel are now welcome to stay at home,'' Cerqueira said. Most motel clients are married couples visiting on a lark, business travelers looking to save money by renting by the hour and the sector's perennial staple: adulterers. Decorator Fabiola Brandao has been working her way through the Shalimar renovations room by room over the past four years, revamping 25 of the hotel's 61 rooms to date. ''We usually do two or three rooms at a time, and kind of try to block off the area where the work is being done,'' said Brandao. Still, no matter how discreetly workers attempt to work, the banging of jackhammers and pop of nail guns often prove impossible to muffle ''In those circumstances, we say to the client, `Can we upgrade you to a better room, with a better view?''' Brandao said. ''And then we send up a complementary bottle of champagne. It usually does the trick.'' The new rooms ''are the kind of place where you can stay for more than an hour without running away screaming,'' she said, adding that both the renovated and old-style rooms range in price from $34-$190 for a 12-hour rental, the preferred length of stay for business travelers. The Shalimar's management is planning to overhaul nearly all the units ahead of the Olympics, leaving but a few theme rooms, like the iron chain-strewn medieval suite. Motel operators hope the tourist gold rush brought by the World Cup and Olympics will last far after sports fans have left. Despite its world-famous Carnival, the city attracts around 3 million foreign visitors per year, only twice the number of tourists London typically receives in the month of August alone. ''We've seen it happen before that hosting the Olympics really puts a city on the map,'' Cerqueira said, citing the examples of 1992 host city Barcelona and Sydney, where the 2000 games were held. ''Rio de Janeiro has so much to offer, the beach, the spectacular cityscape, and with everything that's happening we can only expect for interest to grow. We'll be ready for it.''",Raw Data
582,"LOS ANGELES In the end, the Los Angeles Clippers did not have enough. Not without Chris Paul. Not against Kevin Durant. Not when the Oklahoma City Thunder strolled into town, buried 15 3-pointers, answered every Clippers' charge with a steely confidence and used a 109-97 win as yet another compelling case they are the best team in the NBA. This wasn't just a win. It was a statement. The Thunder, now 33-9 and at the halfway point of the season, are a better basketball team than anyone out there. Better than the Heat. Better than the Knicks and Spurs. Better even than the Clippers. With Paul out, Blake Griffin was magnificent. He had 31 points on 11-of-19 shooting, 11 rebounds, five assists, two steals and a block. His team responded, as well. They played a tough, gritty game; they fought and clawed despite missing their best player; and they held their turnovers to 10 with Eric Bledsoe running the offense. It was a gallant effort that ran smack into a Thunder team that, like its star, is playing on another level than most anyone else. It should certainly be noted that CP3's absence was an obvious and enormous factor. But equally obvious was the enormity of what the Thunder have become this season. They showed it with Kevin Durant's 32 points, seven assists and seven rebounds. They showed it with Russell Westbrook's 26 points. They showed it with a bench that in the first half delivered a surge of energy and efficiency form Nick Collison (eight points) and Kevin Martin (11 points) that kept the Thunder treading water long enough for Durant to come out in the second half and take over the game. ""They have the best record in the NBA for a reason,"" Griffin said. He's right. They do. The Thunder are armed with almost every conceivable weapon you could want before setting out to chase a title, and almost all of them were on display at the Staples Center. They have one of the two best players in basketball in Durant, a scoring prodigy who is in the midst of an offensive season that is historical in its greatness. They have a dynamic point guard in Westbrook. They have in Serge Ibaka, their third star and the person they bet on in a big way last season, a player who's responded by upping his game this season his scoring has jumped from 9.1 points per game to 14.0. The Thunder have the best offense in the league and a top-10 defense. Hardened by the bitter taste of losing in the Finals to the Heat last season the same lesson that in turn made Miami into the team that could win that series the Thunder have been remarkably efficient, they've managed to get better rather than worse after trading away blooming star James Harden and they finally play like they fear absolutely no one. It's true the Clippers, arguably the league's second-best team, were without their own star player Tuesday night. Paul sat out after more soreness from a bruised right kneecap that's hobbled him this month. But they're still a very good team that was playing at home, played with great energy and proved a sturdy test for Oklahoma City. Every time the Clippers came at the Thunder and tried to wrestle away control of the game, Oklahoma City answered. That's what the best teams do. They answer the challenges thrown before them. They dig deep. They win more of the moments that are turning points in games and seasons than anyone else. The Clippers gutted out a very good first quarter, ending the period with the score tied, and took the lead on the first possession of the second quarter. The Thunder promptly went on a 13-2 run. The Clippers cut a nine-point second-quarter lead to four at halftime. The Thunder responded by opening the second half with a 13-4 run. The Clippers made a late charge at the end of the game. The Thunder calmly put an end to that, too. ""We did a good job of just taking them out of their game,"" Westbrook said. ""They get involved and their crowd gets involved and it is tough to beat them out there."" Not as tough when you have the best offense in the NBA. The Thunder were scoring 112.9 points per 100 possessions entering the game. They came to Los Angeles with the seventh-best defensive rating in the league. They have the second-best field-goal defense, too. They score 7.6 more points per 100 possessions than the league average, a number that underscores how thoroughly Oklahoma City can dominate on both sides of the court. The Clippers experienced all of this. They were held to 46.4 percent field-goal shooting, they watched Oklahoma City shoot 52.6 percent from the floor (55.6 percent from beyond the arc), and with their own star sidelined they watched Durant weave his magic on their home turf. The Clippers are very, very good. But the Thunder armed with last year's Finals lessons, Durant and Westbrook's continued growth, and a sense of itself as a team that can only be found through time and hardship are something more. They're the best team in the league.",Raw Data
583,"Taking the plunge Tulane Stadium left mark on New Orleans Tulane Stadium was the site of three Super Bowls before the Superdome showed up. In fact, it paved the way for the Superdome to exist. (Focus On Sport/Getty Images) January 24, 2013 Focus on Sport/Getty Images The Superdome has been the site of seven Super Bowls and decades of Sugar Bowls, but both of those games were equally at home in Tulane Stadium. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images Tulane Stadium attracted an NFL team, the Saints, in 1967. Chris Graythen/Getty Images These days, LSU has the upper hand when it plays Tulane, but that hasn't always been the case. Focus On Sport/Getty Images) Halftimes were something at Tulane Stadium. This one just happened to take place during Super Bowl VI. Focus on Sport/Getty Images Memories like this one, from Super Bowl IV, will live on forever, even if Katrina washed away some of the evidence of them. NEW ORLEANS — It's quaint, narrow, this stretch of Willow Street, lined with colorful houses and dotted with puddles. A stray cat will scamper across if you wait long enough. The pavement buckles in spots, sinks in others, just as all roads in New Orleans are wont to do. There are too many of those stubborn, ancient live oak roots, with the ground more like swamp, after all, and so sometimes a line of cones and flags will say you simply cannot proceed. Not over that crack, you can't. And so you turn around and find another route. It's not like there's too much traffic on Willow Street, anyway. Audubon Boulevard is majestic. It's old New Orleans, the Old South, each house grander than the next, with columns and porticos and picture-book flowers. The neutral ground – or median, to New Orleans neophytes – is green and lush, and if you close your eyes and there's a break in the traffic, it could as easily be 1940 as 2013. The two roads meet, inconspicuously these days, on the edge of Tulane University's campus. It's another intersection, nothing noteworthy, just a line of fence behind the houses on the east side of Audubon. The fences are old. No one's sure how old, not really. The wood is battered and mossy, but in New Orleans, that means little; new wood looks that way after a summer. Still, they must have been replaced, people say, since then. But maybe not. It's only been 33 years. Maybe not. Thirty-three years ago, Tulane students could walk by the pile of rubble just beyond that intersection and pick up shards. Plenty snatched bricks and such, took them home over break to New Jersey and California, to Baton Rouge and Mobile and who knows where else. By 1980, the steel had been sold and the bricks were being hauled away, and that was all that was left of Tulane Stadium, the building at the northeast crook of Audubon and Willow, the behemoth that had once been the largest stadium in the South. ****** As fans flock to New Orleans for Super Bowl XLVII, the city's first since Katrina in 2005, they'll slurp hurricanes at Pat O'Brien's and queue up outside Galatoire's in hopes of snagging a table. They'll buy beads and mugs and nameplate key chains and tote them from sticky-floored bar to sticky-floored bar. On game day, throngs of 49ers and Ravens jerseys will push toward the Superdome, the home to seven Super Bowls, without a thought to the other three, the first three. Maybe they remember the Chiefs upsetting the Vikings in 1970, or the Cowboys beating the Dolphins two years later, or the Vikings again losing, this time to Pittsburgh, three years after that. It's unlikely, though, that they remember where all that happened. From the Superdome, hang a right, then a U-turn, head three miles uptown, and you're there. Or at least, you're where it was, but in its place you'll see a small field, a rec center, some students jogging. You'll wonder where on earth, how on earth, there was ever a stadium, much less a Super Bowl. Tulane Stadium opened in 1926 on the heels of the Green Wave's undefeated 1925 season, and over its 53-year life it was home to 49 Tulane and nine New Orleans Saints seasons, 41 Sugar Bowls and those three Super Bowls. The 35,000-seat concrete structure rose up at the edge of Tulane's campus, growing over the years to a capacity of 80,985. Its expansion was propelled by the 1934 birth of the Sugar Bowl, the New Year's Day game named for the old Foucher plantation, where sugar was first refined and upon which the stadium squarely sat. With the bowl game growing in prominence each year, the stadium grew along with it, to the point that it was the biggest stadium in the South and smaller only than the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Coliseum and Michigan Stadium. The Sugar Bowl pushed Tulane and New Orleans to prominence with the teams it brought in each Jan. 1, and from it the stadium took its alternate moniker, Sugar Bowl Stadium. The building saw its share of spectacle over the years, from the inaugural Sugar Bowl in 1935, a 20-14 Tulane victory over Temple, to the Tulane-LSU rivalry. From early NFL exhibition games to the Saints' opening day, a 27-13 loss to the Rams in which rookie John Gilliam ran the opening kickoff back 94 yards for a touchdown. And here's the thing: Without Tulane Stadium, there would have been no John Gilliam, at least not with the Saints, no kick return that old men are still jawing about today. There would have been no team, not without the preexisting stadium in which to install it, and college football might have died out in the city years before. There'd have been none of the unique culture that the Saints bred, and the passion the city heaps upon its beloved teams would have been directed elsewhere. (In fact, when the Superdome became reality, it talked first to Tulane about becoming tenants, rather than to the Saints. It was a symbolic gesture, of course, an acknowledgment that Tulane made professional football possible in New Orleans by providing its stadium.) Knowing what we know now, seeing the fierce love and joie de vivre of New Orleans sports, it would have been a damn shame. Longtime New Orleans Times-Picayune sportswriter and Sugar Bowl historian Marty Mulé puts it like this: ""If it weren't for the stadium, we'd all be out watching volleyball matches."" Instead, and fortunately, New Orleans got the Saints; the team was officially created on Nov. 1, 1966 and began play in 1967. It had been a long audition for the city; Tulane Stadium had hosted exhibition games (with record crowds to boot) throughout the 1960s, and its presence was a deal too sweet to pass up for the NFL. There was little more than the idea of the Superdome when the Saints arrived, only a stadium commission in place, and it was Louisiana, after all, where nothing political is ever easy, so the NFL knew it would be years before a new home existed. ""The Saints came with just the gleam, and the promise, and the talk of all that,"" said Darryl Berger, a New Orleans developer who's lived 61 of his 65 years within four blocks of the old stadium. ""But it was years."" ****** In the spring of 1970, Steve Barrios was a sophomore receiver at Tulane. He and his teammates were going through reps at the stadium when a well-dressed man stopped by their workout. He approached the team and asked the players a question none expected: Would y'all like to play in a domed stadium someday? Wouldn't that be fun? ""I remember that like it happened yesterday,"" Barrios said. ""It was like, who is this crackpot, you know?"" The crackpot in question was Dave Dixon, the father of the Superdome and the man most responsible for bringing the Saints to New Orleans. He'd spent years wrestling with government to get antitrust legislation passed, which ultimately landed him the Saints and paved the way for the NFL-AFL merger. But even knowing that, figuring out who Dixon was and the lengths to which he would go for the Saints, Barrios still thought the man was nuts. This was his stadium, his and his teammates', and by that point it was the Saints' too. Tulane was accustomed to practicing after NFL games on Sundays, sharing the field with pros. Barrios and his teammates had just months before snuck into Super Bowl IV through the Tulane coaches' offices, entering through an unmanned tunnel and scattering to find seats throughout. They didn't see anything wrong with their home. It was theirs, and in New Orleans there's a sense of history and ownership like no other, a sense of place and pride. How else does a city built in such a fragile fishbowl of a place rebuild after a devastating hurricane, with pride and tenacity to spare? In a way, Tulane Stadium shared that same improbability as New Orleans, that same sense of being squeezed into a space it shouldn't have been squeezed. Instead of Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi, there was Audubon Blvd. and Claiborne St. for the stadium, houses and schools and narrow streets upon which the whole thing seemed poised to overflow. Back then, the tight confines and lack of parking mattered less if you knew the right people, and really, of course you knew the right people if you were going to the game. Berger parked cars in his parents' driveway, charging commensurate with the caliber of the game. Everyone had their favorite spot, their friend who had a corner of his lawn reserved and a Bloody Mary waiting. Tailgates were cocktail parties, and afterward there was hardly the crush out of Uptown you'd expect; everyone went back to finish off those drinks and pour a few more. ""It was literally this huge stadium just right in the middle of the neighborhood,"" Berger said. ""Yet that was part of the charm and part of the event. … Gosh, the closer you lived to the stadium, the more privileged you felt. All the friends would come to your house. Your uncle so-and-so and your daddy's best buddy so-and-so would get together and park in your driveway."" Elliott Laudemann attended Tulane, and his uncle, F.D. ""Hap"" Reilly, was one of the inaugural Sugar Bowl members. Laudemann frequented games at the stadium from its early days to its last, from Tulane tilts to NFL exhibitions. He went to parties at his uncle's before and walked over, navigating through the Uptown streets until they gave way to what the Times-Picayune called in 1975 ""sports Camelot."" ""It was (crowded),"" Laudemann said. ""But it worked. It worked because it had to."" The same could be said for New Orleans, and where the Superdome is looming, shining, metal glory, Tulane Stadium was a product of its place. The Superdome provided a home to refugees for days, damaged but still mostly dry, the beacon of an underwater city. Tulane Stadium was never that and never could have been. It was squeezed and smushed and sardined into a neighborhood, and it took on the flavor of that neighborhood, of New Orleans, creating a tight-knit football society that still exists to this day. ****** In 1981, nearly two years after Tulane Stadium was torn down, a cherry tree split in two near Tiger Stadium on LSU's campus. According to Mulé, it was the result of some Tulane students who'd snuck up to Baton Rouge, a lock that was apparently too easy to pick and one giant, freed tiger by the name of Mike. He was Mike IV, more specifically, the live jungle cat that lived on LSU's campus and for many years and traveled with the football team to road games. In the wee hours of Nov. 28, the Tulane students had let him out of his cage and then run, leaving the police to eventually tranquilize him and get him back behind bars, but not before he hopped up into that cherry tree and shattered the thing. In 1981, the Green Wave and Tigers had achieved some parity, rare in the years after Tulane left the SEC in 1966, and that night, LSU lost at the Superdome, 48-7. It was Tulane's second win in three years in the rivalry and just eight years since it broke its 25-year drought against LSU in a 14-0 rout at Tulane Stadium. That game set college football attendance records for a night game and for any game played in the South, drawing 86,598 fans, and when it was all but over, the Tulane faithful are said to have urinated onto retreating LSU fans off of the upper deck. No one thought much of it. That's just how the rivalry went, and even tampering with Mike wasn't a first. In 1950, before a 14-14 tie, Tulane students stole Mike I while his cage was left unmanned outside Ye Old College Inn, a popular restaurant around the corner from Tulane that exists to this day. His handlers had gone in for a bite, and the students capitalized on the moment, hiding Mike under the stadium and painting his cage green before eventually returning him. To this day, no one will concede to having been the perpetrator, short of vague murmurs and knowing glances. ""I know a couple of people to this day who will not admit it,"" Mule said, ""but they'll kind of wink at you."" New Orleans is best characterized by a mix of tradition, which that rivalry brought in spades, and utter nonsense. Some things just don't make sense, like the notion that stealing a tiger is a good idea or the conspicuous lack of road striping, while others have been ingrained in to the culture such that they must make sense. That's everything from Tulane hating LSU even now, when one has been terrible and the other a perennial SEC contender for years, to Mardi Gras krewes to the little plastic Jesus babies they wedge into king cakes. The stadium was the same way. It didn't teach the city its piquant tradition – that's been there since long before 1926 – but it built it, bit by bit and sometimes through stories you couldn't make up if you tried. Today, the biggest name among football bigwigs in New Orleans is Tom Benson, the owner of the Saints and the NBA's Hornets. Benson is also a donor to the new, 30,000-seat stadium that Tulane is about to erect just off the footprint of the old one. That seems strange, you'd think, because what does Benson care about a struggling team about to enter the turmoil of the Big East, but it's more complex than that. Look at the documents from the original Tulane Stadium, back when it broke ground, and you'll notice a familiar name: Benson. It's Herbert Benson this time, Tom's great uncle, who was the architect of the original stadium and a president of the Sugar Bowl in the 1930s. So yes, it makes sense, Benson's donation, because this thing, this notion of football in New Orleans and the community it builds, spans decades and generations. Darryl Berger's father was one of the many businessmen in the 1930s to purchase Sugar Bowl bonds. They were sold to increase the size of the stadium – Tulane wasn't about to front the cost – and by buying them, purchasers were guaranteed certain perks, like seats to the Sugar Bowl every year. The Bergers got 12 prime spots in Tulane Stadium, and when the show moved to the Superdome, their real estate was just as good. ""To this day, I still go to the Sugar Bowl every year, and … I call those my daddy's seats,"" Berger said. ""There are hundreds and hundreds, thousands of others, that have the same sort of deep connection. That's back to the roots of Tulane Stadium."" The same holds for some Saints tickets, though the history is shorter. Laudemann, who was in his 30s when the NFL came to New Orleans, purchased seats in the upper deck of Tulane Stadium. He and his friends, about 300 of them, he said, all got seats together, and they'd split into groups before and after for cocktails, dinner and more cocktails at someone's house nearby. Things changed, obviously, when the Superdome came into play, but Laudemann still has those tickets. He's had them since Day 1, and to suggest he might have gotten rid of them – well, to him that's borderline ridiculous. ****** The Saints now are a regional phenomenon. Fans come from Baton Rouge, from Houma, from Lake Charles, trucking across the state for those games. At the beginning, though, that wasn't the case; in 1967, the NFL in New Orleans was a whole different beast. Gilliam's kick return was fun, sure, but the Saints lost that game, and most of the ones after it. They didn't have a winning season in Tulane Stadium, not for 20 years after their inception, not until 1987. They were the lovable losers, Berger said, but boy, if the games weren't fun. No one puts it better than Marty Mulé: ""The game,"" he said, ""it was not just a football game. It was a happening."" Al Hirt, a famous trumpeter and minority owner of the Saints, would lead the whole place in song, and it wasn't uncommon to see an ostrich race or a woman paraded out on a camel at halftime. (The Times-Picayune described one such camel sighting as a ""zoological triumph."") Before the 1970 Super Bowl, a balloon containing the Vikings mascot went up, and then all too quickly down, crashing near the stands without actually injuring anyone. Then, at halftime, performers reenacted the Battle of New Orleans, and the whole thing went awry when a cannon misfired, blowing off one man's hand. That caused the horse carrying the fellow playing Andrew Jackson to bolt and, by proxy, the British to win, rewriting fake history. Then, to add insult to literal injury, the man with the bloody hand was almost run over by one of those very ostriches and the small chariot it pulled. ""I have to say that was far more entertaining than the game,"" Laudemann said of those early halftime shows. ""And for whatever reason, that kind of discontinued."" For every cherished football moment in the old stadium, there's a commensurate memory of the weird. It went beyond just those halftime shows, beyond even the Super Bowls, although the 1975 contest set an auspicious record for the most pockets picked at a sporting event, according to the Times-Picayune. (They estimated 4,500 total.) The weird goes all the way back to the origins of the stadium in the 1930s, when the newspaper housed homing pigeons in a specially constructed cage on the sideline and then used them to fly film of games back to the office to be developed. The pigeons were in large part owned by the New Orleans Racing Pigeon Club, and the paper saw fit to run three long feature articles on them in a decade. Then there was the underneath to contend with, where plaster casts of Mayan ruins were stored for decades. Tulane was a leader in excavations in Central America for a time, and when it ran out of space, the casts were simply shoved next to the football dummies. There were Tiffany windows, too, which were found with little damage and later installed on campus. Same goes for two ancient Egyptian mummies, Got Tothi Ankh and Nefer Atethu, who beginning in 1955 spent 23 years in a room under the bleachers. They're still in fine shape today, especially the female, Nefer Atethu, although she's been relocated to a specially outfitted room where the mummies' curator, John Verano, is all too happy to bring her out and poke gently at her ""crispy"" skin. It's surprising but almost not. The stories around the place have piled up over the years, from cannons to mummies to tarps frozen to fields – that happened in 1964 – such that they've almost ceased to shock. It's New Orleans, after all, and it was a different time, and now we know where to put mummies and to have Beyoncé sing at halftime, and we've put a roof over the thing, too. ****** After Tulane and the Saints moved to the Superdome in 1975, Tulane Stadium stayed open on a limited basis. In 1978, the Broncos practiced in it before the Superdome's first Super Bowl, and high schools played there until just weeks before demolition began at the end of 1979. When the decision was made that the place had to come down – the steel upper decks had already been condemned and were unusable – Tulane organized a sort of funeral for the place, charging $5 for admission. About 15,000 fans showed up for a colorful program that included a narrated slideshow of the building's history. At the end of the program, two Tulane greats were present: Lester Lautenschlaeger, the quarterback of the undefeated 1925 team who was an assistant coach in 1926, and Roch Hontas, the 1979 quarterback. Lautenschlaeger was 75 at the time, Hontas in his senior year of college. The two clinked wine glasses, generation to generation, and the thing was over, the eulogy finis, the stadium abandoned to be disassembled. You could do that back then, bring in the man who was there for Day 1 to smile and pose with the current golden boy. You can't do that anymore. That first game, Tulane-Auburn, was played nearly 87 years ago. People are dying and memories are fading, and when you walk across that small quad where the stadium used to be, you don't hear the rattling of steel that the place was famous for, not even faintly. You can no longer picture hundreds Cub Scouts clustered in one end zone, stomp, stomp, stomping, finished with their drink- and program-selling and there to make the place sound like it was jam-packed full, even if the draw was only 30,000. The fences may remain, but the memory is nearly gone. When Katrina hit, the Sugar Bowl offices flooded. The bowl's artifacts and historical documents were kept there, and Laudemann remembers going back in after the storm and seeing old photos waterlogged and ruined. After that, the members learned their lesson, putting it all in offsite storage, but to even think about what was lost and looted is staggering. When Darryl Berger was a kid in the 1950s, he'd wait by the Tulane tunnel after games. The players were cleared to give their chinstraps to the waiting throngs of children, and everyone's goal was to come back with one, no matter how dirty, how smelly, how much your mama wanted you to throw it away. Berger's collection sat on the shelf in his room for years until someone trashed it or put it in storage, and so many of those chinstraps, too, must have washed away in the floods. But this is more than just Katrina. This is time and age and an obsession with the modern. When Tulane's new home, Yulman Stadium, opens in 2014, it'll sit just northeast of where the old one was situated, but no matter its amenities, it'll never be as imposing or magnificent as its predecessor. The school saved the stone archway from old Tulane Stadium's façade, though, and it plans to install it over the entrance of the new one. It's a beautiful tribute to a long-gone era, and maybe, just maybe, the echoes of the old stadium will return, however faintly, in its shadow.",Raw Data
584,"Greg Couch has been a national columnist at AOL Fanhouse and The Sporting News and an award-winning columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was featured twice in “Best American Sports Writing” and was recognized this year by the US Tennis Writers Association for best column writing and match coverage. He covers tennis on his personal blog. It has been an important life lesson for Tim Tebow, spending a year at the bottom of the barrel, a year with Rex Ryan and the New York Jets. Ryan and Tebow were never going to be a good mix, like oil and walking-on-water. Tebow learned, finally, that sometimes you have to be selfish. It is the only way to survive in this world. Sorry if that’s not the best Christmas message. But Tebow had done everything Ryan had asked all year, bulking up, even playing special teams. He did it without complaint. And when Tebow’s time came, and Ryan finally realized that Mark Sanchez can’t play quarterback, he still didn’t get his turn. Ryan passed over him for some third-string guy. Tebow reportedly refused to play in the wildcat offense on Sunday. That doesn’t make his good guy bit a fraud. No, it just moves him from 1950s black and white to 2012 reality. From here, Tebow can leave the Jets and continue to be a good guy, but just do it in less of Disney-fied way. Look, it’s possible that Tebow just can’t play football. I don’t see it that way, but his last two NFL coaches have. That doesn’t excuse the way Ryan treated him. It’s pretty simple, really. For all the meaning people have found in Tebow — Bill Maher thought he represented the evils of the political right — all he has done is try to be a good person and play football. That’s it. Two things. But that is too much for football people to grasp. It is such an unusual combination that coaches, GMs and owners can’t accept it, don’t know what to do with it. In Denver, coach John Fox tried to ruin Tebow's career for it. And Ryan just might have succeeded. Turns out, Tebow was just too much class for the classless acts of Ryan and Jets offensive coordinator Tony Sparano. He was too much grace for the graceless franchise that is the New York Jets. They used Tebow in the most mean-spirited way. No wait, that isn’t true. In Denver, it was more mean-spirited. In New York, they never even gave the man one thought. It was only the image they wanted. So the Jets smiled nicely at him, told the man they wanted him, paid him well, gave him a helmet and then treated him terribly while trying to benefit from the only thing they wanted: the image. If Tebow had known that that’s all he was there for, he never would have wanted to go to the Jets. He wants to play football. People might not see it as class that Tebow wouldn’t play the wildcat this past Sunday. But Ryan has never once been there for him. His time in New York is up. There was no need to prolong this, not after what happened last week. In Denver, Fox inherited Tebow, and never wanted him. But with fans Tebowing all over the place, and demanding to see Tebow, Fox finally gave in. It was not because he thought Tebow could help the Broncos win. It was because Tebow had become a hindrance in the rebuilding, a distraction. Fox played Tebow only to prove something to fans who thought of him as Football Jesus. He wanted them to know that Tebow can’t play. So Fox called all the wrong plays, and short, precise passes for Tebow, things he is especially not good at. And when Tebow started winning, ultimately leading the Broncos to the playoffs, it was a nightmare for Fox and John Elway. The Tebowmania just kept growing. Elway dumped him anyway, and covered his tracks by signing Peyton Manning. And the Broncos are Super Bowl contenders now. The Jets saw too many things in Tebowmania. Not Tebow, just the mania. The Giants had won the Super Bowl, while the Jets had become the new Bronx Zoo. The Jets wanted to class up the place a little, and get some of the attention from the other side of town. That’s not to say he can play at the NFL level. He has been given one chance, and he won with it. He has proven to be a leader, without fitting the paradigm. But his coaches just don’t think he can do it. Elway might have proved his point with Manning, though it took one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time to make that point. But nothing would have been lost by going to Tebow this past Sunday, when third-string guy, Greg McElroy, didn’t look any better than Sanchez, and the Jets lost again. I think Ryan was afraid of the man, actually. What if Tebow had done it again, started winning despite the inability to throw a precise pass? It would have made Ryan look all the more inept for sticking with Sanchez the whole season. What a mess. Theoretically, someone from the Jets had scouted Tebow, thought he had what it took to play quarterback, right? Hah! That was never part of the equation. So Tebow moves on now, after one more week with the Jets. He’ll likely end up in Jacksonville, where he probably should have gone for this year. Here’s hoping Jacksonville sees him as a man and not a stunt or political statement. After his college greatness at Florida, though, you wonder what they’ll see him as, football player or incredible ticket-seller. Fans there will pressure coaches more than they did in Denver. At least Tebow knows what to watch for. He is learning.",Raw Data
585,"Whether it's the history of Allen Fieldhouse or the frenzy of Cameron Indoor, college basketball boasts many distinctive arenas. Did your team's home court make the list? From Michigan State’s perspective, there was simply too much Victor Oladipo and not enough Keith Appling. Oladipo showed why he’s one of the most complete players in college basketball — and should be seriously considered for Big Ten Player of the Year — by leading No. 7 Indiana to a 75-70 victory over No. 13 Michigan State on Sunday afternoon at Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Ind. Oladipo did a little bit of everything to move the Hoosiers into first place in the conference. He stuffed the stat sheet with 21 points, seven rebounds, six steals and three blocks in 30 minutes. Appling, the key player for the Spartans, finished with three points, no assists and four turnovers while playing only 19 minutes because of constant foul trouble. He ended up fouling out with 5:17 remaining. “Even that 19, half of it was with fouls,” Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said during his postgame radio show. “We got nothing out of Keith.” The Big Ten has a reputation for playing ugly, low-scoring games at times, but that wasn’t the case in this one. It was as entertaining as college basketball gets in January. Both teams pushed the ball with an up-tempo mentality throughout most of the game. They combined for 19 3-pointers (11 by MSU). Indiana shot 50.9 percent from the field. Nevertheless, it wasn’t at the expense of the tenacity that is typical of of teams coached by Izzo and Indiana’s Tom Crean, one of Izzo’s former assistants. Oladipo, a junior guard, is arguably the nation’s most improved player this season. Few players make a bigger impact on a game than he did on Sunday. “He brings a lot of energy,” teammate Christian Watford told reporters after the game. “He gets us open by the way he attacks the basket.” More important, Oladipo creates opportunities with his relentless defensive style. “I have to bring it every night on both ends of the floor so my team can win,” Oladipo said. Indiana (18-2, 6-1) threatened to pull away several times, but Michigan State (17-4, 6-2) competed hard in a hostile environment. With Appling on the bench, the Spartans needed more from players such as freshman guard Gary Harris, who delivered in his first appearance back in his home state. Harris, who was Mr. Basketball last season in Indiana before bolting for East Lansing, hit five 3-pointers and led Michigan State with 21 points. It was not a warm homecoming from Hoosiers fans for Harris, who took his share of verbal abuse. “To come here and get booed and ridiculed and all the things that happen when you’re a hometown boy and you leave . . . for him to play the game he did, I thought spoke volumes about the kind of kid he is and the toughness he has,” Izzo said. Michigan State also got a big lift from center Adreian Payne, who finished with 18 points and nine rebounds. Payne, who had made four 3-pointers in 91 career games going into Sunday, surprised the Hoosiers with three from long range. While the Spartans couldn’t overcome Appling’s rough day, the Hoosiers prevailed even though their leading scorer, Cody Zeller, wasn’t quite himself for most of the afternoon. Zeller scored only nine points on 2-for-7 shooting, but he did come through with a couple key plays at the end. First, his drive down the middle of the lane gave Indiana a 74-70 lead with 1:38 left. Zeller then took a charge against Payne with 14.3 seconds to go, putting an end to the Spartans’ comeback bid. Even on their worst days, standout players need to make timely contributions. Zeller did just that while Appling watched from the bench. “We didn’t have our key guy to make the plays,” Izzo said. “Usually we put it in Appling’s hand, and we (basically) didn’t have Appling the whole second half.” The Spartans also missed Appling defensively. Reserve guard Travis Trice often failed to stop penetration. Indiana now plays three of its next four games on the road, including Wednesday at Purdue. The only home game during that stretch is a nationally televised, primetime showdown Saturday against No. 2 Michigan. Michigan State, meanwhile, is at home for its next two — Thursday against Illinois and Feb. 6 against Minnesota. While disappointed that his team lost its grip on first place, Izzo liked what he saw, for the most part, under the circumstances. “I’ll take away a lot more good than I will bad,” he said. “Every time we went down, we battled back. That shows a lot of character in a team, especially in a place like this.”",Raw Data
586,"With the late afternoon shadows crossing centre court at the VTR Open in Chile, a dark haired 26 year old Spaniard grunted, ripped a forehand winner, and followed it up with a series of energetic fist pumps. VAMOS! Rafael Nadal had just taken the opening set in his comeback match against Argentine Federico Del Bonis 6-3. That moment reminded the sporting world exactly what they had been missing for 7 long months, the unique aura of an 11 time grand slam winner and one of the greatest athletes of his generation. Nadal’s re-emergence from a knee injury induced hiatus at the obscure tournament has been as straight-forward as many had expected. Barring a major upset, Nadal should beat his semi-final opponent Jeremy Chardy and go on to clinch the title. What’s more important is how sharp Nadal looks and the implications his comeback has on the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) landscape. Whilst Federico Del Bonis and Daniel Gimino-Traver, the two opponents Rafa has defeated so far in his comeback do not exactly strike fear into the hearts of opponents, the efficiency of Nadal’s performances was still noteworthy. He has shown less rust than expected, serving with confidence and moving his foes from side to side in the punishing manner for which he is renowned on clay. Arguably the greatest clay-court player of all time is still proving to be his dominant and intense self. Nevertheless, there have been a couple of minor hitches; at times the the 26 year hasn’t hit the ball with the usual depth, he also showed some nerves in the final game of his quarter-final match against Traver, leading to a rather erratic finish. As we move into the Spring and the opposition gets tougher, Nadal with more matchplay under his belt will do one of two things: struggle to adjust to facing top quality foes as he did in his previous comeback in 2009 or thrive and once again mount a charge to the top of the world rankings, having fallen to number 5. The two prestigious American hard-court events in March at Indian Wells and Miami will be pivotal in his comeback. Murray, Federer, Djokovic and Ferrer have been put on notice. The King of Clay is back. What happens now is anyone’s guess; another injury to Nadal’s troublesome knees cannot be ruled out but for now the Majorcan Matador is back and the flavour of the ATP 2013 season has just become even more tantalising.

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. John Dodson could nearly be classified as morbidly obese a few weeks back. The 5-foot-3 UFC flyweight contender — who faces champ Demetrious Johnson for the 125-pound division title at UFC on FOX 6 on Saturday — recently weighed 168, a couple tenths in the body mass index below the National Institutes of Health's cutoff for obesity. Dodson beefed up to help his teammates at Jackson Winkeljohn MMA train. Staying at 125 pounds, Dodson explains, wouldn't make him a very viable sparring partner as he pushed his colleagues around the Octagon. ""Even though I was bigger, I could still move alright,"" Dodson said. ""I dropped a few guys at the gym, something that made (trainer) Greg (Jackson) and others laugh."" Dodson admits remaining heavy — while maybe not more than 40 pounds than he is now — could be in his future. ""Everyone has more respect for the heavier weight (classes),"" Dodson said. ""They get on us because we're so little. The average height for a male is, what, 5-8? They say, 'Since we are not even average height, why do we care?'"" The UFC, however, thought enough of both Dodson and Johnson to put him atop of a card on broadcast television. ""I believe what UFC is giving ... myself and John Dodson is a chance to show what the flyweight division can do,"" said Johnson, UFC's first flyweight titleholder in a division introduced last year. ""It will educate the fans as well. This is the division to watch."" Added Dodson: ""It gives us a chance to showcase what we're all about. A lot of people are talking about how we aren't able to finish anybody, (but) it depends. If everybody is great in the division, it's hard to get finishes."" Johnson is favored Saturday, although Dodson has won each of his first three UFC fights and has a five-fight winning streak overall. ""I don't really care who anybody else is picking,"" Dodson said. ""I'm picking myself. That's the only thing I care about."" Dodson certainly has the backing of a couple fighters on the UFC on FOX card in teammates Donald Cerrone and Clay Guida. ""It's our camaraderie down at Jacksons,"" Cerrone said. "" Everybody is always having a good time and playing around. John is the best one to play around with. He's a little baby."" ""He keeps calling me a 'baby,'"" Dodson responded during the news conference. ""Do I really look that young? ... It's all my big brothers picking on me."" At 28, Dodson won't be growing any more — at least height-wise. Whether he makes the jump to bantamweight (135) or even to featherweight (145) will probably hinge on the outcome of Saturday's bout. Not that Dodson won't near that clinically obese level again for other reasons, like a sugar high. ""I was eating like seven or eight times a day,"" Dodson reminisced.

590,"The Chicago Blackhawks are off to the best start in their 85-year history, despite not being in charge for much of their game against the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday night. Enforcers' fists fly in this NHL season's best fight photos. Thanks to Nick Leddy's goal at 2:45 of overtime and a zoned-in, 29-save effort from Corey Crawford, the Blackhawks defeated the Red Wings 2-1 and improved to 6-0. After taking a cross-ice pass from Viktor Stalberg, Leddy fired from the left circle and beat Detroit's Jimmy Howard with a shot that slipped just under his glove. Leddy, a defenseman, said it was his first overtime goal at any level. ''It's an unbelievable feeling, one I'll never forget,'' he said. ''I heard that stat (best start) before the game. If we stick to doing the little things, we'll be great.'' The Blackhawks started 5-0 in 1971-72 - Hall of Famer Bobby Hull's final season in Chicago - and matched it on Saturday night with a 3-2 win in Columbus. On Sunday, however, they were anything but assertive for much of the second and third period. Part of that was penalty-related. Still, Chicago killed all six of Detroit's power plays, improving to 22 of 23 this season. Detroit's Johan Franzen finally connected at even-strength early in the third to tie the game at 1 and set up overtime. Duncan Keith scored a power-play goal in the first period for Chicago. ''We could have been on our heels a little bit,'' Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said. ''Detroit was pressing (being) down a goal. You know everything's coming. They were pinching. ''We could have been better, but at the same time, six (games) in nine (days) could have been a factor.'' Quenneville couldn't really fault his club, one of two undefeated NHL teams along with San Jose. ''I think everybody deserves credit,'' Quenneville said. ''Everybody's contributing. Everybody was where we wanted them to be. Everybody had good conditioning to start with. Special teams, Crow (Crawford) in net, the team game. I'm pleased.'' Crawford, who made his fifth start in six games, was sharp again. Last season, the Blackhawks' 28-year-old No. 1 goalie was criticized for allowing soft and untimely goals. That hasn't happened so far this season. ''Focus has been a huge part of it so far,'' Crawford said. ''I thought I was focused last year, but I wasn't quite there. ''This year, I've paid a little bit more attention to that, especially throughout the game. Every play around the net, I'm ready and getting low for little things around the net so I don't give up those little goals.'' Crawford needed to be sharp when his teammates sagged on Sunday. ''I thought we really carried the play in the last 30 minutes of the game,'' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said. ''They were better than us early. They outskated us, and then we really dug in and got playing a while. We had every opportunity to win the game.'' Injury-depleted Detroit has gone just 2 for 26 with the man advantage so far. ''We've got to shoot the puck a little more and maybe things will be a little different,'' Franzen said. ''It think it's just a matter of getting the shots and getting the traffic.'' Howard, who has started all five of Detroit's games, made 25 saves. Chicago has won four straight against Detroit, dating to Feb. 21, 2012. The Blackhawks and Red Wings met for the 722th time, the most of any two NHL opponents. Sunday's game was only the Blackhawks' second at home, and they begin a six-game road trip Wednesday in Minnesota. The Blackhawks don't skate at home again until Feb. 12 as they play 10 of their first 12 games away from the United Center. Keith scored the only goal of the first period, during a power play 2:24 in. Crawford had to be sharp to preserve the lead in second. Early in the period, he made close-in saves on Todd Bertuzzi and Henrik Zetterberg. And the Blackhawks needed Crawford as they ran into penalty trouble in the second. Detroit was unable to convert any of four straight power plays beginning midway through the second, including a 43-second 5-on-3 advantage. ''The D were blocking the shots,'' Quenneville said. ''Key saves by Crow (Crawford). It was a group effort, with spectacular kills. ''We dodged a bullet. It was the key to the game.'' The Blackhawks started the third sluggishly, and Franzen finally tied it at 1 with an even-strength goal at 4:30 of the period. After Zetterberg's shot was blocked, Franzen picked up the loose puck and closed in from the right circle. He got by Keith and beat Crawford with a shot between the legs. Crawford made a point-blank stop on Cory Emmerton midway through the third to preserve the tie. Howard then made sprawling saves on Brent Seabrook and Jonathan Toews during a Chicago power play with just under 5 minutes left in the third. Keith's shot a minute-and-a-half later hit the post. Crawford stopped Franzen's prime chance 1:30 into overtime. Notes: Red Wings D Jonathan Ericsson returned after missing three games with an injured hip. ... Detroit C Darren Helm (back) and D Jakub Kindl (healthy scratch) sat out after playing on Friday against Minnesota. Both have missed four of five games so far. ...

''We just knew we had to come out and play (better) defense. So that's what we did.'' Lucas said the main thrust of Washington's halftime talk was to stick together. ''We have a lot of trust for each other,'' she said. ''We kind of had to be reminded of that after the first half, that we've played together for a long time and we can rely on each other.'' Washington conceded that she was rather forceful in making her points in the locker room - ''in my own way,'' she said quietly. It was clear the Nittany Lions got the message. ''We played with a lot more energy and focus and trust the second half,'' she said. ''The first half I just felt like we didn't play together on either end of the floor. That was the most effective adjustment we made going into the second half was playing together more on both ends of the floor, communicating more, rotating quicker. We had a lot more energy the second half and that allowed us to execute the game plan.''

Tayler Hill, the Big Ten's leading scorer, had 28 points for Ohio State (11-9, 1-6), which had won the last six meetings at home against Penn State dating to Feb. 27, 2005. Ameryst Alston added 12 and Amber Stokes returned to the lineup and provided some energy after missing the last four games with a sprained knee. It was another disappointing day for the Buckeyes, who have been a perennial power in the conference and haven't lost more than six games in Big Ten play in any of coach Jim Foster's 10 previous seasons. ''It's attitudinal. You've got to be tougher,'' he said, referring as much to one lapse in the second half as to his team in general. ''You've got to want to work through it and you've got to fight.'' Hill scored on Ohio State's first possession of the second half to stretch the lead to 11. But then came the one possession that Foster was talking about. Penn State missed two field goal attempts, hit two of four free throws and got a 3-pointer from Lucas - all on one trip down the court, thanks to two offensive rebounds off missed free throws in the same sequence. When Bentley then stole the ball on the next play and hit the coast-to-coast layup, the Nittany Lions had made up seven points in 33 seconds with the ball barely leaving Penn State's end of the floor. With the Buckeyes hanging on to a 41-39 lead, the Nittany Lions then took the lead for good with a 9-0 run. Greene tied it before Lucas made it 43-41 on a jumper in the lane. After Ohio State missed four straight attempts from the field, Ariel Edwards raced to the hoop for a layup in transition and was fouled, completing the three-point play. Greene then closed the uprising the way she started it with a bucket inside, off an assist from Lucas, for a 48-41 advantage. Ohio State never got closer than five points again as the Nittany Lions slowly pulled away. Washington said that even when the Buckeyes were on the 12-0 run and led by 11, she tried to be calm and patient that her charges would work their way out of it. ''We try not to get rattled either way. We try not to get too giddy when we get off to great starts and we try not to get despondent when we don't get off to a great start,'' she said. ''We want to play for 40 minutes and play with a high level of focus and intelligence.''",Raw Data

593,"BEIRUT: Defending champions Champville tied the longest winning streak of the season, with their eighth consecutive victory coming after narrowly beating Mouttahed 98-94 Sunday in round 15 of the Lebanese Basketball League. Sagesse had previously won eight straight games at the beginning of the season, and Champville looked on course to tie that record from the outset. The defending champions came firing out of the blocks, leading 16-8 midway through the first quarter. The imposing trio – Fadi al-Khatib, Nikoloz Tskitishvili and Reyshawn Terry – again proved a force to be reckoned with, threatening from all angles of the court. Champville were on fire from behind the arc, making most of their shots to lead 30-23 in the first break. The hosts faced a little scare as head coach Ghassan Sarkis was forced to bench Khatib after the team captain committing his third foul. Mouttahed were up for the fight in the second, with Bassel Bawji relishing the contact on his way to the basket. And Mohammad Akkari got in on the act with eight straight points, including two triples, as the Tripoli side came within three points at halftime 47-44. The third was just as hard-fought, with Mouttahed leveling the score 50-50, as American forward Marc Salyers continued to lead the visitors’ attack. But Terry began to use his considerable size advantage to keep the home side up by four midway through the third. Nadim Souaid also starred for his side, delivering in decisive moments as Champville led 68-62. But Bawji produced again on his way to 21 points and seven rebounds. He and teammate Rony Fahed helped Mouttahed lead 71-70 going into the final quarter. But the potential game-changer came just moments later – with former Lebanon international Fahed drawn into committing his fifth foul of the game. The combo guard scored 12 points in 19 minutes. The game remained tightly poised with Salyers and Bawji contributing offensively, as the Tripoli side sniffed an unlikely victory, leading 82-81, five minutes from time. But Champville once again showed their experience down the stretch. Terry demonstrated his determination with a superb and timely one-handed dunk to light up the crowd and pick up the momentum for his side. He topped the charts with 30 points and six rebounds. Mouttahed had the chance to level the score with 12 seconds left, but Salyers’ effort was in vain as Champville showed great composure when converting their free throws to secure their eighth straight win. Alongside Terry, Khatib had 19 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, while Tskitishvili added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Karl Sarkis also contributed with 15 points including three 3-pointers. Bawji and Salyers were the joint top scorers for Mouttahed with 21. The result means Champville are now second, at least for 24 hours, with an 11-4 record, while Mouttahed remain in fourth place at 9-6. Elsewhere, League leaders Sagesse overcame a furious Byblos rally to grab an 82-76 win at Ghazir Stadium. The last times both teams met, Sagesse needed double overtime to overcome Byblos away from home 123-115. And another close contest seemed on the cards, with the home side leading 8-7 after four minutes. The result saw Sagesse improve their record to 13-2 in pole position. Meanwhile, Byblos lost for the second straight game to stay in sixth place with 8-6. Aaron Harper top scored for Sagesse with 25 points, nine rebounds and six assists, while Deshawn Sims added 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Elie Rustom added 11 points. Youngblood led the scoring for Byblos with 20 points, and Mike Fraser added 16 points and game-high 19 rebounds. In the weekend’s only other fixture, Bejjeh narrowly beat home side Anibal Zahle 83-81 to move away from the bottom spot. American Harold Jamison top scored for the Jbeil side turning in 26 points and eight rebounds, overshadowing Tarek Ammoury’s 20 for Anibal. Bejjeh remained in seventh place with 5-10, while Anibal stayed rooted to the bottom at 2-13.

594,"Even though her young, yet fifth-ranked Fighting Irish were beaten by the Lady Bears - just as they were in the national title game last season - McGraw thinks her squad offered more of a challenge this time. The game was tied with seven minutes to go when the Lady Bears (7-1) used a 10-0 run to pull away en route to a 73-61 victory Wednesday night over Notre Dame, which has only two starters back from last year's team. ""We were much better than we were last year, with a much younger team - and they have the same team. So I was pleased. I think we've gotten better,"" she said. ""I think when we watch the tape, we're going to see so many growing mistakes."" Brittney Griner had 24 points and 14 rebounds, three other Baylor players scored in double figures and the Lady Bears dominated inside. They outscored the Irish 36-26 in the paint and outrebounded them 44-35. The bright spot for the Irish was freshman Jewell Loyd scoring a season-high 24 points. Loyd said she felt comfortable playing in her first big game. ""I just came to the game thinking it was just another home game, and I got into a rhythm early,"" she said. McGraw knew the Irish were in trouble when Griner, who was 10 of 16 from the floor, started hitting a couple of shots from 15 feet. ""That's what we wanted her to take,"" she said. Griner said she let the game come to her. ""Last year, I guess I started getting even more patient. I couldn't get my hands on the ball, keep moving. Whatever I can do, I will do. I took it a play at a time, post up strong when I had to. Did whatever I could to help my team out."" The Irish were simply no match for the Bears, especially with All-America senior Skylar Diggins struggling on 4-of-19 shooting and scoring eight points. McGraw said the loss could give the Irish confidence. ""I think we maybe learned that we're better than we think we are,"" she said. Odyssey Sims returned after missing four games with a hamstring injury and added 16 points for Baylor. Coach Kim Mulkey said she thought Sims' play proved she's the best point guard in the country. ""She's played Skylar four times and won every ball game. She's won a national championship,"" Mulkey said. ""Odyssey didn't have one of her best games, either, but she never stopped being tough on the floor, and she never stopped guarding people."" McGraw said Sims makes Baylor tougher to play. ""When she's not in the game, you don't really have to guard them very much from the perimeter. So just having her on the court stretches the defense to her side a little bit more,"" she said. Brooklyn Pope added 14 points for Baylor, and Jordan Madden had 12. Diggins was frustrated by her bad shooting. ""I don't think I hesitated on my shot. It just wasn't going in,"" she said. Kayla McBride had 18 points for Notre Dame and Natalie Achonwa 11. No one else scored for the Irish. Mulkey said she was impressed by Loyd. ""She's a tremendous jump shooter. Not many can take it off the dribble and shoot a jump shot. She's a special talent,"" she said. Rapper Lil Wayne showed up at halftime, with Diggins walking over to shake his hand at his front-row seat after a timeout. In the front row at the other end were members of the top-ranked Fighting Irish football team, who cheered loudly throughout. Despite the celebrities and a sellout crowd of 9,149, the Irish couldn't knock off the defending national champions as the men did six days earlier against Kentucky on the same floor. Diggins said she was happy to see Lil Wayne at the game. ""I think it's great for our sport. Anything that can draw attention to women's basketball is great,"" she said.

596,"– Greg Monroe became the first Piston since Grant Hill 17 years ago to post eight straight double-doubles and he took the suspense out of it early by racking up 11 points and eight rebounds in the first quarter alone, finishing with 16 points and 18 rebounds. But the Pistons kept the suspense going a lot longer than that before pulling away in a 96-85 win. They used two 11-0 runs in the fourth quarter, the first to give them a six-point lead and the second to break a 76-all tie. It was a big night for their point guards: Jose Calderon knocked down 6 of 9 3-point shots on his way to 24 points, while Will Bynum, who scored the first six points of the second 11-0 run, came off the bench to score 20 in 21 minutes. BLUE COLLAR – With Andre Drummond out with a back injury, Slava Kravtsov is sometimes in the rotation and sometimes not – it usually depends on the makeup of the oppostion’s bench. Kravtsov came on early in the fourth quarter to give Greg Monroe what was supposed to be a brief rest. But the Pistons played such staunch defense after Kravtsov entered – stopping Washington on nine straight possessions – that Lawrence Frank rode him for six full minutes. Kravtsov finished a lob dunk from Will Bynum during that stretch and grabbed a key offensive rebound that led to two points. He also had a blocked shot and two steals. RED FLAG – In every game plan, you concede something. It makes sense that the Pistons would have invited their last two opponents to go to non-scoring big men Robin Lopez and Emeka Okafor, but they got burned in both cases with Lopez scored 23 points in Monday’s loss to New Orleans and Washington’s Okafor went for 20 points – all of them in the first three quarters – which was more than double his per-game average. When the Pistons shackled Okafor in the fourth quarter, they outscored Washington 31-17. If the old bromide about center and point guard being a basketball team’s two most critical positions remains valid, then the Pistons were destined to win Wednesday’s All-Star getaway game. Point guards Jose Calderon and Will Bynum combined for 44 points, Calderon draining 6 of 9 long-distance shots on his way to a game-high 24 points and Bynum racking up 20 points and eight assists in just 21 minutes off the bench. Greg Monroe, meanwhile, had joined Grant Hill as the only Pistons over the last 17 years with eight straight double-doubles – and Monroe did it by halftime, finishing with 16 points and 18 rebounds. But if the contributions of Slava Kravtsov don’t jump off the box score with nearly the force of those three, they were perhaps no less critical to the win. The little-used Ukrainian rookie anchored Detroit’s defense during an 11-0 run early in the fourth quarter when the Pistons came from five points down and stoned Washington on nine straight possessions. Kravtsov finished with four points on two dunks, blocked a shot, recorded two steals and came up with an important offensive rebound that led to two points in 14 rock-solid minutes. “Slava’s great,” said Bynum, who rewarded Kravtsov’s defensive showing with a lob that capped the 11-0 run to put the Pistons ahead 76-70 with 6:29 to play. “He’s big out there. He’s a force in the paint. Whenever he’s playing defense like that, you want to get him something easy and that’s what I was trying to do out there.” “I thought he was instrumental,” Lawrence Frank said of Kravtsov, whose spot in the rotation since Andre Drummond went down with his back injury is usually matchup dependent. “We held them to two points (in the first 5:54 of the fourth quarter, which came on two Trevor Ariza free throws on Washington’s first possession of the quarter). His paint protection, he was great. He played good post defense. I don’t know if he had a rebound, but just his length, his energy, his screens for Will, getting Will open … I just really liked the defensive energy of that group.” After Washington broke through with its own 6-0 run to tie the game at 76, Frank went back to Monroe and Calderon, pairing the latter with Bynum. Bynum ran off the next six straight points, then found Calderon for an open corner three and the Pistons were off and running toward their second 11-0 run of the quarter, this one a clincher. Calderon had put up 39 assists against just seven turnovers in his first five games, but the Wizards turned him into a shooter. For three quarters, the Pistons struggled to shoot 40 percent and Calderon was one of the few making shots, which partly explained why he wound up with only three assists. He played off the ball in the final six minutes of the fourth quarter with Bynum directing the offense. “It’s chemistry,” Bynum said of learning to play with Calderon. “It’s learning each other. It’s the first couple of games together. I’m sure as we continue to play together, we’re going to play better and better. I’m loving it and I look forward to continue playing with him. “It’s kind of what the league is doing right now. It’s great. It’s a matchup problem for other teams. I’m never concerned about competition or nothing like that. I invite that. It’s been here since I’ve been here. I never complain. I’m going to get after it every day. I’m going to make him better every single day. It’s all about the team. It’s all about us getting wins and that’s what I’m all about.” In their 31-point fourth quarter, Bynum scored 12 points and Charlie Villanueva added seven to go with two rebounds and a blocked shot. Villanueva also hit a huge 3-point shot that resulted in a four-point play to put the Pistons ahead 71-70 on a night they played from behind for the entire second half until that point. “It was huge,” said Kyle Singler, solid again with 12 points and seven boards while keeping the resurgent Martell Webster under wraps, of that momentum changer. “Big shot. But what was great was we got big plays from everyone tonight. Everyone stepped up, played well and it was a good team win.” And it came against a Washington team that had been on a tear since John Wall returned from a knee injury that kept him out of the lineup for the first 33 games. The Wizards, 5-28 when Wall returned, were 10-7 with him and on a four-game win streak before Wednesday’s loss, and they’d been the NBA’s top defensive team over that time. “They were on a roll,” Singler said. “We knew they were going to come in and play us well. It was a good win for us, especially coming off the loss against New Orleans. It was important for us to play well going into the break.” The Pistons are off until Tuesday, when they host Memphis – with Tayshaun Prince in the starting lineup and Austin Daye coming off the bench. The team that put up 31 points on Washington in the fourth quarter – with Jose Calderon dropping 3-point bombs and Slava Kravtsov anchoring the paint on defense – is one Prince would barely recognize.

597,"(On the loss tonight): “We out ourselves into that position. We played 3 quarters, but our ability to get stops in the 4th quarter was not there. We just struggled offensively. You know on the road you are not going to have things going your way. That was a playoff team out there against us, and they played that way.” (On Noah's save): “It looked like the ball went out of bounds. Belinelli just made a great shot. That's like his 2nd game winner in a week. Regardless, we put ourselves in that position. We just need to do more earlier. Also Nate Robinson was huge for them.” (On what happened in the 4th quarter): “We had some decision making errors out there. We were passing up open shots, and allowed mistakes to let them back in the game. We allowed our poor offense to effect our defense. It is very disappointing. When you're not scoring you have to be disciplined on defense and get stops. It is harder to score in the 4th quarter. Nate Robinson opened up that game for them and that is sometimes what happens. One guy opens it up for the rest of his team. We just had too many stretches on both ends where we needed to be better disciplined.” Pistons Forward Tayshaun Prince (On loosing the 7 point lead): “Lay-ups. We just did contest them. They got in the paint and back in the game that way. We let them start in the 3rd quarter but we responded then and didn't let them get back in it. We didn't match that energy in the 4th quarter and it cost us.” (On their early 4th quarter offense): “Early in the 4th quarter we just rushed a couple shots. Then,we let Nate get out and play. We just got off to too slow of a start offensively. Thibodeau does a good job trusting his 2nd unit. He leaves them out there and lets them play. We have to match their energy for 4 quarters. We did it for only 3 ½ tonight and you see what happens. The last 2 or 3 times we have played them we had leads through 3 quarters. We should have had wins. We talked about that before tonight's game. You need to match the energy that Joakin and Taj give them or they are going to come back on you. Tonight Taj, Jimmy, and Nate did that. Their energy was there and they played off that to a win.” Bulls Head Coach Tom Thibodeau (Do you want to talk about the strong 4th quarter or the poor play in the 1st 3?): “I think you have to look at the game in totality. We did not play our best and we found a way to win in the end. That is the type of stuff you have to do. We showed some perseverance. Detroit played really hard and they had a lot to do with our play. In the end, we had a lot of guys step up and make some plays. Whatever is necessary in the end, whether it is 4 or 5 stops in a row and some hustle plays. I liked our group that started the 4th quarter. They showed some energy and got some stops. That got us going.” (On the play of Jimmy Butler): “I thought he struggled early. He just kept working the game. He probably settled early on. Prince is a tough cover. Jimmy never gets down, he just kept battling and battling. In the end, he figured it out. He got some good shots, some high percentage shots, his defense improved as the game went on. He made some big time plays for us and played some huge minutes.” (Jimmy has shown a knack for being an end of game scorer): “Obviously there are a lot of things Jimmy has to improve on. But he is not afraid of the big moment. He has a lot of courage and toughness. Those characteristics go a long way in this league. He competes on every play. We want him to keep improving and keep studying. In this league at the 2 and 3 spots are the primary scorers and tough match-ups. He is taking the challenge and I like the way he is approaching things. He's never satisfied, he wants to keep improving.” (On Joakim saving the ball at the end): “That was incredible. I don't know how he got to it. It was an incredible play and then Marco making the shot and hitting the free throw. It is big time stuff. Joakim was something. He had 18 rebounds and did not come out in the 2nd half. He made great hustle plays. I thought our team spirit was terrific. That unit that finished the game really inspired us. The whole bench was up and into it. The unit that was out there erased the deficit and got the lead for us.” (On how long you can ride Nate): “That's Nate, that is how he is. He made a lot of big time plays. He is not afraid. I like that about him, I respect that about him. He also has to continue to improve. Our road is going to get a lot tougher so the challenge becomes greater.” Bulls Forward Joakim Noah (On saving the ball on the last play): “The last shot, I'm not even sure who sot the ball, but it came up short. I was going out of bounds. I'm not sure it was the right thing to do. I wasn't hitting it to anyone, just trying to keep it in play. If they get it, it may have been a transition basket. The basketball Gods were with us.” (On the substitutes for the All-Star game being announced tomorrow): “It would be a great honor to be an All-Star. I would love to play in the game, but I don't have any control over that. Right now, I'm just thinking about the team, not individual things.” “We have to keep fighting. We are a team who can stay with anyone as long as we continue to play hard.”",Raw Data

Chiodo told FOXSports.com. ""The blood alcohol levels should roughly reflect what they were at the time of his death."" Chiodo added that Belcher was likely more intoxicated when he took Perkins' life, which occurred less than 30 minutes before Belcher put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger in front of members of the Chiefs’ front office and coaching staff. ""As long as he didn't drink after he took the life of (Perkins), you'd expect him to be more intoxicated,"" Chiodo said. The autopsy also shows that Belcher shot Perkins nine times before he killed himself. The report says Perkins was shot in the neck, chest, abdomen, hip, back, leg and hand. Officers found Belcher sleeping in his idling car about five hours earlier, but let him go inside a nearby apartment to sleep it off. A police report released previously said Belcher had gone out the night before with a woman he was dating on the side while Perkins attended a concert with her friends. Police who found Belcher sleeping in his Bentley outside the woman's apartment told him to turn off the ignition and he complied, the report said. The report said Belcher ''initially displayed possible signs of being under the influence (asleep and disoriented).'' But the report added that after a few minutes of being awake his ''demeanor and communication became more fluid and coherent.'' The report added that officers didn't smell alcohol on Belcher, and that there were no signs of him being ''violent or emotionally unstable.'' Under both city ordinance and state law, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle while intoxicated, city prosecutor Lowell C. Gard said in an email. He said a vehicle doesn't need to be in motion for it to be determined that the person behind the wheel was operating it. ''Operation has been defined in Missouri courts to include a wide range of activity, including sitting behind the wheel of a parked car with the engine running, and sitting alone behind the wheel of a parked car with a warm, but shut off, engine,'' Gard wrote. ''However, problems of proof arise when the arresting officer must provide evidence of that operation contemporaneous with intoxication.'' Kansas City police Sgt. Marisa Barnes said in an email she wasn't aware of anyone being disciplined over the case. Even if they were, she said, she wouldn't be able to discuss it. Belcher asked the officers who found him if he could stay inside the apartment for the night. Belcher tried to call his girlfriend, but she didn't discover the missed calls until the next morning. Two women who were up late invited Belcher to wait inside their nearby apartment after he explained his plight. They said Belcher ''appeared to be intoxicated'' but ''seemed to be in good spirits,'' the police report said. Looking for more dirt on the Chiefs?

Belcher slept on their couch for a couple hours, leaving at 6:45 a.m. so he could make it to a team meeting planned for later that morning. Upon arriving at the home he shared with Perkins, the couple began arguing. Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd, who had moved in with them about two weeks earlier, heard multiple gunshots and ran to the bedroom, where she saw Belcher kneeling next to Perkins' body, saying he was sorry. After kissing Perkins, his baby daughter and his mother, Belcher drove to Arrowhead Stadium. The autopsy said Belcher shot himself in the right temple as coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli looked on. Belcher and Perkins had an infant daughter, Zoe, and their families are fighting for custody of her. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Raw Data

Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates . Well, calls to the bullpen are about to go wireless. Major League Baseball announced Tuesday that its new official wireless sponsor, T-Mobile, will institute an On-Field Communication System beginning with the 2013 season. Dugouts and bullpens across the majors will be equipped with new wireless phones that only work for calls between those two locations. In-game phone use is restricted, so the signal will be cut if devices are taken outside of those areas. Existing wall-mounted phones will remain in place, to accommodate coaching staffs that would like to stay with the mode of communication that has persisted for decades. But now teams won’t have any excuse if their bullpen instructions are mangled because of crowd noise — as happened to the St. Louis Cardinals at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington during the 2011 World Series. Coaches can take advantage of the wireless devices to move to quieter locations within the dugout and bullpen, ensuring that plans are understood correctly.

602,"By Sonia Oxley BRADFORD, England | Tue Feb 19, 2013 9:00pm GMT BRADFORD, England (Reuters) - An excited youngster stocked up on flags for his Wembley trip and the players spoke of fairytales as Bradford City prepared for the last chapter in a giant-killing run that has lifted the gloom around the club. A fourth-tier team featuring a former supermarket shelf-stacker, a cancer survivor and players released by top clubs are hoping to beat a Premier League outfit for the fourth time this season when Bradford take on Swansea City in Sunday's League Cup final. ""It's going to be the biggest game we've played in our lives,"" right back Stephen Darby told Reuters on Tuesday. ""Over the last few years the football club hasn't had a lot to shout about but it's going to be a massive day for everyone, it's great for Bradford City and the people of Bradford."" The Bantams are the first fourth-tier side to reach a major English cup final for 51 years and will be making only their second Wembley appearance - the previous one being the 1996 third-tier playoff final. After several miserable seasons since relegation from the Premier League in 2001, including two spells in administration, the feat of a fourth-tier team beating Arsenal, Wigan Athletic and Aston Villa en route to Wembley is the stuff of dreams. The club, whose only major silverware is the 1911 FA Cup, is also probably best known for tragedy rather than glory after a 1985 fire at its Valley Parade ground killed 56 fans. It is not just the football club that has lived under black clouds. The West Yorkshire city has been harder hit than many by the economic downturn, it has higher-than average crime rates and is also still remembered for race riots in 2001. ""Bradford is known for bad things like riots. There are no shops, there's a lot of negative,"" fan Julia North said after giving her 12-year-old son Liam money to get the club's claret and amber flags. ""It's great there's now something positive."" Thrilled Liam added: ""It means the whole world to me. When we beat Villa (in the semi-final) I just went mental."" There is a buzz around the city with stalls selling anything from paper masks with the face of manager Phil Parkinson to T-shirts emblazoned 'Bradford City Giant Killers Marching on Wembley Way'. One pub near the train station was advertising being open from 0430 on Sunday for anyone wanting ale or food before heading south while the local newspaper is printing cut-out-and-keep posters of the players. FINANCIAL SECURITY The cup run will provide the club with a cash injection of more than two million pounds - an amount that would pay one of the Premier League's top earners around eight weeks' wages but for Bradford that should mean long-term financial security. ""It's the owners' job and my job to make sure this extra revenue is used to keep improving the structure of the club and make sure our supporters have got a football club in years to come that is going to flourish,"" said Parkinson. ""That is really important. Much as we are all going to enjoy this weekend, on the back of that it does give us revenue which we wouldn't have expected to make so we are going to have to use it very wisely."" Lying mid-table in the fourth tier, with 44 points from 31 games, Bradford are punching well above their weight with a group of players who have made up for their lack of big transfer fees with a huge show of determination and a slice of luck. There are no household names, only the likes of striker James Hanson who used to work in a local supermarket and headed the goal that booked the place in the final or Reading reject Carl McHugh who almost never made it as a professional. Their most experienced player is probably goalkeeper Matt Duke, who made Premier League appearances for Hull City and who has recovered after being diagnosed with testicular cancer five years ago. Victory over Swansea would earn Bradford a place in the Europa League, their first continental appearance since the now defunct Intertoto Cup in 2000, and a concept that some players could not get their heads around. ""It would be crazy, it would be mental but it would be unbelievable for the club,"" said McHugh who is taking 111 friends and family with him to Wembley. ""We're going to be underdogs. It's going to take Swansea having an off day and us being right at the top of our game and having a little bit of luck to win it."" The lack of expectation is what forward Alan Connell reckons has been the key to Bradford's successful cup run and that could help them against Swansea. ""I honestly haven't even thought about winning it. It's all a bit of a fairytale,"" he said. ""Being the underdogs has helped us, we're just very relaxed and very disciplined as a team. We've got a game against 11 players, let's go and play."" (Editing by Tony Jimenez)",Raw Data

604,"In typical fashion, Shaun White made this one look rather easy as he cruised to his sixth straight snowboard superpipe crown at Winter X on Sunday night. Sir Sean is fired up about the Bassmasters Classic. (Who wouldn't be?) And he is pretty hyped about these things, too. His top rival, Iouri Podladtchikov, dropped out because of an illness. Instead, White’s biggest challenger was 14-year-old Ayumu Hirano, who became the youngest athlete ever to medal at Winter X when he took silver. Hirano, of Japan, just might be the future of snowboarding — once White relinquishes control, of course. Markus Malin of Finland was third. These days, White’s biggest competition may just be, well, from himself. And even his own performances are getting more and more difficult to top. Last year, White earned a perfect 100 on his final run. He tried the same basic combination of tricks this time and scored only 98. Tough judging, because his run looked flawless. Then again, his performances usually are. On his winning run, White soared a staggering 24 feet into the air, drawing instant roars from the capacity crowd. Then, on his final run, White did something that has become so routine — he took a victory stroll through the pipe. He did a couple of easy tricks and then shut it down near the bottom. Once he stopped, White fell to the snow and covered his goggles with his gloves as if he couldn’t believe he really had just won. Like he really had anything to worry about. The two-time Olympic gold medalist is simply on a different level than everyone else. In the pipe, at least. White is still trying to hone his skills in slopestyle, which will be an Olympic sport next winter at the Sochi Games. He finished fifth the day before — a disappointing result for someone who always expects to be on the podium and usually on the top step. Hardly a surprise, Tucker Hibbert won another SnoCross competition. He’s as dominant on a snowmobile as White is on a snowboard. Hibbert, of Pelican Rapids, Minn., became the first athlete to six-peat at Winter X in Aspen — beating White by hours — and raised his hands as he crossed the finish line. Not bad considering last March Hibbert thought his career might be over when he lacerated his kidney in a crash at a competition. “It definitely made me think twice about what I was doing,” said the 28-year-old Hibbert, who had to lay low for months to recuperate. “But as soon as I was able to ride and train again, I knew there was no choice. It was a long time to be down. It’s all right — I came back strong.” Three-time defending champion Kaya Turski had her reign in ski slopestyle come to an end as 17-year-old Tiril Sjastad Christiansen of Norway captured gold in a crash-marred event. Turski, of Montreal, had to wait more than 30 minutes for her final run after the skier before her, Ashley Battersby, crashed on the course and slid into the fencing. Battersby was carted off on a sled and taken to a local hospital with a knee injury. Before the event even began, Rose Battersby, who’s not related to Ashley, suffered a lumbar spine fracture in a wipeout on a practice run. She was transferred to Denver for more evaluation, but was moving and had feeling in all extremities, according to X Games officials. “It’s really disappointing to hear one of your fellow competitors go down, and you don’t really know what’s going on,” said Turski, who wound up with the silver medal. “We’re keeping things as positive as possible and sending out the best vibes we can.” There have been quite a few spills at Winter X — some minor and some horrific, like when snowmobile rider Caleb Moore clipped the top of a jump during freestyle competition on Thursday. He went over the handlebars and the heavy sled rolled over the top of him. Although he walked off the course, he went to the hospital with a concussion. While there, he developed bleeding around his heart and was flown to Grand Junction for surgery Friday. On Sunday, Moore suffered a “secondary complication involving his brain.” The Moore family released a statement, but provided no further details, only that the rider “continues to be monitored in ICU.” Another scary moment happened Sunday night when a young fan was hurt after a runaway snowmobile veered into the crowd. The teenager was evaluated on site for a right knee injury and released to his father. It’s not clear whether he was hurt jumping out of the way or was struck by the sled. Snowmobiler Jackson Strong tumbled off the snowmobile during the best trick competition. The throttle stuck on the 450-pound machine and it swerved straight toward the crowd — fans scurrying out of the way. The snowmobile came to a rest when it got tangled up in the retaining fence.",Raw Data
605,"After spending two weeks on the West coast, the Pistons' home game against the Heat on Friday is merely a pit-stop before they embark on another four-game road stint. You don’t always sense the mood of a crowd in my job – I’m wearing headphones, concentrating on what goes on between the lines, not focused so much on what’s going on off the floor – but I could feel that Wednesday night was a very, very special night. It might be one of the greatest losses ever at The Palace. Most people walked out of there feeling like it was a win. You’re watching these young kids grow up right before your eyes against one of the most talented teams in the world. It was as close to a win as you could get without a victory. I truly believe we got a glimpse of the future. You look out there at a key stretch in the fourth quarter at a unit with Greg Monroe, Brandon Knight, Jonas Jerebko, Rodney Stuckey and Austin Daye. It takes some players a little longer to grow in to full-time, legitimate NBA rotation players and Austin Daye, I think, is a classic example of that. He’s trying his best to become that solid defender that Lawrence Frank really requires everybody to be if they’re on the floor for him. Austin, somewhere along the line, lost some confidence in his shot. That’s all part of the growth process. This is a great league with great players and even the greatest need their confidence, especially at crunch time. There is so much thrown at a young player and so much of a learning curve that these guys can’t just take it all in in just a handful of games. Sometimes it takes more than one or two seasons. Often a third season is when somebody really comes into his own. Based on what we saw last night, this could be Austin Daye’s season. I see Austin as a guy who, yes, of course, can be a hot shooter like he was in the second quarter when he was 7 for 7, including 4 for 4 from behind the long line, but I also see this guy as a legitimate, everyday shooter. Guys who can score do wonders for a team. You can’t put everything on your defense. If you’re struggling to score, there’s going to be a run against you at some point during the night. Shotmakers take and make shots when they’re there. That kind of guy can make a world of difference on both ends of the court, really. You can’t expect guys to come out and shoot 70 or 80 percent every night, but a shooter is a shooter. He’s always going to make his share over time if he’s feeling good about not just his shot but his game. As he grows more as a defender and all-around player, he’s going to feel better and better about his shot. Speaking of defense, that was a great steal from behind on LeBron James that could have ended up being the play of the game. The other young players – Brandon Knight, Greg Monroe, Rodney Stuckey and Jonas Jerebko – all have their best years in front of them. Everybody goes through this growing process in the NBA and the Pistons are going through theirs now. But when you have a night like the Pistons had against Miami at The Palace and the fans can see what the future looks like, you can also see that this might not be as long a process as the naysayers had predicted. There’s no question our fans were disappointed and maybe wondering if there was light at the end of the tunnel. Those of us who follow the team every day know that of course there was. But it takes a game sometimes like the Miami game to really focus on the future and let fans know it could be right around the corner that this team becomes the kind of team you want to come out and see every time they play at The Palace. For the nice crowd we had last night to see the type of game they saw makes me feel like the crowds are going to get larger and larger as this season goes on. Fans who were there are going to understand that if they want to be in the right seat for the right game a year from now, when this team is starting to emerge, and two years from now, when they’re really starting to become something special, now is the time. That – and the fact that they’re having a great time watching a young team with a future – is going to bring the fans back in droves.",Raw Data

607,"When you look at how this season has gone for the Pistons, you can’t help but look at the timing of moving Jason Maxiell into the starting lineup at power forward and how that move really made everything fall into place for Lawrence Frank’s frontcourt rotation. The power forward position with the Pistons has become one of absolute strength. It took a lot of experimentation before Lawrence decided to start Jason, bring Jonas Jerebko off the bench but give him significant minutes, and let Ben Wallace play significant minutes as the backup to Greg Monroe at center. The results show they were dead-on in terms of what was the right thing to do for this team. The Pistons are 17-14 since Jason began starting at power forward. They’re obviously surging despite facing a tough road trip, but they left on this trip winners of five of six and nine of the last 11 at home. This particular rotation has worked out perfectly. Jason is absolutely at the top of his game. Consistency of minutes – knowing that you’re not only part of the plan, but you’re being counted on to do what you do best and given an opportunity to do what you do best – has been a perfect recipe for Jason. Despite the fact he’s 6-foot-7, Jason’s a classic power forward who can bang with the best. He’s a terror on the offensive boards, a very good shot blocker, and add to that the mid-range jump shot. I always kid him about his feathery jumper. He’s got a great touch. You look at a guy that size, who does that much banging, it doesn’t seem to go together, but it’s a great thing to have in your arsenal. What Greg Monroe has done speaks for itself, which allows Ben Wallace to do what he does best: come in and play consistently great defense – not good, not very good, but great – and do it with his incredible basketball IQ. Then throw in what Jonas Jerebko can give you off of the bench, which on more nights than not is borderline sensational. As his dad Chris told me when we talked before the game against Washington – and Chris played some basketball at Syracuse and over in Sweden before settling down and deciding to make his life there – Jason is a classic power forward and Jonas is probably a three/four, a small forward type of power forward. Jonas runs the court probably as well as anybody who plays that position. He has a real arsenal of offensive weapons. Give him time to get his feet set behind the long line and he’s going to knock down threes. He gets to the basket and jams or finger rolls, he can shoot the short jumper and his big, sweeping hook shot is very reliable. He and Ben Wallace have always had a great chemistry. When those two guys are on the court together – are they are a lot in their roles these days – they make great plays together. The give and go against Orlando in a tight crowd around the basket, where Jonas went inside to Ben with a great pass, made a hard cut to the hole and Ben – the excellent passer that he is – found him with perfect timing for an easy score had the Magic shaking their heads. I love having Jonas around. Let’s give Joe Dumars some props for getting him at pick 39. You don’t get players like that, at that depth of the draft, very often. Both Jonas and Jason pick up their teammates with their style of play. Not only do they pick up their teammates, they pick up the crowd. They’ve had a lot to do with the fact the Pistons have become very, very difficult to beat at The Palace. When Jason makes a big block or a dynamite dunk or one of his patented stick-back slams, the place goes crazy and, of course, his teammates love it. When you have Jonas on the floor, all he does is run the court. I’d say that 20 to 25 percent of his points come from never giving up on a play. If there’s a fast break, he’s always going to be following the play, whether it’s defensively or offensively. He’s liable to get a late shot block or be there for a quick defensive rebound if he’s trying to run somebody down on a break. Offensively, if somehow or other the shot doesn’t go or a last-second pass has to be made, Jonas is there to clean it up. That’s just what he does. I don’t think you can measure what that means to his teammates. He’s more than willing to be assertive offensively, but just like Jason, you won’t see one bit of selfishness in his game. Both those guys want to make the right play, not for themselves, but for the Detroit Pistons. Those two, sharing that power forward position, are a big, big reason why the Pistons have been playing like a playoff team for the past two months.",Raw Data
608,"Dont ridicule Kansas City Chiefs fans. One day soon, you could be in their position, a punch line for uninformed, unsympathetic national media, reduced to begging ownership to act responsibly and fairly, the target of scorn from the very athletes you support, forced to finance your own public-relations campaign. This is where professional sports are headed. The disconnect between local fans and the franchises they love is being powered and accelerated by multi-billion-dollar TV contracts and the billions of ancillary dollars generated by video games and whatnot. The guy in the cheap seats never mattered. Were getting to the point, especially in the NFL, where no one in the stadium matters. Its virtually impossible for an NFL franchise to fail and/or lose money. Before anyone has purchased a season ticket, NFL teams are swimming in enough cash to feed most third-world countries. Thats why Chiefs right tackle Eric Winston got away with slandering a loyal fan base. Thats why the national media delighted in Winstons ridiculous exaggeration. And thats why we opened Sunday morning with a news story that Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli had received a two-year contract extension despite a Matt Millen Lite, four-year run in Kansas City. You remember Matt Millen, right? Many of you laughed at Detroit Lions fans and their Millen Man March to remove their in-over-their-head team president. Millen, despite his ineptitude, was a Supreme Court justice in Detroit. He led the Lions for eight years primarily because theres nothing an NFL executive can do to financially damage a franchise. Looking for more dirt on the Chiefs? Get the inside slant, stats, scores, schedules and more scoops right here. Cincinnati owner Mike Brown has been trying to destroy the Bengals for two decades. He cant do it. At some point, Bengals fans will reach the level of frustration that motivated Lions fans to take to the streets and Chiefs fans to voice displeasure at Arrowhead Stadium. Fans dont have a voice in the mainstream media. That should be clear in the aftermath of the Eric Winston-Matt Cassel-Chiefs fans controversy. The mainstream media are in bed with ownership and athletes, the people media believe they need. Athletes and media believe fans are stupid and unworthy of genuine respect. We think its a waste of time to look at things from the perspective of the average sports fan. Lets apply the bogus logic Winston applied to fans to athletes. Winston claimed that if only a few hundred Chiefs fans cheered when Cassel got hurt that it was still too many and it was still sickening and disgusting. Basically, hes saying if one percent of the fan base does something inappropriate, its worthy of passionate public rebuke and the vilification of an entire fan base. So if one percent of professional football players run afoul of the law, should we vilify all NFL players? Or would that be an unfair generalization? Whats more dangerous, a few cheers when a hometown player gets his clock cleaned or an NFL player driving while drunk? One act leads to potential hurt feelings, the other leads to possible death. MUSH ON! Sean Connery is fired up about the Iditarod. And he is pretty hyped about these things, too. The media and the ex-jocks pretending to be media on TV were having such a fun time beating up on fans that no one applied any critical thinking to Winstons opportunistic stupidity. Not only do fans not have a voice, theyre despised and abused. Winstons whiny, inaccurate rant about the alleged behavior of a handful of Chiefs fans became a national talking point. Well, the story is what has made this fan base this angry. Its the lack of accountability for ownership and management throughout the NFL (and professional sports). As more and more television money pours into professional sports leagues the less power true sports fans have. Were not changing the channel. Sports is the only TV product that is DVR-proof. An NFL franchise is the perfect investment. It makes the owner and his front-office cronies the most powerful and important people in any city. Theyre untouchable. No player in NFL history had an eight-year run of incompetence that could rival Millens. Why would a $3-million-a-year executive face less performance pressure than a $500,000 special-teams player? How could the Chiefs even consider giving Scott Pioli a contract extension? WHO SETS THE CURVE? Check out the FOXiest fans from stadiums across the country and tweet us your photo. Im aware the original report about Piolis extension was refuted later in the day Sunday. But I dont believe Jason La Canfora of CBS reported sketchy information. I believe Tampa Bays 38-10 thumping of Kansas City made the Chiefs walk back the leaked information. Clark Hunt isnt stupid. Kansas Citys fan base is frustrated and motivated. A group of fans started a Twitter feed @saveourchiefs dedicated to getting Scott Pioli fired. In two weeks, the feed has amassed 73,000 followers. Last week the group flew a banner over Arrowhead Stadium demanding that Pioli be fired and Cassel be benched. Theyre planning more activity for KCs next home game on Oct. 28. (I donated $600 to their cause. Im a Chiefs fan.) Extending Pioli at this time would further motivate an already-active fan base. The fan base has taken to social media to educate local and national media about what has been going on with Chiefs football the last two decades and the lengthy list of errors Pioli has made in four years. Theyre tired of reading the propaganda pumped out by Piolis partners in the mainstream media. Don't laugh at their desperation. Don't harshly judge their missteps. You could be next.",Raw Data
609,"Any time there’s a trade during the season in the NBA, it shocks the system of everybody who’s a part of the basketball family. The shock waves go all the way through upper management. There are any number of reasons why the guy you trade for can help an organization both on and off the basketball court, but there’s always some sense of loss for a team when an important player is traded away. It’s obvious that Tayshaun Prince, who has spent his entire career here and won a championship here and made some unbelievable plays to help the Pistons to their 2004 title and two trips to the Finals and six trips to the conference finals, was very readily identified with this franchise and this fan base. But it’s almost inevitable that veteran players are moved. There has even been talk that Paul Pierce could be traded by the Celtics. That’s the nature of the business. It can be painful for a lot of us and for the player, but they signed up for that. I would hope our fans would welcome Jose Calderon here. Here’s another guy who has spent his entire career with one team. It’s hard for me to even imagine Jose Calderon not playing for the Toronto Raptors, just like it’s hard to imagine Tayshaun Prince not playing for the Pistons. But, believe me, once the fans see what Jose Calderon can do and what a pure point guard he is – he may be the purest in the entire league – they’ll warm up to him in a big hurry. And I hope they do, because it’s going to be a difficult transition for him, as well. Any team that has Jose Calderon is going to operate very efficiently on the offensive end. It might not happen overnight, but it will happen a heck of a lot sooner than you think. This guy is all about running your offense as efficiently as humanly possible. And all he wants to do is get his teammates good shots. He’ll take a shot when it’s absolutely necessary. He’s a heck of a shooter and a great free-throw shooter. He could shoot it more and there might be nights Lawrence Frank wants him to, but for the most part he is going to turn on the light for the Pistons on offense. There have been games that have gotten away lately that might look like it’s been the fault of the defense, but when you can’t score after getting a stop and you’re fighting from behind a little bit, suddenly you find yourself fighting from behind by double digits. I don’t think that will happen much once Jose Calderon gets there. The Pistons’ offense will operate with a high degree of efficiency and they’ll be that much more fun to watch. We’ve loved the lob dunks from Will Bynum to Andre Drummond and Will has some great pure point guard instincts, too, although he’s got a scorer’s mentality. You’ll see more of the same from Jose Calderon in setting up Andre and his other new teammates. I think he’s the kind of player that, despite his expiring contract and maybe the thought that we’ll keep him or maybe we won’t, that he’s going to force the Pistons to think long and hard over the summer and look at their options – and he’ll be one of them. In the end, those of us who have known Tayshaun all these years and know what a fine person he is have to thank him for all his hard work and I’ll miss him personally. I know he’ll make big plays in the postseason for Memphis – that’s why they got him. But life goes on in the NBA. I’m excited that Jose Calderon is coming here. He’s really one of the best players that maybe the average fan doesn’t know enough about. Stay tuned – you’re really going to like him. Related Articles: George Blaha",Raw Data
610,"It was coming to the end of the long road trip in late November. The Bulls were the team to beat in Michael Jordans first full season after his 1993 retirement. The Bulls had opened the trip with an overtime win in Dallas, and then they took care of the Spurs, a 62-win team that season working on 59 wins. Then it was a win against the Malone/Stockton Jazz before a loss to the Nuggets, who were on the way to the leagues best record with 64 wins. Then it was a win over a good Portland team. It was about 10 days into the long trip, already with a pair of back to backs and playing the three teams that would have the best records in the Western Conference that season. And now it was on to Canada to play a Vancouver team working on 12 consecutive losses. Everyone among the Bulls had pretty much had it by now, and a Grizzlies team that would be the worst in the league that season with 15 wins was leading in the fourth quarter and about to deliver the five-time champions a brutal loss. Cuonzo Martin, the Purdue player who now coaches the University of Tennessee, made a shot to give Vancouver the lead heading into the fourth and urging the crowd on. Martin also was telling Jordan this was not a night for his team, which we know by now was not a great idea. So Michael Jordan said hed seen enough. Jumper over Byron Scott. Another in the face of Greg Anthony and then a lob slam dunk from Scottie Pippen over Anthony. Putting Bryant Reeves in a poster and then Anthony Avent. Yes, you can see why they lost 67 games. One after another, jumper, fade, dunk, fast break, beating a triple team at the basket. And then it was over, Bulls by six as they went off on a 13-game win streak. Which is also why the Bulls lost to the woeful Charlotte Bobcats Monday. The worth of a great player isnt that he makes game winning shots, though it helps. Greatness is often defined in sports as being consistent, knowing you can count on a player for substantial scoring or rebounding or playmaking every game no matter the circumstances. Thats the greatness of players like Derrick Rose. You dont need a winning shot if you can create some distance between you and your opponent earlier in the game. With Kirk Hinrich out and Joakim Noah suffering from flu, the Bulls Monday were missing two essential parts, especially Noah the way his hustle seems to motivate the other players. Still, the Bulls had tied the game after three quarters, putting themselves in position to escape with a win. But the Bulls as presently comprised dont have that guy like the Bulls once did to allow everyone else to have a bad day. And that Bulls team had Scottie Pippen, a Hall of Famer, and Toni Kukoc, who eventually could be enshrined considering his international play. But none of them could get much going while Jordan was having a quiet game. So Michael understood it had to be him. He finished with 29 points, 19 of them scored in the last six minutes. So Jordan just took over, basically every scoring opportunity going to him as each of the Bulls players on the floor for that game searched Jordan out at every opportunity. They understood theyd had their chance and let it get away. This Bulls team has had some tough losses, like New Orleans, Milwaukee, the Pacers and Celtics at home, all close games. Those are the kinds of game in which a star makes a difference. Rose wouldnt have made any difference in the two losses to the Clippers, who both times overwhelmed the Bulls. But for four or five minutes, players like Jordan and Roseand LeBron and Kobe and Durantcan take the pressure off everyone else and provide a team with enough room and time for the other guys to contribute what they can. Its often not enough to win, but enough to close once you have that cushion. Sure, injuries are part of the game. But not injuries to MVPs. Those injuries you cannot recover from. Sure, other teams have important players out, like the Pacers with Danny Granger, the 76ers with Andrew Bynum, the Knicks with Amare Stoudemire and the Celtics with Avery Bradley But none come close to the impact on their team Rose has with the Bulls. Its to the credit of Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau that he says the team always has enough, which is the appropriate message to the players not to give in. And this Bulls team rarely does. With rare exceptions they compete with everything they have. But the talent isnt there to be elite without Rose. With Hinrich out Monday, it was obvious that Marquis Teague isnt quite ready to run a team and Nate Robinson is best as an energy scorer off the bench in limited minutes as Charlottes small guards gave the Bulls major problems that Rose could have remedied, obviously with offense, but defending their quickness as well. Robinson, by the way, will be around for this season as the Bulls Tuesday guaranteed Robinsons contract for the season. Though Robinson is hardly your ideal point guard, he delivers something the Bulls basically lack, the kind of scorer who can get his own shot off the dribble and get streaky hot. It was difficult to see whom the Bulls could add who would have given them more. So keeping him made sense. Rose is traveling with the Bulls to Orlando and Miami this week, demonstrating hes still a smart guy. He certainly is not close to playing, and its not like he doesnt see the team enough as he works out at the Berto Center. But its a nice break for a few days to be in Miami and know not everyone has to live inside. The Bulls hope to get Hinrich back in Orlando as well as Noahs energy as the Bulls also are in Miami Friday. The Magic played the Bulls tough in a November 6 loss in Chicago. And their center, Nikola Vucevic, is coming off a massive 29 rebounds in an overtime loss to the Heat, who are next to last in the league in rebounding, only ahead of Boston. So the Heat isnt quite dominant yet. But the Bulls uncharacteristically under Thibodeau have been outrebounded seven of the last nine games. So nothing is going to come easy for the Bulls until they see Rose again for more than a nice lunch by the pool.",Raw Data

The German edged out Kimi Raikkonen's Lotus by 0.007 seconds to lead the way as the second winter test commenced. ""The car feels decent out there. That's a good start,"" Rosberg said.

It's a pleasure to drive because it's a lot faster than last year."" Rosberg's only note of caution was over reliability. Gearbox issues meant he only completed 54 laps on Tuesday compared to the benchmark 110 of Ferrari and Fernando Alonso. Mercedes had also suffered from technical issues in the opening test at Jerez. ""I didn't get many laps in,"" Rosberg said. ""That's a bit of a pity, for sure. We have to work on that. ""We have a few too many reliability issues at the moment.

612,"Missouri Topped Blues honor Cardinals legend Stan Musial Blues players wear jerseys before the game against the Minnesota Wild to commemorate St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Famer Stan Musial, who passed away Jan. 19. (Scott Rovak-USA TODAY SPORTS) MAN, OH MAN What a career Stan Musial had. Take a look at his life in pictures . ST. LOUIS — The street hockey records from the 1930's in Denora, Pa., don't seem to exist but if they did, Stan Musial's name would probably have been somewhere on the list. A day after the baseball Hall of Famer was laid to rest after passing away a week earlier at the age of 92, the St. Louis Blues honored Musial by wearing jerseys with his name and No. 6 on the back for pregame warmups prior to their home game against the Minnesota Wild Sunday night. Known as a tremendous athlete who could have success in anything he did, Musial probably ended up picking the right sport. The left-handed hitter played his entire 22-year career with the St. Louis Cardinals and won three MVP awards, seven batting titles and made 24 All-Star teams. Fittingly it was defenseman Wade Redden, who wears No. 6, who scored the first goal of the game to put the Blues up 1-0 midway through the first period of what turned out to be a 5-4 overtime win. ""Just the aura around Busch Stadium, you see the statue and you go to a ball game and it's, ‘Meet at Stan,'"" said defenseman Barret Jackman, who has been in St. Louis since 2002. ""His legend in this town and just what he did, the icon he is away from the field is something that everybody should look for. ""Any time you get to pay respect to such a legend and such a man, you wear it with pride and this organization definitely knows about pride and the guys that paid the way and he was one of them for the Cardinals."" Musial has two statues outside Busch Stadium. The larger and more famous of the two serves as a meeting spot for Cardinals fans before games. Fans have spent the last week putting flowers, notes, baseballs, beer cans and other Musial-related items at the base of the statue. Blues players autographed the jerseys and they were auctioned off during the game to raise money for Cardinals Care, the charity foundation of the Cardinals. Musial was also honored during a pregame ceremony in which his grandson Brian Schwarze, who helped take care of him on a daily basis in recent years, dropped the ceremonial first puck as the crowd stood and cheered wildly. ""Just hearing the stories and the type of guy he was, it was pretty special,"" said Blues goalie Brian Elliott. ""I think this is a great sports town and they honor the greats that have played here so it was pretty cool to see everybody in that No. 6."" Musial is the Cardinals' franchise all-time leader in games played, at-bats, runs scored, hits, total bases, doubles, triples, home runs, RBI, walks and extra-base hits. At the time of his retirement in 1963, he held or shared 17 major-league records. He hit .331 and had 475 home runs and 1,951 RBIs during his career and led the league in doubles eight different times. He finished his career with 3,630 hits — exactly 1,815 at home and 1,815 on the road. Musial is also celebrated for skipping the 1945 season to serve in the Navy in World War II. When he returned a year later, Musial won his second MVP award and led the Cardinals to the 1946 World Series title. ""I know what Tony La Russa said,"" said Blues coach Ken Hitchcock. ""One of the reasons the Cardinals have such a strong following here is because guys like him led the charge and stayed in the city connecting with the fans and making sure that the fans were taken care of. ""I think the healthy respect that the Cardinals have is a lot because of him and a lot of the other players. I think a lot of people followed his lead and I think the current players understand commitment to the community because of stuff Stan did. Tony felt very strongly about that, that's the reason that the players make a connection to the community led by a guy like him.""",Raw Data

Sports opinions? She’s never short of them. And love her or hate her, she’ll be just another one of the boys. Follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook. There used to be a time in my life when talking to the parents of Ravens coach John and 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh in advance of the Super Bowl was simply about gleaning anecdotes, hearing and retelling tales of car rides and family dinners. People always said having kids “changes everything,” but this pretty little euphemism does not do justice to what happens. You go from being a normal person with a healthy balance and perspective to somebody plotting how to get your kid into Harvard, seriously debating tennis versus ballet all while figuring how to intermingle sharks and princesses into a fourth-birthday party theme. So what I really wanted to ask them was, How? In this world of Tiger Moms and tutors for preschool entrance exams, what did Jackie and John Harbaugh do to produce two such high achievers? “I don’t know if we instilled anything, but I think they watched,” Jack Harbaugh, their dad, said. “They observed and they saw things that they liked. And this is the profession that they decided to pursue, and I say that makes me most proud.” In a more emotive moment, he called this “the greatest joy I got in my life.” What I came looking for was a how-to and what I left with was the feeling that we have overcomplicated things in our pursuit of perfect parenting. How two brothers end up coaching each other in the pinnacle of their profession is actually quite simple. Jack did something that he loved passionately, and he included his children daily in pursuit of that passion. “I’d like to say that I think that they took from Jack by watching how he conducted himself, they learned to be who they are in coaching. Not feeling they had to imitate any other coach that they were ever around,” Jackie Harbaugh said. “They are who they are as individuals, and that’s the way Jack was when he coached.” It is much like what Emerson wrote in his 1842 essay, The Over-Soul, “that which we are, we shall teach, not voluntarily, but involuntarily.” We do not hear what our parents say. We hear what they do. We want to pretend our choices do not matter, how we live our lives does not influence what our kids become, but it does. Our kids do not mimic what we say. They mimic what we do. If you want them to be passionate about their work, be passionate about yours. If you want them to love what they do, love what you do. If you want them to be truthful, tell the truth. If you want them to be moral, have morals. We cannot instill that which we do not have in ourselves. And in their dad, John, Jim and Joani Harbaugh found a man who loved coaching. Even now, so many years after his last, you can hear the love and respect he has for the sport. He still very much relates to the pain of losing, a feeling kindled by the Thanksgiving game between San Francisco and Baltimore last year. He remembers walking into the Ravens locker room and saw guys celebrating. He thought, “We are not needed here.” They then walked across the hall to a somber 49ers locker room, where they found Jim by himself, his head down. “That is where we are needed,” Jim recalled. “So that feel of victory and agony of defeat … And we know we are going to experience that next week.” People kept saying “good luck” to Jack, Jackie and Joani, which was confusing because they are not playing or rooting. There will be elation for the Harbaughs on Super Bowl Sunday for sure, but only in direct proportion to their agony. One of theirs will it will realize his biggest dream. One of theirs will have his crushed. It is not their dream. What Jack knew for sure, after years of teaching young men, is the more you try to steer a kid, the more he rebels. So he just included them in the journey — all of them. “I didn’t know I was in a coaching environment,” their sister, Joani Crean, said. “I just felt that was how we lived, that’s what my dad did for a living. Luckily, I think as parents they involved their kids in their professional life.” Joani remembers Jackie loading them into the car and taking them to practice. It was how they saw him after school. She sat at the kitchen table with him coloring his scouting reports. And Jack still calls Joani “the very best hot splicer” he ever had. Hot splicing is back when film was studied was on celluloid 16mm film and had to be manually cut with scissors and put back together. What they learned was not simply Xs and Os but the simple joy of being yourself and liking that person. The story has been told before, many times, how in 1993 Western Kentucky had been talking about cutting the program and instead decided to mortally wound it instead — slashing the budget and coaches. Jack was sitting in his office pouting and talking about how his career was over when Jim walked in. “This doesn’t sound like you,” Jack remembers him saying. “How can I help?” What the story says to me is that Jack and Jackie raised kids who loved them and loved being around them. They took very different paths, Jim playing at Michigan and in the NFL and then landing big-time jobs whereas John thought for a while of becoming a politician. He certainly has the better demeanor for it, the congenial manner he displayed when calling in during the interview and asking, “Is it true you both love Jim more than John?” Once they figured out it was John and everybody was laughing and “I love yous” had been exchanged, it was just a reminder of the difference in the boys. John always was the lesser known of the brothers, but now they are both here. The lesson is that the best thing we can do for our kids is to live a happy, passionate life and to include them in the daily undertaking of that work, whatever it may be.",Raw Data

Click here for more Djokovic is 4/6 to win the Australian Open after beating Federer in straight sets. Can he do it? Bet now. Novak Djokovic inflicted another grand slam semi-final defeat on Roger Federer with a straight-sets triumph over the defending champion at the Australian Open. Third seed Djokovic, who also beat Federer at the same stage of the US Open last year, prevailed 7-6 (7/3) 7-5 6-4 in exactly three hours. After the Serb claimed a tight first set on a tie-break, second seed Federer appeared to have turned the match around when he opened a 5-2 lead in the second. But the Swiss, a 16-time grand slam winner, then suffered complete meltdown, losing five games in a row to hand Djokovic a two-set lead. And Djokovic came through a topsy-turvy third set, breaking for 5-4 and serving out victory on his third match point. The 23-year-old, whose only major title came at Melbourne Park three years ago, awaits the winner of Friday's second semi-final between fifth seed Andy Murray and seventh seed David Ferrer. Serve dominated during the first set, neither player facing even a break point on the way to an inevitable tie-break. Djokovic seized the initiative early in the breaker, racing 4-1 ahead before eventually closing it out 7-3 on his second set point. And he immediately broke at the start of the second set to take total control of proceedings. That stranglehold did not last long, however, as Federer - who entered the match on a 15-game winning streak and leading the career head-to-head 13-5 - produced some inspired strokeplay during a run of four straight games. But Federer's purple patch ended as quickly as it had begun; he was broken twice as Djokovic reeled off the next five games to move within a set of the final. Djokovic remained resolute early in the third set, saving three break points in the third game. He pounced in the next, breaking the Federer delivery for the fourth time in total to move 2-1 ahead. Federer did not lie down and accept his fate, breaking back for 4-4 after a marathon game featuring several deuces but then allowed Djokovic off the hook by surrendering his own serve in the next. That left Djokovic serving for the match and, despite wasting his first two chances, closed out the result on the third attempt. Federer's defeat leaves him without any of the four grand slam titles for the first time since 2003 and, coupled with top seed Rafael Nadal's loss to Ferrer on Wednesday, means Sunday's final will be the first at a major not to feature either Federer or Nadal for three years.",Raw Data

617,"The best football coach in the country will be in Fort Worth this weekend. Of course, TCU coach Gary Patterson usually is. You did not think I was talking about Kansas State coach Bill Snyder, did you? Of course, you did. You can not read about college football nowadays without stumbling upon a paean to Snyder and how he is the smartest, bestest coach because his Wildcats are undefeated and if the BCS does not screw them, which is highly unlikely a contender for the fictional, non-playoff-determined national championship. There is an argument to be made, and I say none of this to diminish him or what he has done. Snyder is 73, on his second go-around in Manhattan, taking a program back over he had built into a power in the 1990s after it had fallen into disrepair and irrelevance after he retired in 2005. This is amazing. But what Patterson has done with TCU borders on miraculous. He raised a program from the dead. He did this without any built-in advantages of being in a BCS conference, already having an established name in coaching, being on TV or really any advantages at all. Snyder, meanwhile, took over a team already in the Big 12 when he returned in 2008, one that shares revenue partially gleaned from Texas and Oklahoma successes, a team that had known football greatness in modern times, had a TV deal that actually had them on channels fans and recruits were able to watch, and has to compete only with lowly Kansas for state dominance. Patterson had none of this. When he took over at TCU, the Horned Frogs were in the Western Athletic Conference. They were within spitting distance of a 1-10 season. Their up-and-coming coach, Dennis Franchione, had jumped ship rather painfully for Alabama. Adding to the awkwardness was the fact that almost everybody in Fort Worth and around TCU agreed Patterson was not who they wanted to hire. The rumor for a while was they only hired him because they felt pressured by a newspaper report saying he had been hired. Hardly anybody believed good was going to come of this. Well, everybody except Gary Patterson. And he attacked this doubt with work. No one was really sold until the first week of 2005, when all of that hard work, all of that emphasis on defense, the steady climb with a few deep bumps was rewarded when TCU went to Norman and beat Oklahoma with Adrian Peterson. The Frogs had finally arrived. The defensive coordinator, who for so long was so unpolished it bordered on awkward, was completing the job that Fran abandoned. It was a football miracle. This is not to imply things turned around quickly or easily. They did not. There was a stop at Conference USA, and then another in The Mountain West, and finally The Big East for about 30 minutes before The Big 12 came calling last year. TCU's facilities had to be practically rebuilt, piece by piece, for this to be a possibility. Fan support had to be regained, both those lost in the previously ugly years of losing and those bored by games against San Jose State and bowl trips to Houston. There was no basketball program of which to speak. The only way to bring back the athletic department, to give them a chance just in case, was the football program. So it was all on Patterson, a guy flawed in the world of politics and all about the football. He buried himself in the work of building a winner, and he did. Faster and better than anybody anticipated. He built them into a team that went to the Rose Bowl and beat Wisconsin, a team that went undefeated, a team that is competitive year in and year out, a team that holds its own recruiting against Texas and Texas A&M and Baylor and Texas Tech and every other program that ravages Texas for its talent. How and why is Patterson. He may not have rules, or stay in his office until 3 a.m., or be 73, or even be a media darling. What he has done, though, is nothing short of a football miracle and that miracle will be a pain in Kansas States butt on Saturday night. Snyder knows this. The Frogs, despite having a shockingly young roster they have played more true freshmen than any other team in the country and a redshirt freshman quarterback who was practicing at running back until the starter was kicked off the team for a DUI, are dangerous. And as they proved a week ago in beating West Virginia, when Patterson decided to go for two and the victory in double overtime, they have guts. Hardly anybody expects TCU to beat Kansas State on Saturday (on FOX). And the Horned Frogs may not. But they have the best coach in the country and that gives them a chance.",Raw Data
618,"I'm an All-Star game guy, going all the way back to when you barely got to see anybody play but the Celtics and Lakers and Knicks, maybe. It was a chance to see Oscar Robertson and some other guys who, in those days, when the NBA was more for aficionados, guys who weren't on mainstream teams – even if they were great players – didn't get much exposure. The Pistons have had a rich All-Star history, going back to Dave Bing and Bob Lanier, who won the 1974 MVP award, and of course to Isiah Thomas, who won two MVPs in the '80s, right up to the 2006 team having four players named by the East coaches. I'll be watching this weekend in Dallas, even though the Pistons, for one of the rare times in their history, won't have anyone in the All-Star game. Jonas Jerebko, though, will be playing in Friday's Rookie-Sophomore game and hopefully he or one of his teammates like Rodney Stuckey or Rip Hamilton or Ben Gordon will be back next year to play on Sunday. This game will make me think about the two games Isiah made his mark as MVP – the 1984 game in Denver, because it's the 25th anniversary of that game, not to mention the 35th anniversary of Bob Lanier's MVP, and also the 1986 game because that one, like this year's game, is in Dallas. It's remarkable that they're talking about putting 100,000 people in the new Cowboys Stadium. You can credit players like Isiah and the guys from that wonderful era of NBA basketball with growing the game's popularity to the point where they could even think about staging this game in the NFL's biggest football stadium. Isiah was one of the guys whose game translated beautifully to not only All-Star games, but important playoff games and, for that matter, regular-season games. He could adapt to situations because his skill level was so high in every area and his basketball IQ was off the charts. He would understand in a heartbeat the situations and what every one of them called for. I recall how K.C. Jones, with the East trailing by seven points with about four minutes to go in that game, put Isiah on the floor with four big men – Larry Bird and Kevin McHale from K.C.'s great Celtics team, plus Buck Williams and Moses Malone, a couple of ultra-rugged rebounders. Isiah led the East on an 18-4 run to close the game. Isiah had 30 points, 10 assists and four steals and the East won going away. Two years earlier, in Denver, he had 21 points, 15 assists and four steals and the East won in overtime. The Pistons hadn't yet closed the gap on Boston in the East by that point, but you could see that when you put Isiah on the floor with other outstanding players, nine times out of 10 it was going to be a win. In big games, not just All-Star games, but the postseason and all the way to back-to-back NBA championships, Isiah would thrive in that environment. The All-Star games during Isiah's era were suddenly magnified. They really became a show. There was a lot of national attention, so there was perhaps a maximum amount of pressure on players in those All-Star games. Of course they needed to play well – they were in the All-Star game, but they also felt like their team needed to win because people were watching not just to see the stars but watching to see who played winning basketball. And think about the all-time great competitors in those games. When you put people like Isiah, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird on the court, they want to win – All-Star game, regular season, playoffs or preseason. So they made those games competitive and not just a showcase for the stars. We looked forward to those All-Star games not just to see our guys play in it, because that validated our favorite teams and players as fans, but we looked at those games as potentially great drama. I can't tell you how great it was, way back when, to see Bob Lanier play at the Silverdome the one time the Pistons hosted and hear Brent Musburger introduce Bob Lanier as the heart and soul of the Pistons. All of us who were part of the Pistons family knew that, but it was nice for the world to hear it. When you moved on to the Bad Boys days, to see Isiah and Joe D and Kelly Tripucka and Bill Laimbeer represent the Pistons on that stage, it gave all Pistons fans a lot of pride. And just about the time you think it can't get any better, it does. That's why the All-Star game is still important and a wonderful showcase for the NBA. The Pistons were an underpublicized, hard-working, great basketball team and they won a title and had a near-miss the next year. Who knows? They probably were good enough to win multiple titles, but the cards didn't fall that way. But no one can ever take away the championship and the day when four Pistons checked into the All-Star game. When they were waiting at mid-court, if you didn't feel a sense of pride, then you really didn't bleed Pistons blue. I was so proud of Ben and Rasheed and Chauncey and Rip. God bless the fans – they deserve the vote. But those guys were put into the game by a vote of the coaches and there's a respect factor there you can't ignore. It was a red-letter day for the Pistons and one none of us will ever forget – just like we won't ever forget the MVP award Isiah Thomas took home the last time the NBA played this game in Dallas.",Raw Data
619,"Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers really think they're on to something, even if it's nothing revolutionary. They're gaining confidence in their newfound attitude and approach with each victory they're producing. Not even a fantastic fourth-quarter rally by the New Orleans Hornets could shake Kobe's conviction that the Lakers have finally figured out a few things about their puzzling season. Dwight Howard scored 24 points, Bryant had 14 points and 11 assists in another pass-first performance, and the Lakers hung on to beat New Orleans 111-106 Tuesday night for their first three-game winning streak in five weeks. Earl Clark had 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Lakers (20-25), who jumped to an 18-point lead midway through the fourth quarter with their third straight game of patient passing and hard-nosed defense quarterbacked by Bryant. The fifth-leading scorer in NBA history has warmly embraced his new role as a playmaker - no surprise for somebody whose first basketball muse was Magic Johnson. ''It's working pretty well,'' said Bryant, whose 39 assists in the Lakers' last three games are the biggest three-game total of his 17-season career. ''It's very easy for me to look over the defense and know where they're coming from, just kind of line my guys up in the right way and just pick them apart.'' With Bryant running the show, the Lakers even survived a frenetic finish. Their lead dwindled to 102-101 with 2 minutes left shortly after an electric 16-2 run in a 2 1/2 minute stretch by the Hornets, but Clark hit a layup and Steve Nash calmly buried a 3-pointer with 1:21 left to clinch Los Angeles' ninth straight win over New Orleans. Nash had 12 points and five assists, while Antawn Jamison scored 16 points. Four-time All-Star Pau Gasol had seven points, seven rebounds and seven assists as a reserve in the Lakers' final home game before a seven-game trip, their longest of the season, while the Grammy Awards take over Staples Center. The trip should be daunting for the Lakers, who have lost 15 of 20 on the road this season, including seven straight since Christmas. Instead, they're optimistic about trying out their new approach in a hostile environment. ''We're doing a good job of not being selfish, and of doing whatever we can to help our team win,'' Howard said. ''Things are clicking for us. Our offense is a lot smoother, and on defense we're really holding each other accountable.'' Sounds simple - but the Lakers have rarely looked this good in their complex season. Eric Gordon scored 18 of his 25 points in the first half for the Hornets, who got within one point on Greivis Vasquez's running jumper. Ryan Anderson scored 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for the Hornets, who had won eight of 12, including an impressive victory in Memphis two nights earlier at the start of their five-game trip. Anderson, Vasquez and Robin Lopez led the impressive late rally that just fell short, with Lopez finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds. ''We're a young team that's still building chemistry, and to come back like that is a really good confidence boost for the guys,'' said Gordon, a Staples Center favorite in his career with the Clippers. ''We had a chance to win. We were getting a lot of stops and were scoring at will. It just boiled down to the final plays.'' Rookie Anthony Davis had 18 points for the Hornets, who haven't beaten the Lakers at Staples Center since January 2009. Bryant reached new statistical heights in his revamped role, racking up 10 assists in three straight games for just the fifth time in his career and the first time in four years. Bryant also had eight rebounds, falling just short of a triple-double for the third straight game. Two days after beating Oklahoma City in impressive fashion, the Lakers got right back to their improved form in the first half, holding the Hornets scoreless for 7:41 spanning the first two quarters with a 17-0 run. ''Even though we were down 18, we should have won the game,'' Vasquez said. ''It's hard losing like that, but I thought we battled. We just can't get down by 18. We can't allow us to do that to ourselves. We've got to bring the juice from the beginning. We're good enough to beat anybody if we just play with energy. If we don't play with energy, it's going to be a long night.'' Notes: The Hornets' brutal road trip began in Tennessee and will eventually take them to Minnesota for their fourth game in five nights on Saturday. They'll be at Utah on Wednesday night. ... Steve Blake had two points and four assists in the veteran guard's first appearance for the Lakers since Nov. 11. He had missed the Lakers' past 37 games with an abdominal injury that required surgery and resulting groin problems. ... The Lakers missed four free throws in less than 1 second of clock time midway through the third quarter. After Howard missed two, Gasol grabbed the rebound and got fouled without the clock moving - but Gasol then missed two as well. Clark collected that rebound, but threw it past Bryant for a backcourt violation.",Raw Data
620,"Muhammad Ali had a knockout of a 71st birthday, celebrating with friends and family and watching a video of his ''Rumble in the Jungle'' win over George Foreman in Africa. Where do Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali rank among the best boxers of all time? Ali's former business manager, Gene Kilroy, said the fighter - who has long suffered from Parkinson's - particularly enjoyed a big birthday cake in the celebration Thursday at his home in a gated community just outside Phoenix. ''It was good to see him in great spirits and looking so good,'' Kilroy said. ''He's very comfortable in his Parkinson's body. As he said many times, it could be worse.'' Kilroy said Ali's eyes lit up as he watched the video of himself knocking out Foreman in the 1974 fight in what was then Zaire. Foreman had been a big favorite in the fight, but Ali stopped him in the eighth round in one of the great upsets in heavyweight history. ''He was all excited watching it,'' said Kilroy, who was with Ali in Zaire for the fight. Kilroy said Ali's wife, Lonnie, her sister, Marilyn, and other family members were on hand for the birthday. Ali's children, he said, all called to wish him well, though he is unable to talk on the phone. ''Thankfully he has Lonnie to look out for him and take such good care of him and Marilyn is devoted to him,'' he said. Also at the house was Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, a longtime friend of the former heavyweight champion, Kilroy said. The birthday was in contrast to Ali's 70th birthday, which was celebrated with a series of lavish events, including a party in Las Vegas that raised money for Parkinson's research. Kilroy said Ali likes to watch his old fights, and the interviews he did during his time as the most celebrated athlete in the world. ''I joked with him and said George Foreman called and said he wanted a rematch,'' Kilroy said. ''He kind of smiled.''",Raw Data
621,"Piero Alva of top flight side Union Comercio was completely unashamed as charged up to pounce on the loose ball when Cesar Vallejo's goalkeeper Juan Flores collapsed to the turf in his own goal area. One of Vallejo's defenders spotted the astonishing run and tried to make a clearance, but Alva coolly intercepted to deflect the ball into the net to make it 3-1 to his team with 20 minutes left. Even Alva's team-mates were shocked at his callousness, since Flores's collapse bore the hallmarks of a player suffering heart failure. But the player himself was totally unrepentant: ""Football is for the living"" he said afterwards when asked. ""As far as I'm concerned this is simply a blooper by them and should be considered as such. It's clear that the mistake was made by them. ""If he was injured or had fallen ill, why didn't he leave the field? Any goalkeeper knows that if they are hurt they have to get the ball off the pitch,"" he told newspaper Depor. Comercio ended up winning the match 3-1 and Flores, who had been overcome by heat exhaustion, was ultimately able to continue playing. Alva has been vilified in Peru for his shocking lack of sportsmanship, however - though it turns out that there was more to the incident than initially meets the eye. The two players were team-mates at Universitario a few years ago, but apparently loathed each other throughout their spell sharing a dressing room.",Raw Data
622,"Wise Dan won 5 of 6 starts in 2012, winning the Breeders' Cup Mile in course-record time and two other Grade 1 turf stakes. ''I can't tell you why, or people say, `What have you done?' It's just the horse,'' trainer Charlie Lopresti said. ''He just got really good this year.'' Wise Dan received 194 votes in balloting by the National Thoroughbred Association, Daily Racing Form and National Turf Writers and Broadcasters to easily outdistance I'll Have Another (30) and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Fort Larned (12). ''The whole thing seems like a miracle to me,'' 83-year-old owner Morton Fink said. ''Sometimes over the years, you have decent horses and something always goes wrong sooner or later. This year and last year, just unbelievable.'' Wise Dan became the first gelding to win Horse of the Year since John Henry in 1984. He also became the first horse to sweep Horse of the Year, top older male and top male turf horse honors since John Henry in 1981. ''People have been telling me for the last month that he's got a chance to win all three. I didn't know if I believe that,'' Lopresti said. ''You want to believe it because you believe in your horse and you like your horse. It was just amazing that he did that.'' Wise Dan's lone defeat in 2012 was by a head in the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs, where he gave weight to winner Ron the Greek. It wasn't until this past summer at Saratoga and the ensuing races that Lopresti truly realized the quality of horse he had. ''Every race that he came out of, he acted like he never ran it,'' Lopresti said. ''I'd take him to the track in two of three days and it was like he never ran.'' I'll Have Another won all four starts, including the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. He was scratched from the Belmont Stakes because of a tendon injury that led to his retirement. ''Another year, I'll Have Another could have won all three awards. He just had the bad luck of running with Wise Dan in the same year,'' Fink said. Lopresti was asked if the Horse of Year could expect a reward from his trainer for being Horse of the Year. ''He did get a reward: He got 60 days off,'' Lopresti said. ''Most horses don't get to go home and roll around in the paddock. They'd be down here training right now.'' Other winners included Zagora as top female turf horse, Royal Delta as top older female, Dale Romans as outstanding trainer, Ramon Dominguez as outstanding jockey, Godolphin Racing LLC as outstanding owner and Darley as outstanding breeder. Dominguez, who suffered a fractured skull in a spill Friday at Aqueduct, won for the third straight year. He set a North American thoroughbred racing earnings record with $25,582,252 and had 341 wins from 1,398 mounts despite missing nearly two months because of neck and foot injuries. Fellow jockey nominees John Velazquez and Javier Castellano accepted the award on Dominguez's behalf. ''We're very proud to be here,'' Velazquez said. ''We have (Ramon) in our prayers, and, hopefully, he'll be back soon to be in competition with us.''",Raw Data
623,"Real Madrid are now determined to cash in on the club's £80m record signing, while Ronaldo's value is still at its peak. According to reports in Spain, Real president Florentino Perez has finally grown fed up with the Portuguese forward's refusal to sign a new contract. The 28-year-old's current contract expires in June 2015, with Ronaldo claiming he is ""sad"" at the Bernabeu earlier this season. The former Manchester United star also recently stated his intention to see out the remainder of his contract at Real, but claimed ""I do not know what will happen in the future"". Spanish newspaper El Pais reports it is these recent comments which have most angered Perez. And the Real chief is now determined to cash in on the club's £80m record signing, while Ronaldo's value is still at its peak. It is thought Perez will not even consider retaining Ronaldo to the end of his contract and allowing him to walk away for free. Real will need the money from the sale of their prize asset to fund a replacement. And Perez is also keen to splash out on an overhaul of the Real squad this summer, as he faces a presidential re-election campaign in upcoming months. With boss Jose Mourinho and Ronaldo sharing the same agent in Jorge Mendes, Perez suspects it is Ronaldo's representative who is behind his continued snub of a new £26m per year contract. Relations between Mourinho and the Real board have soured recently, following the manager's public fall-out with a number of the club's stars. And Mourinho is set to leave the Spanish capital in May, with Perez wanting to back any new manager with substantial transfer funds. Tottenham's Gareth Bale and Manchester City's David Silva are top of the list of Real's summer targets, along with Malaga starlet Isco and Brazil phenomenon Neymar. Ronaldo has suitors in cash-rich French side PSG, with Manchester rivals City and United both likely to be interested in discussing a deal for the world-class talent.

624,"''We know what's the right way,'' St. Louis said. ''I thought tonight we played the right way.'' Tampa Bay also got goals from Eric Brewer, Vincent Lecavalier, Victor Hedman and Steven Stamkos. St. Louis has eight assists and 11 points this season. ''We're spreading the offense pretty good right now,'' Stamkos said. ''We're not forcing things to certain players. We're making the right play.'' The Lightning continued their season-long domination of the third period - outscoring opponents 13-1 - with goals by Hedman and Stamkos. Sean Couturier scored for the Flyers, who were coming off a 7-1 win at Florida on Saturday night. Backup goalie Michael Leighton played in his first NHL game since appearing in two playoff games for the Flyers in 2011. ''They had a step on us,'' Flyers coach Peter Laviolette said. ''They were a more rested team with better jump tonight than we were. We had moments and opportunities where we could have scored, but when you play tight defensive teams, it takes a lot of energy to try and create offense. We didn't generate enough.'' Brewer made it 2-1 on his third goal this season, a slap shot from above the right circle with 3:50 left in the first. The defenseman had one goal in 82 games last season. The Lightning converted another power play for a 3-1 lead when Lecavalier scored from the right circle 65 seconds before the first intermission. St. Louis assisted on all three first-period Tampa Bay goals. After Hedman had a rebound goal 58 seconds into the third, Stamkos gave Tampa Bay a 5-1 advantage with 7:31 to play. ''When you get a little confidence going, as our offensive players have right now, you try to run with it,'' Stamkos said. ''We know, once we get on a roll, we're a tough team to beat.'' Couturier put the Flyers up 1-0 just 59 seconds into the game when his shot from the corner along the goal line eluded goalie Anders Lindback. ''You saw that goal, it's something that shouldn't go in,'' Tampa Bay coach Guy Boucher said. ''Then right after, he just made some crazy saves. At some point he just shuts the door, and that's the mark of great goaltenders.'' The Flyers went 0 for 6 on the power play, and could generate just one quality scoring chance during a 4-minute first-period man advantage after taking the 1-0 lead. ''I don't know if it was so much them or if it was us,'' Philadelphia right wing Wayne Simmonds said. ''We didn't get too many shots through. They blocked a lot of shots tonight. I think we could have been better. We didn't get anything going there.'' Notes: Lecavalier also had a first-period fight with Flyers D Luke Schenn. It was Lecavalier's first fighting major since Feb. 3, 2009. ... Philadelphia is sending C Scott Laughton, taken 20th overall in the 2012 amateur draft, back to Oshawa of the Ontario Hockey League. He was pointless in five games with the Flyers this season. ... Stamkos, who also had an assist, extended his season-opening point streak to five game. He has seven assists and 10 points overall. ...

625,"In January, the Belfast Giants of Britain's Elite Ice Hockey League announced that American Christopher Knight had purchased the team, as Jim Gillespie sold a stake he had held since 2003. It was supposed to be a new era for the Northern Ireland team. Alas, it was an era that ended only a few weeks later when it was revealed that Knight was actually a registered sex offender in Florida. Knight, who made his money in the telecommunications industry, purchased the team for a reported £145,000 in November, entering into an agreement with the Odyssey Trust, which owns and operates the Odyssey Arena. According to The Independent, Odyssey activated an out clause in its contract with the Giants after ""major issues"" about Knight came to light. Like the fact he was charged in 2003 with engaging in sexual activity with ""a person 12 years of age or older but less than 16 years of age."" Which, as you might imagine, isn't exactly the image the Belfast Giants are going for. This means he is alleged to have engaged in sexual activity with a person aged between 12 and 15, and he remains on the sex offenders register. You may notice that Knight is listed as being close to 40 years old. When he purchased the team, it was announced he was 34. But then again, there was a bit he wasn't up front with. A deadline was set for last Friday for Knight to sell the team, and it passed. From the Independent: At that point the trust terminated the holding agreement - a move which meant the company owned by Mr Knight - Belfast Giants (2008) Ltd - could no longer play at the Odyssey Arena. Within hours of that, the players wrote to Mr Knight claiming that their contracts were no longer in effect. The squad went on to play two games over last weekend - one of which was a charity fundraiser - on the understanding they were not contracted to any team. “We became aware of major issues relating to the new owner of the Belfast Giants on February 1st. We immediately moved to protect the Odyssey complex by conditionally terminating the Belfast Giants (2008) Ltd’s contract to play at the Arena while entering into a without prejudice agreement to ensure the team continued with its games and its commitment to the league and its fans until the end of the season. “The Belfast Giants has been one of the most successful sports teams in Northern Ireland and an integral part of the success of the Odyssey Arena. Since this news emerged, we have done all in our powers to protect the integrity of the team and ensure the future of professional ice hockey in Belfast. Last week we offered to purchase the assets of Belfast Giants (2008) Ltd , this was not responded to leaving us with no alternative other than to secure the name and brand of the team and create a new company structure by which the team could continue to play. Today, the entire staff including players and administrators will be signed to an Odyssey Trust owned company permitting the team to finish the season and continue the battle to retain their title. “This has not been an easy period for the Belfast Giants but it is highly commendable that the players, who were without contracts, fulfilled their commitment to the team’s two games this past weekend including helping to raise money for the team’s nominated charity at the match on Friday evening. We would also like to assure the loyal Belfast Giants’ fans that we are committed to protecting the excellent reputation and long-term future of the team.” So, in essence, Christopher Knight owns a team that doesn’t have any players or an arena in which to play. Because his players and managerial staff collectively resigned.",Raw Data
626,"Cub Swanson, who faces Dustin Poirier in a much-anticipated featherweight bout at Wembley Arena a week on Saturday, revealed he felt insulted by the newly-created UFC rankings published this week. The American, who stormed through 2012 with three victories by knockout, has no issue however with Anthony Pettis gaining an immediate title contender fight against champion Jose Aldo, after offering to step down from lightweight. It is what it is [Pettis getting the title shot against Aldo in August], he told me this week. I expect to be in the title mix in the next 8 to 10 months, but I dont think about it too much. Its going to come. Ive endured a lot, and Im still here. Its my time. Im firing on all cylinders, Im stepping into my prime, and whether I get it this year, next year, or the year after, its going to happen. Thats my goal. Initially due to face Dennis Siver at Wembley on Feb 16, that changed when the Russian suffered a training camp injury. Poirier was immediately inserted in the blank. At first I was bummed when the fight was called off, but when they gave me the name I thought it was cool. Hes a tall southpaw and Ive been wanting to face different opponents with different styles. This is a fight I wanted. But the newly-released UFC media rankings rankled with him. I didnt agree with them. I didnt feel Dennis Siver should have been ahead of me. And I didnt feel that the Korean Zombie [Chan Sung Jung] should be ahead of me. Swanson is currently ranked at No 6, with Chan Sung Jung No 3 and Siver No 5. I dont feel like Dennis Siver did enough to get up that high, he wasnt ranked that high in the lightweight division. And he hasnt fought the toughest guys. And I feel the same with the Zombie. So where does he see his contest between himself and Poirier in the division. No 2 versus No 3 ? I don't know. Poirier was up there but after he lost, he got bumped back a bit, but I feel hes definitely top 10. I feel I should definitely be ranked higher than him right now. Seeing as my only loss in the UFC is to Ricardo Lamas, I should be higher. People write that I got destroyed by Lamas, but if you look back at that fight, I was winning it, but I made a mistake, and he caught me. Ive worked not to let that happen again. Those three wins three knockouts of Charles Oliveira, Ross Pearson and George Roop in 2012 have brought Swanson a maturity, a greater calmness in preparation for fights. I used to want to be the toughest dude out there, I dont feel thats necessary any more. Ive proved Im tough. I can be an intelligent fighter. It makes for a better overall fighter, he explained. Ive been able to outsmart my opponents, and thats the reason Ive been winning. Ive been throwing those power shots when its right to finish them. Im training smarter. Swanson leaves for the UK tomorrow, intent on fully acclimatizing to the time difference from his native Palm Springs, California, over a full week in London. I used to be miserable for a whole week before the fight, so I intend to enjoy myself for a week in London before the fight. As long as the weather is good. One thing Ive learned, taking a page out of Clay Guidas book after training with that guy, is to enjoy your time in the UFC. Every minute of it. Im not going to turn into a mean animal until the day of the fight. I dont have a problem turning the switch, he explained.",Raw Data
627,"The result provided the perfect stopping point ahead of the World Cup qualifying travails on tap next weekend and showed how many of the teams involved still harbor reasonable hopes of a place in the quarterfinals. Securing one of those eight spots varies in difficulty depending on the group and the performances submitted. Some of the favorites from MLS and Liga MX have sailed through the opening few matches to all but guarantee a berth in the knockout stages, while other fancied sides have found their expected quarterfinal place under severe threat from Central American upstarts. Plenty of time remains to rectify those concerns during the second half group play, but the margin for error remains thin. Only one side from each three-team group will progress to the quarterfinals and all eight of those teams will be seeded according to their records during this stage of the competition. The battle for positions will intensify as the group stage matches dwindle. FOX Soccer evaluates where the teams stand on their quest at this interval and takes a look at how the second half of group play might unfold in this group-by-group review. Santos Laguna (2-0-0, 6 pts.) secured the most important result of the week with a 3-1 victory over Toronto FC (1-1-0, 3 pts.) at BMO Field on Tuesday night. The beaten finalists from 2011-2012 now sit in pole position to qualify for the quarterfinals with a superior goal difference (+7 to TFC's + 2) in hand and the critical return match with the Reds slated for Estadio Coroña on Oct. 24. If both clubs continue to dispatch Salvadoran side Águila (0-2-0, 0 pts.) with ease, then the Canadians must win in Mexico to retain any hope of progressing to the quarterfinals. TFC's 6-2 defeat in Torreón in the second leg of a contentious semifinal tie against Santos earlier this year suggests that task may prove too difficult. Tauro FC (0-2-0, 0 pts.) nearly upset the established order in Panama City on Thursday night, but Waylon Francis struck from distance three minutes after halftime to keep Herediano (2-0-0, 6 pts.) atop the group with a 1-0 victory. Real Salt Lake (1-1-0, 3 pts.) hoped for an upset to bolster its cause. Instead of receiving a bit of help, RSL must take now care of business in Panama on Sept. 18 to presumably set up a winner-take-all affair against the Costa Ricans at Rio Tinto Stadium on Oct. 23. Jason Kreis' side could go through with a victory in that match if it manages to overturn its current goal difference deficit (+1 to Herediano's +2) along the way. Adam Moffat's 57th minute header handed 10-man Houston (1-0-1, 4 pts.) a 1-1 draw at Olimpia (1-0-1, 4 pts.) on Thursday night and made the Dynamo favorites to progress out of the group. Dominic Kinnear's side will play its final two group matches at BBVA Compass Stadium, including the potentially decisive affair against the Honduran giants on Oct. 23. A pair of victories in Texas would ensure the Dynamo's spot in the quarterfinals. Bottom side FAS (0-2-0, 0 pts.) won't influence the outcome without a substantial uptick in form. Seattle (2-0-0, 6 pts.) sits in the best position of any group leader heading into the second half of the group stage. A professional 3-1 victory over Caledonia AIA (0-2-1, 1 pt.) in Couva, Trinidad on Thursday night increased Seattle Sounders' lead atop the group to five points. Marathón's inability to claim maximum points in a 0-0 draw at the Ato Boldon Stadium on Aug. 22 left the Hondurans (0-0-1,1 pt.) with a mountain to climb in their pair of matches against Seattle. If Sounders can win in San Pedro Sula on Sept. 19, then they would guarantee a berth in the quarterfinals and permit Sigi Schmid to field a reserve side in the last group fixture (Oct. 24 at CenturyLink Field) scheduled during the final week of the MLS regular season. A pair of home victories leaves Los Angeles (2-0-0, 6 pts.) in control of its own destiny after the first half of group play. Bruce Arena's young guns brushed aside Puerto Rico Islanders (0-2-0, 0 pts.) 4-0 on Wednesday night to give the Galaxy some latitude heading into the final two group games. The visit to Isidro Metapán (1-1-0, 3 pts.) on Oct. 25 presents the most peril for the Galaxy, but a victory in Bayamon on Sept. 19 would make the voyage to El Salvador less treacherous. Metapán must win in Puerto Rico on Sept. 27 and peel away some of Los Angeles' significant goal difference edge (+7 to -1) along the way to preserve any hope of knocking the Galaxy out on the final day. LD Alajuelense (1-0-1, 4 pts.) kept pace with Tigres UANL (1-0-1, 4 pts.) at the top of the group with a 1-0 victory over Real Estelí (0-2-0, 0 pts.) in Nicaragua on Tuesday night. Allen Guevara's 42nd-minute strike ensured the Costa Ricans did not drop points at the Estadio Independencia, but Tigres remain favored to emerge out of the group despite allowing a 91st minute equalizer in their 2-2 draw in Costa Rica on Aug. 22. The rematch between the top two sides in the group will take place at Estadio Universitario on Oct. 24 and will decide the quarterfinal entrant unless Estelí somehow nicks a point along the way. Humberto Suazo preserved Monterrey's unblemished record through two matches with a 79th minute winner against Municipal (1-1-0, 3 pts.) in Guatemala City on Wednesday night. The two-time defending champions (2-0-0, 6 pts.) look like heavy favorites to progress to the quarterfinal stage with the most difficult away fixture now out of the way. A second consecutive victory over the Guatemalans on Sept. 25 would end all doubt with Panamanian minnows Chorrillo (0-2-0, 0 pts.) unlikely to influence the proceedings in any way. The shock of the competition to date came when heavy underdogs Xelajú (1-0-1, 4 pts.) defeated out-of-form C.D. Guadalajara (1-1-0, 3 pts.) in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala on Aug. 21. Edgar Chinchilla's 67th-minute header handed Hernan Medford's side a famous win and restored the possibility of a spot in the quarterfinals after a 2-2 at W Connection (0-1-1, 1 pt.) to start group play. Chivas will hope to derail those dreams and salvage a spot in the knockout stages with a pair of victories in the second half of group play. The 4-0 home triumph over the Trinidadians on Wednesday night started the atonement process, but two further wins – including a victory in the critical home tie against Xelajú on Oct. 25 – must follow in order to avoid further embarrassment.",Raw Data

630,"CALLUM McMNERVE ANAMAN helped put the Latics into the FA Cup last eight with a nerveless display thanks to Roberto Martinez and his mind games. Forget the Road to Wigan Pier, its the road to Wembley for the Premier League strugglers. Wigan sauntered into the quarter-ﬁ nals for the ﬁ rst time in 26 years as new Town and ex-Coventry boss Mark Robins was dumped out of the cup for the second time in just over a month. But boss Martinez is ready to write another chapter in the towns rich history, with one more win sealing an FA Cup semi-ﬁ nal spot at Wembley. The Latics face a sixth-round trip to Everton or Oldham after a McManaman inspired victory and Martinez said: ""We made a few changes and I was proud of the players. Callum gets so nervous before games I told him he wasnt playing the day before, so he wouldnt be upset overnight and could concentrate on having a good nights sleep.

James McArthurs measured through ball cut out Jack Hunt to ﬁnd McManaman bearing down on goal inside the area and the winger calmly cut inside to beat keeper Alex Smithies six yards out from a narrow angle for his second goal of the season. The 21-year-old Scouser is yet to make a league start this season but on this show he could be worth his weight in gold to Wigans hopes of beating the drop. Arouna Kone doubled the lead on 40 minutes with Huddersﬁeld in more defensive disarray. Not for the ﬁrst time Hunt was left for dead by McManaman, who cut the ball back for Jordi Gomez to see his shot saved by Smithies and Kone followed up to tap in. Town showed signs of life after the break, throwing on James Vaughan and Lee Novak for Alan Lee and Chris Atkinson. McArthur rounded off a man-of-the-match display by crashing home the third with an arrow-straight angled drive into the top corner from 15 yards. Novaks header from a Calum Woods cross found the net just after the hour to pull one back but Kone sealed the win a minute from the end, pouncing on another defensive mix-up to leave Peter Clarke and Anthony Gerrard trailing as he powered home the fourth from 10 yards. Robins, who went out with Coventry at Spurs in round three, now faces tomorrows Championship trip to Nottingham Forest. He said: ""We made more of an impression in the second-half but wed given ourselves too much to do by then because Wigan caused us a lot of problems.""",Raw Data
631,"Ok, so the Red Sox are not realistically playoff contenders, but they have a $147M payroll as of right now, which will probably put them in the top 5 in MLB. GM Ben Cherington has not been shy about making sweeping changes to his roster, as evidenced by the blockbuster trade last August. Cherington jettisoned high salary players (Josh Beckett, Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez) for journeyman James Loney and prospects Jerry Sands, Ivan DeJesus Jr. and Rubby De La Rosa. Sands and DeJesus were shipped off as a part of a package to get closer Joel Hanrahan. Oh yeah, the Red Sox also signed a load of free agents including Shane Victorino, Jonny Gomes, Ryan Dempster and Mike Napoli. The front office in Boston has definitely been busy. The question is, will it translate to wins? For the answer to that, let’s start with their lineup. I always like to look at hitters that scare the opposing team. The Red Sox have 3 1/2 guys who fall into that category for me (Ortiz, Napoli, Pedroia and Ellsbury, when healthy). Pedroia has a career slashline of .303/.369/.461. He was off that pace last year while dealing with various hand and muscle injuries. The 2008 MVP is only 29 years old and is the emotional leader of this club. It will fall on Pedroia to welcome in serious long ball threat Mike Napoli. While Napoli’s hip condition likely means the end of his days behind the plate, and reduced his 3 year deal to a one year deal, Napoli has a chance to show that he is healthy and he can still deliver a home run 6% of his at bats. Big Papi has battled injury and ineffectiveness over the past few seasons. He’s also battled through them to provide a potent bat to a power-starved lineup. I think Ortiz can continue to contribute albeit with fewer at bats. I think the Red Sox protect him with a generous dose of days off. Seeing him healthy for an entire season will mean more quality at bats. Ellsbury is such an enigma. When he’s healthy, as he was in 2011, he can fill up the box score like few others. He posted a .321/.376/.552 slash line in 2011 coupled with 39 stolen bases. The problem with Ellsbury is that the years on either side of that dominant campaign were marred by long stints on the DL and other minor nagging injuries. He’s scary when he’s in the lineup, unfortunately for the Red Sox, that hasn’t been as often as they’d like. Ellsbury’s injuries and pending (expensive) free agency has the front office’s ears open on potential trades. The Red Sox do have top prospect Jackie Bradley waiting in the wings for when Ellsbury moves on. I wonder what kind of trade market there would be for Ellsbury. Taking a look at a comparable deal would lead me to the recent Justin Upton deal that sent Upton and 3B Chris Johnson to the Braves for Martin Prado, and prospects RHP Randall Delgado, RHP Zeke Spruill, SS Nick Ahmed and 1B Brandon Drury. For someone with an attractive contract and huge upside like Upton’s, it’s hard to believe that they couldn’t have gotten more for him. Taking that information and applying it to Ellsbury, I don’t think the Red Sox will be able to get a package that provides as much value as Ellsbury. If the Red Sox are out of the playoff hunt by the trade deadline and Ellsbury can stay healthy, I think they might be able to squeeze 1 top 10 prospect plus 1 top 20 prospect out of an organization that needs and upgrade at CF. Shane Victorino is a huge question mark for me. A 32 year old guy who has spent his entire career in the National League who has already shown signs of offensive slow down. Last year he hit 11 HR with a .255 AVG. I don’t see his skill set translating to the AL East. He signed a 3 year, $39MM deal this offseason. I have to believe that Ben Cherington and the Red Sox faithful will regret that contract sooner rather than later. The Red Sox have some major question marks with their pitching staff. Those questions have to start with Jon Lester. Can he return to the dominant lefty who won 15 or more games 4 straight years (2008-2011)? He went 9-14 with a 4.82 ERA and saw a sharp decrease in his K/9 (8.55 in 2011 and 7.28 in 2012) and an increase in his HR/9 (0.94 in 2011 and 1.10 in 2012). The home runs isn’t a crazy shift from 2011 to 2012, but if you go back and look at his numbers the previous 3 years (0.60, 0.89, 0.61) the change is pretty dramatic. From 2008-2010, Lester was worth over 5 wins above replacement to the Red Sox. In 2011 it was 3.7 and last year it was 3.3. He needs to elevate his game back up to the elite level if the Red Sox have any hope of being competitive in this division. It should help that John Farrell is now his manager. Farrell was the pitching coach when Lester broke into the big leagues and should provide some steady guidance for this staff. Another guy who blossomed under Farrell, but has since slid backward is Clay Bucholz. Look back to 2010 (17-7, 2.33 ERA) and Bucholz looked like he’d be a super solid #2 starter behind Lester. His 2011 season was cut short by a back injury. He’s battled little injuries for his entire career only eclipsing 100 IP twice in his career. Sandwiched in between Lester and Bucholz in the rotation will be right hander Ryan Dempster. Dempster is a steady, unspectacular pitcher who can give the Red Sox an innings eater who can miss bats (7.79 career K/9). The rest of the Red Sox rotation (Felix Dubront and John Lackey) don’t give me a whole lot hope for the Red Sox. This rotation could very easily fall apart and be the Achilles heel for this team. Their bullpen however will prove to be a strength. The aforementioned Joel Hanrahan will handle the closing duties and the Red Sox will rely on Andrew Bailey, Koji Uehara, Daniel Bard and Alfredo Aceves to get the game to Hanrahan. Aceves, Uehara and Bailey all logged saves last year so the Red Sox have a deep and strong bullpen that can pick up some of the slack if when the rotation falls apart. Aceves will also be stretched out this spring to provide depth to the starting rotation. Fantasy Outlook The dependability questions about the starting pitchers tells me to stay away from any of the guys in the starting rotation. If I had to take a Boston starter, I’d probably take Dempster just because he’s low risk with a good chance of delivering his draft day value back to you. Out of the pen I like Koji Uehara because of his great WHIP (0.64), high K/9 rate (10.75) and his role. He’s not likely to see more than a couple of save opportunities, but he’ll almost always be the guy handing the ball to the closer. That has value. Jacoby Ellsbury is in his walk year and I think he’s going to out there to prove that 2011 wasn’t a fluke and that he is worth a gigantic contract next winter. I don’t think he’ll reach the epic 2011 numbers, but I do think he’ll stay healthy and provide quality numbers across your fantasy scoreboard. Dreaming on prospects never won anyone a fantasy title, but Red Sox Top prospect shortstop Xander Bogaerts is worth keeping your eyes on. Stephen Drew, while serviceable at short, is not any sort of long term solution. And Bogaerts has a prime time bat with enough glove to remain at shortstop. I’m not in love with the Red Sox. I think they have a lot of holes in their team. The starting rotation scares me, and not in a good way. Their lineup can do some damage, but only if they can stay off the trainer’s table. And I’m not convinced that they can. I think the dawn of a dark time in on the horizon for Red Sox Nation. Become a Member to have access to all VigilanteBaseball.com content.

His columns are humorous, thought-provoking, agenda-free, honest and unpredictable. E-mail him or follow his Twitter or become a fan of Jason Whitlock on Facebook. When it comes to Ray Lewis and the celebration/glorification of his illustrious, 17-season NFL career, the cliché “what’s done is done” applies. As his career comes to a close, perhaps this weekend when the Ravens take on Peyton Manning and the Broncos, football fans should not be ashamed of loving Ray Lewis. He’s earned our admiration and respect. That is not written to exonerate Lewis in the 2000 double-murder trial that nearly cost him his freedom, nor is it written to minimize the seriousness of the tragedy. It’s written to convey none of us is Perry Mason, none of us know what happened before, during or after Lewis, his friends and the victims stepped inside the limousine on that night. We can speculate. We can piece together clues. We can read into the fact Lewis reached financial settlements with the families of the deceased. We can express and feel deep sympathy for the deceased and their families. But we cannot know. What’s done is done. Our criminal justice system reached a plea agreement with Lewis to testify against the men the courts believed were responsible for the killings, and the courts charged Lewis with obstruction of justice. There were no convictions at the trial. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. I’m not granting Lewis forgiveness based on legal technicalities. I’m giving it to him based on common sense, life experience, an understanding of our criminal justice system and, most important, based on the way Lewis has conducted himself since the trial. Many of you cannot see yourselves making the decisions Lewis did on that fateful night. Why was he out partying with two “thugs”? One of Lewis’ friends charged with murder was also friends with Derrick Thomas, the Chiefs Hall of Fame linebacker. The friend, Joseph Sweeting, came to Kansas City every year to kick it at Derrick’s summer golf weekend. He was a little dude everyone called “Big Oomph.” I partied with him, and I’m a non-violent square. Unlike many of my sportswriting peers who can’t imagine themselves being in the same position as Ray Lewis, I can. When I was in college, a teammate and I stepped out of a car and some townies stopped their car and dropped several racial slurs on us, including the N-word. We were big, swollen, 21-year-old football players. We shouted for the townies to get out of their cars and fight. My teammate, unbeknownst to me, popped the trunk of his car and pulled out a semi-automatic weapon. Holy s**t! A simple fight just escalated into a war. My teammate was from a major city. As an 18-year-old, he’d been robbed and shot. He believed guns enhanced his safety. Lucky for me, the townies quickly drove off. I ran home. Had shots been fired, it’s likely I would’ve been viewed as an accessory to murder or attempted murder. I’m not a murderer. I’m an overeater. I’m a sportswriter. I’m a lap-dance lover, a craps shooter and an inappropriate joke teller. Again, I don’t know what happened with Lewis, his friends and the victims. But I’ve been young and dumb and friends with people in a different situation and a different mindset than me. The Lewis story is quite complex. The self-righteous people who know exactly what Lewis should’ve done on that night and the days and nights that followed sound naive and uninformed. That is not written to excuse. Lewis may have escaped incarceration, but, to me, it is clear he has not escaped the consequences. If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: Lewis’ pain is evident. I’ve written previously that the people who play football’s most violent positions — defensive front seven and safeties, offensive line and running backs — are fueled by inner pain. You can’t summon the emotion to play middle linebacker with the passion Lewis exudes without a deep, deep well of pain to fuel it. Lewis has played the most violent position in sports at an incredible level for 17 years. The only other guy to do it for that long at that high of a level was Junior Seau. I think we know now that Junior was in a lot of pain. Lewis’ critics watch him play, watch him dance, watch him collect millions of dollars and conclude he’s a lucky man who got away with murder. I see a man who got away with nothing. I see a man fighting his demons, working through his emotional pain. I see a man who was humbled by and is tormented by an unspeakable tragedy, who is doing all he can to make sure his teammates, coaches, peers and others do not know his pain. I don’t judge Ray Lewis by the double-murder trial. The truth of that situation is cloudy. I judge Lewis by the way he has handled the aftermath. His pregame dance, his preachy leadership, his charitable work and his spirituality all ring authentic to my ears and eyes. I love him because he plays football like a man who has been to hell and back and has no intention of returning. I will not apologize for loving Ray Lewis.",Raw Data
633,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Fresh off a 28-13 victory over New England in the AFC Championship game, the Baltimore Ravens stuck around to celebrate. Exuberant inside linebacker Ray Lewis jumped into the arms of fullback Vonta Leach. Running back Ray Rice and wide receiver Torrey Smith did the Lambeau Leap into a crowd of several hundred Ravens fans who were howling the beat from ""Seven Nation Army,"" which has become the team’s unofficial rallying cry. Players hugged each other and ran around the field like school children holding pre-printed posters celebrating the victory. And to think, five years ago, head coach John Harbaugh had to keep Ravens players from going at each other’s throats. The squad that Harbaugh inherited from predecessor Brian Billick had a major divide. A dominating defense had grown resentful of an offense that wasn’t carrying its end of the bargain. This animosity manifested itself during a wild brawl that broke out between both sides in an offseason practice. Hoping to promote camaraderie with a mantra stressed throughout the season, Harbaugh introduced a Biblical parable from the Old Testament that involved climbing a wall. Harbaugh stressed to his charges that they had to help each other or the team wouldn’t be whole on the other side. On Sunday, the Ravens didn’t just hurdle the one obstacle that they were unable to overcome. They broke through the wall that had kept the Ravens from reaching a Super Bowl during the previous four seasons of playoff appearances. That included last January’s heartbreaking 23-20 AFC title loss at New England. “We’ve been through a lot,” Ravens center Matt Birk said. “We’ve been close for the last few years. To finally get over the hump, it’s a tribute to how guys feel about each other in this locker room and how much they care.” The Ravens needed those bonds to keep from splintering during a tumultuous 2012 season. Key players battled injuries throughout the season. Offensive coordinator Cam Cameron was fired in mid-December when the unit had sputtered for too long. Yahoo! Sports reported that Ravens players almost had a mutiny in October because of what they thought was heavy-handed treatment by Harbaugh. While that rift was mended, Baltimore lost four of its final five regular-season games to stagger into the playoffs as a No. 4 seed. “We always knew our potential,” Ravens linebacker and special-teams ace Brendon Ayanbadejo said. “We hadn’t really played to our potential. We played in spurts. We haven’t been at full strength all year. We’re as close as we’ve been now. “We just hung in there and stuck to it. We didn’t panic. We were 9-2 to start the season. We dropped a few games, but we just wanted to make the playoffs. We’re built for January.” This was proven with three straight postseason victories, including two on the road as heavy underdogs against top AFC seed Denver and then the Patriots. The one against New England was especially satisfying because of the rivalry that has developed between two of the conference’s most successful franchises. Ravens outside linebacker Terrell Suggs celebrated New England’s demise en route to the postgame locker room celebration. He yelled at reporters to tell the Patriots “have fun at the Pro Bowl” next weekend in Hawaii and then added, “Arrogant f******.” “When you’ve got three titles and five (Super Bowl) appearances and (Tom Brady) under center, they’ve got the right to be,” Suggs added later. “We respect them. Even enemies can show respect.” The Ravens earned their own respect Sunday by overcoming a 13-7 halftime deficit. Baltimore’s defense pitched a second-half shutout against New England’s rapid-fire attack while the offense successfully exploited a Patriots secondary that couldn’t compensate for the absence of cornerback Aqib Talib, who didn’t return after suffering a thigh injury on the game’s first series. Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, who forecast a Ravens victory earlier in the week, caught two of Joe Flacco’s three second-half touchdown passes. “We’ve found a lot of different ways to win games this year,” said Birk, whose unit did an outstanding job neutralizing New England’s defensive front. “We won 9-6 (against Kansas City). We won 31-30 (against New England in September). We just always believed in each other that we could find a way.” There is further bonding among a slew of Ravens — coaches, players and front-office employees — who share a strong Christian faith. Players offered postgame praise during locker-room chatter among themselves. As he headed toward the locker room, Ravens backup guard Bobbie Williams shouted, “Nobody against us shall prosper! God is good!” Lewis is at the forefront of the movement. The Ravens have rallied around him since their football and spiritual leader announced at the start of the playoffs that he plans to retire at season’s end. Tears streamed down Lewis’ face during the national anthem as he said aloud, “Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord.” “God doesn’t make mistakes,” Lewis said after registering a team-high 14 tackles. “There was no way He was going to bring us back here twice to feel the same feeling. He had a real plan for us the whole year. “That’s one thing I really congratulate my team by. We stuck to the course no matter what happened throughout the year. It was always, ‘Next man up.’ It’s contagious in our locker room with a respect we have for each other, coaches, all the way down to trainers. It’s a great environment to be around.” Ayanbadejo is an exception on a roster with so many devout and outspoken Christians. His support of gay marriage rights continues to trigger extensive locker-room debate. But just because Ayanbadejo has a different belief system doesn’t mean he feels any less affection or appreciation toward his teammates. “Football is a fierce, physical, brutal game,” said Ayanbadejo, who joined the Ravens the same season as Harbaugh in 2008. “But if you don’t love the man next to you, you’re not going to play as hard as you can play. If you play with passion for each other, nobody can stop you. It’s an amazing story.” The final chapter hasn’t been written yet either. That comes Feb. 3 in Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers in New Orleans.",Raw Data
634,"Griffin had 23 points and nine assists, helping the Clippers beat the Portland Trail Blazers 96-83 on Sunday night and get even for a one-point loss to the Trail Blazers a day earlier. ''It's everybody's job on this team to step up, and that's what I've tried to do,'' Griffin said. ''Chris is a huge part of our team and he directs the game from the point guard spot. He has the ball in his hands during 85 percent of our offense. So when he goes out, our whole dynamic changes. But other guys have stepped up. Eric Bledsoe's done a great job.'' Bledsoe had 10 points, five assists and five rebounds in his seventh start, while Chris Paul missed his fourth straight game and seventh in the past nine because of a bruised right kneecap. Bledsoe played 36 minutes without committing a turnover. ''I just played more aggressive and didn't worry about it,'' Bledsoe said. ''My last couple of games I was playing kind of passive, but tonight I did a good job of just staying aggressive. My teammates just told me to just stay in attack mode, and everybody else on the team played great. At the end of the day, turnovers are going to happen. You can't play every game without having a turnover.'' Griffin powered the Clippers to a 55-50 halftime lead with 15 points, including a fast break dunk off a long pass from DeAndre Jordan just before intermission. Griffin also had an assist on six of the team's first nine baskets, including Jordan's alley-oop dunk and 3-pointers by Caron Butler and Matt Barnes. ''Our lead assist guy is not around, so we have to run some more things through Blake at the elbow and let him make plays for us,'' coach Vinny Del Negro said. ''He draws so much attention, but he's unselfish and he's making the good basketball plays and making other players better. That's what All-Stars do in this league.'' Griffin didn't get his first rebound in this game until after his sixth assist. ''Blake sharing the basketball made the game easier for everybody,'' Del Negro said. ''He was kind of like a `point forward' for us tonight. We had 33 assists and shot the ball well, which we haven't been doing. We were unselfish in a lot of areas.'' Franchise success or failure often can be traced to the top. We rank the five best and five worst NBA owners. The Clippers have the third-best record in the NBA at 33-13 and are 2 1/2 games behind San Antonio in the Western Conference. Lamar Odom had eight points, 13 rebounds and six assists. ''We needed any kind of a win right now,'' Del Negro said. ''We're trying to accumulate as many as we can, and then we'll count them up at the end of the year and see where we're at. ''We obviously executed a little bit better and got solid production from several guys. I liked our intensity in the second half, and we did a better job guarding the 3-pointers. But more so, our activity defensively was the difference in the game.'' LaMarcus Aldridge led the Trail Blazers with 21 points and 11 rebounds. It was Portland's seventh loss in nine games. ''It's hard to beat the same team two times in a row, especially on back-to-back said,'' rookie Damian Lillard said. ''They're a really good team. Last night I think we did a lot better job controlling their transition and not giving up as many easy plays.'' Portland never led in the second half on Sunday, falling behind 74-59 after a driving layup by Bledsoe with 3:15 left in the third quarter. Griffin didn't play after going to the bench with 10 seconds left in the third quarter and the Clippers leading 78-62. But they built the margin to as many as 19 points on a layup by reserve forward Ronny Turiaf with 6:23 remaining. ''We didn't take care of the ball and we had turnovers in the second half,'' Aldridge said. ''I thought they had some easy breakouts that opened the game up. Griffin did a good job of finding guys and making good reads. But we didn't play as well as we did last night, and some of the guys were a little tired.'' NOTES: The Blazers finished with 28 assists on their 29 field goals. ... Los Angeles outscored Portland 56-24 in the paint. ... The Clippers head out on a seven-game road trip. ... The Clippers shot 51.2 percent, and are 14-1 when shooting at least 50 percent. ... Los Angeles was leading 46-40 when Butler's fadeaway 3-pointer from in front of the Clippers' bench was disallowed because of an offensive foul called against him with 4:31 remaining in the second quarter. Butler picked up his third foul just 14 seconds later, but remained in the game until he was removed by Del Negro with 3:16 left in the half.",Raw Data
635,"That gold in the final individual event, combined with a pair of bronze medals Saturday, helped her become the first American woman to win the World Sprint Championships since Jennifer Rodriguez in 2005. ''Yesterday was so tense,'' an elated Richardson said Sunday. ''I just took all that pressure off me and said skate and have fun today.'' The overall title was the biggest victory of her career. While 23-year-old Richardson was all smiles afterward, Michel Mulder of the Netherlands was a jumble of emotions after he claimed second place in the men's 1,000 meters on Sunday to win the men's overall title, just 4 1/2 months after he captured the world title for inline skating. He triumphantly raised both arms, hugged teammates and coaches during a victory lap and shed some tears of joy. ''It's one of the hardest competitions mentally and I made it through it, '' said Mulder, who edged Finland's Pekka Koskela and Dutch teammate Hein Otterspeeer for the overall title with 136.790 points. But he acknowledged long-track skating on ice is more popular ''so the pressure was a bit higher,'' especially considering this was his debut at the World Sprint Championships. ''I had two ways to go, enjoy the first time being in the championship but also I knew I was in good shape and really wanted to go for a podium,'' Mulder said. He was in first place after the first day and made sure he stayed there. Sunday's win didn't change his plans. He'll work to defend his inline skating title next year then prepare for the Olympic season, and try to get through trials against a strong Dutch team. Sunday was time to celebrate. American Brittany Bowe, another former inline skater, also was celebrating a breakout weekend. But she had to deal with ''what if'' after her final 1,000. She finished fifth Sunday in 1 minute, 13.83 seconds, but lost valuable time during a crossover when Czech skater Karolina Erbanova impeded her. Erbanova was disqualified. ''My first lap felt really good,'' Bowe said. ''That was the fastest lap I had in competition thus far and going in the outer lane I was still picking up speed and carrying my speed really well.'' But Bowe would have to ease up, stand up and practically push off Erbanova to get through the lane change. She figures it cost her one-half of a second. ''That's racing,'' Bowe said. ''It's better now than at World Championships, single distances or the Olympics.'' Plus, she was happy to celebrate with Richardson, her training partner and friend. ''Hopefully we can keep pushing each other and be 1-2 in Sochi,'' Bowe said about the 1,000. Canada's Christine Nesbitt, the reigning Olympic champion and world-record holder, may have something to say about that. She easily won Saturday's race. On Sunday, she was second to Richardson, who finished in 1:13.19. Nesbitt clocked 1:13.28 and China's Hong Zhang was third in 1:13.64. American long-track coach Ryan Shimabukuro knew Richardson had it in her. ''Even though she's deserving of the title, she's got to go get it,'' he said. ''I'm glad that she really attacked it and was aggressive today.'' Richardson won the overall title with 148.015 points. Defending champion Jing Yu of China was second overall with 148.280 points, and South Korea's Lee Sang-hwa third at 148.560. ''I can breathe now,'' Shimabukuro said. ''Last time I was this nervous was the second 500 for the men in Torino, with Joey (Cheek) having a gold medal on the line. I'm happy it all worked out and that she was able to skate the races like I knew she could.'' ''She had so much pressure on her this weekend, maybe her nerves did get to her a little yesterday,'' Bowe said. ''All the media, the fans, everything she was expected to do. But she came back and did unbelievable and put down some really great times. It was a heck of a performance.'' Earlier Sunday, Lee set a track record in winning the 500. Lee, who set a world record last weekend at the World Cup in Calgary, finished in 36.99 seconds to edge Dutch skater Thijsje Oenema. Oenema set a Dutch national record by skating a 37.06. The old record for the Utah Olympic Oval was 37.00, set in 2007 by Germany's Jenny Wolf. Japan's Joji Kato won his second 500 of the competition Sunday, finishing in 34.29 to edge Canadians Jamie Gregg (34.50) and Gilmore Junio (34.53).",Raw Data

It’s been at least a month since you’ve mentioned The Wire in one of your columns. Are you mad at me? 10. There has to be a better solution than sitting Ed Reed for an entire game and stealing $400,000 from him because he executed a textbook hit on a receiver. Roger Goodell can call it a helmet-to-helmet hit. I live in football reality. Reed’s de-cleater on Emmanuel Sanders Sunday night was textbook. It was good football. It’s the way football has been played ever since they invented space helmets for football. I’m not anti-player safety. I get the concussion hysteria. I support efforts to make the game safer. There just has to be a better solution than suspending Reed for a game and taking his paycheck. Ed Reed is a signature NFL player. He’s a Hall of Famer. He’s a superstar. I love to watch him play. He should not be demonized because he’s struggling while trying to stop playing safety the way the position has been played for 40 years. (Editor's note: On Tuesday, the NFL agreed, reducing Reed's punishment to a $50,000 fine without suspension). Why not this? Hockey has a penalty box. Why can’t the NFL? You get flagged for a helmet-to-helmet hit — and if replay confirms it was a helmet-to-helmet hit — you must sit out the next 15 minutes (one quarter) of game action. If it happens in the fourth quarter, the time carries over into the next game. If you get flagged twice in the same game, you sit out 30 minutes (two quarters). If you get four helmet-to-helmet hits in the same season, then you get suspended for a game. To arbitrarily suspend Reed for a game and tie the suspension to a hit that took place in 2010 is absolutely ridiculous and it’s why Roger Goodell is seen as clueless by people who actually played football. 9. There’s no more mystery regarding what Jim Harbaugh really thinks about Alex Smith. All it took was a single terrific performance by second-year QB Colin Kaepernick against an overrated Bears defense for Harbaugh to “Belichick” San Fran’s starting QB.

Harbaugh sees his version of Tom Brady when he looks into the mobile, big-arm eyes of Colin Kaepernick. Bill Belichick benched Drew Bledsoe, a QB with a $100 million contract in 2001, in favor of the “hot hand,” Tom Brady. The difference is Belichick had nine weeks of information on Brady. Mo Lewis’ sideline hit on Bledsoe knocked the QB out for two months.",Raw Data
637,"FOX race analyst Larry McReynolds has more than 30 years of NASCAR experience as a mechanic, Daytona 500-winning crew chief and broadcaster. He earned 23 Cup wins as a crew chief, including two victories in the prestigious Daytona 500, as well as a pair of non-points victories in the annual all-star race. We’re right at 55 days until the first points race of the 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup season. I know we call this the offseason, but it’s not going to be much of an offseason for anybody. Not for drivers, for teams, for anybody because there’s obviously a lot of work to do with this new car. There’s a shortage of parts so there’s going to be a lot of scrambling. I’d say you’re going to see lights on at the shop for a big part of the holidays. I’d say except for a couple of three days around Christmas and New Year's, the lights are burning bright and long in some of these race shops. I think Brad Keselowski is going to be a great champion for our sport. He’s going to be a different champion. He’s very outspoken, very outgoing. He’s the guy you visualize sitting and having a beer with. He’s just that type of a guy. I’d like to think it will be him and Clint Bowyer and Jimmie Johnson again battling for the title in 2013, but I promise you it's hard to tell who we will be talking about as the 2013 Sprint Cup champion a year from now. Maybe it’s Jeff Gordon, maybe it’s Tony Stewart, maybe it’s somebody that didn’t even make the Chase for the Sprint Cup this year like Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch. That’s the great thing about this sport. It’s as unpredictable a form of motorsports or form of sports, period, as anything out there just because of all the layers and all the parts and pieces that are involved. Brad Keselowski won the title — but how did the rest of the Chase field end up? NASCAR Standings You know, the storylines around Keselowski winning this championship are endless. Most notably, that team owner Roger Penske, after being around for close to 40-something years and full-time in NASCAR for well over 20 years, finally got to sit at that head table. Then to have a 28-year-old champion - Keselowski is a blue-collar racer. He’s that guy that I think every Saturday night short-track racer can look at and go, “You know, if I take the right path, I can win a Sprint Cup Series championship.” If you think about five or six years ago, Brad Keselowski probably wasn’t even sure how he was going to pay his bills. And now, he's officially the champion. And then there is Dodge. What a going-away present for the manufacturer. Roger Penske says it best: Yes our sport is about horsepower, it’s about aerodynamics, it’s about a driver’s ability, it’s about all those things but at the end of the day – no different than any stick-and-ball sport that exists – it’s about people. That’s something that they did a good job with this year over there at Penske Racing this year to win this championship. Now, though, it's time to focus on 2013.",Raw Data
638,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah general manager Dennis Lindsey said the Jazz had plenty of opportunities to make a deal before Thursday's trading deadline. ""We just said, `No,""' Lindsey said. His comments came a few hours after the deadline passed without the Jazz dealing either power forward Paul Millsap or center Al Jefferson, leaving intact a team that is seven games above .500 entering the stretch run toward the playoffs. Lindsey said when any offer was added up, ""It wasn't any better than what we had"" as the team looked with an eye toward the future. Lindsey called the Jazz ""playoff competitive"" just not ""championship caliber."" Yet. Millsap and Jefferson had been considered trade bait because of their expiring contracts. The team has five other players with expiring contracts, plus estranged shooting guard Raja Bell, who has not been with the squad all season after battling last year with head coach Tyrone Corbin. The 6-foot-8 Millsap was considered the most expendable, not because he wasn't producing but because third-year pro Derrick Favors is waiting in the wings. Millsap has started all 55 games for the Jazz this season, averaging 15 points and 7.4 rebounds. Favors, 21, is averaging 9.4 points and 6.2 rebounds and is the team's top shot-blocker with 70. Lindsey cited a quote by another Jazz exec, Kevin O'Connor. ""When they say you should make a trade is probably when you shouldn't,"" Lindsey said. ""We're not here to win a press conference."" And he didn't want to do a deal just to say he did a deal in his first season as Jazz GM. ""We decided the incumbent position was the strongest now and going forward,"" Lindsey said. ""We'll see if we're right or wrong."" The Jazz certainly had options Thursday, and will have even more this summer though they risk losing both Millsap and Jefferson. Jefferson's contract this season pays him $15 million, and he is considered one of the elite big men in the league. How much more could he earn on the open market? A bigger question for the Jazz is whether his backup, 20-year-old Enes Kanter, is ready to fill his shoes. Jefferson, 28, leads the Jazz in scoring (17.7 points) and rebounding (9.4). Kanter is averaging 6.3 points and 4.1 rebounds in 14 minutes. Lindsey said the team didn't really have that many ""tough"" trade decisions. This summer may be a different story. Utah has only $25 million committed toward salaries next season. That includes a team option on seldom-used rookie Kevin Murphy and a $7.5 million player option for small forward Marvin Williams. Point guard Mo Williams, out since late December with a thumb injury, can take a deep breath for now. But he also is a free agent after the season. Corbin said earlier this week that he loves every player with the team, calling them ""Utah Jazz kind of players."" Utah has won three straight and 12 of its last 17 to pull within percentage points of sixth place in the Western Conference playoff race behind Golden State. The Jazz held it together despite being without Mo Williams for nearly two months. Playmaker Gordon Hayward only returned Tuesday after missing 10 games with a sprained right shoulder. Guard Randy Foye, who has helped Utah with his 3-point shooting, said the team believes it can reach the No. 4 spot in the West and gain home-court advantage in the playoffs. Lindsey can only hope. ""We have a strong group, with chemistry that's getting stronger,"" Lindsey said. ""We've got to take it to another level competitively.""",Raw Data
639,"Bill Reiter reported on LeBron James' first season with the Miami Heat and last season's Linsanity and has covered the NBA Finals, Super Bowl, Olympics and NCAA Tournament for FoxSports.com. He also can be heard regularly on Fox Sports Radio. Previously, he was an award-winning sports enterprise writer for the Kansas City Star. He lives in Kansas City with his wife and two children. Follow him on Twitter or like him on Facebook. Watch closely Thursday. Watch LeBron James continue to carry his team on the road, where they have struggled but he has been magnificent, game after game, day after day, his greatness still somehow expanding and crystallizing before us. Watch Kobe Bryant, too, as he tries to carry his floundering Lakers’ squad by willing them and himself to places he can still go but now they cannot. Watch, because it is the closest we are likely to get to what should have been. Remember Bird-Magic? Remember Wilt-Russell? Remember the idea of the two players most dominating their era facing one another in the playoffs – in the Finals – and infusing the game itself with some of their transcendent power? There was a time when it was like gravity, the knowledge they would find one another. It was magnetic. It was destiny. The greatest found ways to face each other on the biggest stage, and then, and only then, did their greatness come into such sharp relief that it changed the game, and them, and us, too. That will not happen. Not in this decade. Not in this era. Not, at least, for Kobe and LeBron. There will be no Finals meeting, no playoff faceoff, no coming-together under the klieg lights of postseason basketball under which basketball itself shines brighter because those two stars so often orbited by everyone else come suddenly into contact on the court. We have been robbed of that, somehow. We will not have our own Magic-Bird even if we have been given players of that magnitude at the same time who have each been championship-caliber. Kobe Bryant and his 30,619 points? They will almost certainly not face LeBron James and a level of play that has earned LeBron three MVP awards. Not outside of regular-season games like Thursday night’s, when the Heat head to Staples Center to play a 17-21 Lakers team that is simply lost. The Lakers are too much of a mess, too much of an “old damn team,” to use Kobe’s words, so lowly they are more concerned now about making the playoffs than making the NBA Finals. The Heat, despite their recent struggles, are the clear favorites for another Finals berth, but the Western Conference is a mountain the Lakers almost surely can no longer climb. It is too steep and they are too feeble for the task. Too many teams rise above them. The Thunder, the Clippers, the Spurs, the Grizzlies, perhaps even the Warriors – all are obstacles the Lakers would be unlikely to best, if they even get the chance. No, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James will not have that moment in the Finals to face one another down and battle, head-to-head, will-to-will, for a title. Not this year and probably not ever, given the Lakers' age and issues. If this seems inconceivable, it’s because it kind of is. Either LeBron or Kobe has played in each of the past six NBA Finals. They are the best players of this decade, and until Kevin Durant emerged to edge out (maybe) Kobe they were the best two players in the league year after year. Both Kobe and LeBron will finish their careers as top 10 all-time players, all-time greats who shined at the same time, won and made NBA Finals at the same time, but somehow could not do so against the other. Will LeBron win another one of these? Here's our top 10 MVP candidates. Everyone expected this confrontation. Nike did a series of Kobe-LeBron trash-talking puppet commercials in 2009. Talking heads spoke of the eventuality with reverential certainty. I moved from Kansas City to Miami two years ago to cover Miami's new super team, and my FOXSports.com colleague encamped with the Lakers that same season, because we were so sure those teams were on a collision course for one another. But no. LeBron could not get past a young Dwight Howard in 2009 or the old Celtics in 2010, and when, finally, his version of the Big Three trumped the Celtics and all other Eastern Conference comers in 2011 the Lakers could not withstand the Dallas Mavericks. Same thing last year when LeBron won his first title and Kobe couldn't keep up with the young Thunder. So watch tonight and see what might have been. Watch LeBron James in perhaps the greatest season he has ever had trying single-handedly to sober up a Heat team reeling, still, from a severe championship hangover. Watch Kobe try to place on his shoulders a group of guys who are not right together by shooting shot after shot, racking up point after point, doing all he can to squeeze from his aging greatness and unrivaled passion a team that is worthy of his talents and his desire. Bird, Jordan and Magic are among our top 10 players in NBA history. Watch a natural-born killer (Kobe) and a prodigy still finding his assassin’s edge (LeBron) stalk one another, play after play, two giants of the game so large that on the same stage in the same space they somehow make everyone else bigger, too. Watch and try to enjoy it even if it is a January game, not the June version we deserve. Does it matter that LeBron is 11-6 against Kobe Bryant in regular-season games and that he has won 10 of the past 13? Or that he has outscored him in 10 of those 17 matchups? It does. It does because it’s the closest we’ll get to seeing the two greatest players of their era play one another in a way that counts. LeBron is fighting to get his team right on the road, Kobe to get his team right at all. They will both be playing for something beyond their own stats or egos. They will not look past the other, January or otherwise. So watch tonight and see what will not be, and what should have been, and enjoy it. Enjoy two greats of the game whose time together on the NBA stage is drawing to an end, without the final scene we have all waited for, leaving us now with the near-certainty we’ll never see Kobe-vs.-LeBron outside nights like tonight.

640,"This is Part I of a two-part story on Katie Douglas return from ankle surgery. Return to FeverBasketball.com for Part II later this week. The Indiana Fevers local Southsider has gone from hometown girl at Perry Meridian High School to a worldly, cultured jet-setter with homes in Indy, Florida and Greece the native home of her husband and his family. But while Katie Douglas has made overseas travel and overseas living a fabric of her being, she is enjoying Indianapolis this winter her first without playing overseas in more than a decade. Fever fans remember the excruciating left ankle injury she sustained during the opening quarter of Indianas conference finals game at Connecticut. Pursuing a rebound, she rolled her ankle off the side of Tan Whites foot, crumpling in pain to the Mohegan Sun Arena floor. Indiana was leading 12-4 when she left with 4:47 on the clock and, rather than fade in her absence, the Fever put its foot on the gas pedal and dispatched the Sun 87-71 to reach the WNBA Finals. For the Fever, an amazing week of WNBA Finals action catapulted the franchise to its first championship. But while Douglas was an active part of the celebration, her participation was bittersweet. The first significant injury of her 12-year All-Star career had her watching from the sidelines. Her only appearance in her fourth WNBA Finals appearance was a three-second cameo appearance in front of the home crowd after the championship was on ice. With that setting in mind, she spent time with FeverBasketball.com discussing the week of activity she still calls surreal. Here are her thoughts on these timely moments from that week. Injured on the floor at Connecticut Its bad. I know its bad. I feel its bad. Its excruciating. Lying in the training room at Connecticut, hoping to come back to the game I was thinking, I know this was bad, but I thought if I could get 5 minutes of composure just to settle it down (I might have a chance). I was talking to Todd (Champlin, Fever trainer) telling him, take off my shoe, tape it up. Tape it tight. I was screaming at him, I want to play, I want to play. Just take it up, please. I was crying. I was trying to insist and persist but he knew medically it wasnt possible. Being transported in an ambulance, knowing the injury was indeed worse than shed hoped I think I was just in shock. I could tell it was bad just by the look in the eyes of the doctors and trainers as they were trying to analyze it. What was really going through my mind was that my ankle was in so much pain, I needed something for it. It felt like my ankle was hammered. The guy in the ambulance was talking to me and Rick Fuson (PS&E chief operating officer, who rode in the ambulance) was giving me updates from the game, but all I could think about was my throbbing ankle and I needed something for the pain. Back in Indianapolis, watching her team play in Minneapolis It was extremely hard not to be able to fly and be on the bench with the team. But from a medical perspective and from the teams standpoint, my best interest if I ever wanted a chance to play in the Finals was to stay at home without flying and swelling. In Indianapolis, I was either at rehab or mostly on bed-rest. Staying in Indy was a hard thing to do, but in my best interest. It was thrilling to watch Game 1. It was a weird thing to watch my team play on TV and me not be there but it was an awesome game. We had a bunch of people over to support me who knew I was going through a tough time. I was just trying to do whatever I could at rehab. It was a tough injury and the thing that was not on my side was time. Greeting her team upon their return to Bankers Life Fieldhouse [My teammates] were awesome. I was constantly in touch with all my teammates while they were in Minnesota through text and phone calls. Just the simple hugs and embraces from them meant so much when I saw them. They were excited when they got back and it was great to be re-united with them. It felt like they were gone for weeks. I felt like at least I was able to be a veteran again, if only by voice. Watching the team from the bench in Game 3, with a 30-point lead The whole thing was surreal. The whole experience was surreal from the time I got hurt at Connecticut, actually. I couldnt believe I got hurt for what was my fourth Finals [appearance]. I was saying to myself, I cant believe that were winning by 30 against the defending champs. What is going on? This is crazy! Zellous was going off (31 points). I felt like we couldnt miss, it was like the basket was just huge. The crowd was electrifying. It was kind of a surreal moment to watch the team go up 2-1. Checking into the game with 3 seconds left in Game 4 Coach came down and said, Katie, go in. It was so loud, I said, what? Go check in, she said [in drawn-out syllables to mock Lin Dunns accent]. It was an unbelievable moment just to get up to the scorers table and hear the ovation from the crowd, to hear their love and support and appreciation. To actually get out there and be recognized was a very special moment. Celebrating and accepting the trophy after the championship was won Unbelievable. Ive been in the situation three times prior, being a part of the other team walking off to the locker room with an enormous amount of disappointment. To be celebrating, and celebrating on our home court, was overdue. Very overdue.",Raw Data

642,"Faldo said McIlroy made a ""dangerous move"" in changing his club manufacturer earlier this season while he believes 14-times major winner Woods can never return to golfing dominance without regaining a ""go-to shot"" to use in pressure situations. Northern Irishman McIlroy, who won his second major title by a record eight shots at the US PGA Championship in August, switched his club brand last month from Titleist to Nike in a lucrative deal reported to be worth as much as $250 million over 10 years. ""Rory went from rookie of the year to world number one with the same equipment and now he's changed absolutely everything which I know, from personal grief, is dangerous,"" six-times major champion Faldo told Reuters. ""Once I heard the news, I tweeted it was a dangerous move. It's risky because it's all about the feel and sound of the golf ball, it's the feel and sound of the putter face, it's the feel and sound and the torque of a driver."" Faldo, a three-times Open champion who now works as the lead golf analyst on television for CBS Sports and Golf Channel, said that even very similar brands of golf clubs would feel very different to a player who had switched manufacturers. ""Factually yes, you can get really, really close but feel-wise, sound-wise, no, not even close,"" the 53-year-old old added while shaking his head. ""You get a millisecond at impact and you've known exactly how that sounded and reacted before. ""People say, 'Oh, Rory can adapt,' but why should he be adapting at this time in his career? He might just waltz through and it's all fine. Or you may even say, 'Hey, whatever his goals were before, he may have made them a little more difficult.' ""Feel is confidence in this game. That's your feedback and that's your trust. As Rory found out pretty quickly, he announces there are 14 new clubs in his bag and after one round of golf the putter's out, because it's different."" McIlroy made an inauspicious start in his first event with Nike equipment, missing the cut at the European Tour's Abu Dhabi Championship last month when he ditched his new putter after struggling with it in the opening round. The world number one has since taken a four-week break from competitive golf and returns to action in Wednesday's opening round of the WGC-Accenture World Match Championship at Dove Mountain where Woods, a three-times winner, is also competing. Faldo, who was renowned for his work ethic and shrewd course management during his prime, pinpointed self-confidence as perhaps the crucial component in a champion golfer's make-up. ""You've got to have real self-belief,"" said the Englishman who was arguably one of the most driven players ever in his quest to reach the very top of the game. ""Whatever shot you're trying to pull off, you've got to have the belief it's going to work. And if it doesn't ... it'll start sewing those little seeds of doubt in your mind and those seeds grow and they can end up as oak trees in your head."" Woods used to intimidate his rivals with his dominant golf and immense self-belief but all that changed for Faldo after the American's spectacular fall from grace at the end of 2009 amid revelations about his extra-marital affairs. ""It's more than three years since the crash-and-burn in his personal life and I personally think he has a lot to deal with there, right from when it all happened,"" Faldo said. ""In golf, you have to be completely engrossed and free just to go out and practise 100 percent. There's nothing worse if you then get distracted for good reasons or bad reasons. ""If somebody is in your ear or you are worried about something ... it's much harder to have that peace of mind."" Woods clinched his 75th PGA Tour title by four shots in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines last month but he dropped four strokes in his last five holes in blustery conditions mainly due to wayward driving. ""When he's on (form), he's fabulous ... but there are certain shots on the golf course he's struggling with and he showed us at Torrey he's still struggling with them,"" said Faldo. ""I don't think he has yet what we call a 'go-to shot' and you've got to have that one when literally, if someone puts a gun to your head and says, 'Right, hit me a fade,' you can aim down the left edge of the fairway and it peals back. ""If he really sorts that out, he could be unbeatable but that (doubt) may be starting to engrain itself in him."" Woods has not won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines and his burning desire to eclipse the record 18 piled up by Jack Nicklaus, in Faldo's view, will never be fulfilled. ""You can't say it's impossible but I am leaning towards no,"" said Faldo, whose own work ethic came straight out of the Ben Hogan manual. ""I don't think it will happen. Getting five more (majors), that's more than a really, really fantastic career (for most players). ""It's a big climb after how he has shaken himself up mentally. The biggest thing is how Tiger must look at himself in the mirror and wonder what happened. It's a lot to deal with.""",Raw Data
643,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. “I always say, ‘Adversity introduces a man to himself,’ ” the star South Carolina running back said this week during a Senior Bowl visit. “That’s a quote that pops in my mind every time I’m going through a hard day or don’t feel like doing something. That keeps me going.” Yeah, the Harbaughs will be the media darlings. But don't sleep on these names come Super Bowl XLVII. Lattimore has plenty of other motivation as well. Not only is he trying to recover from a knee injury even more serious than one he suffered the previous season, Lattimore wants to convince an interested NFL suitor that he would be available to play at the start of the 2013 regular season. The earlier Lattimore gets drafted, the more guaranteed money in his rookie contract. To that end, Lattimore made an unscheduled visit earlier this week to Mobile (his early-entry junior status would have kept Lattimore from playing in the Senior Bowl anyway). He said his intent was “just letting teams see me walk around — I feel that’s big — and know I’m going to be fine and ready by Week 1.” “This process is just like an ACL (tear),” he continued. “I’m going to come back stronger than ever.” Lattimore had overcome a torn left anterior cruciate ligament suffered in 2011 when his standout junior campaign came to a crushing halt late October against Tennessee. At the time, he again was showing the same skills that helped him make a major splash onto the college landscape as a Gamecocks freshman in 2010. Hit by two Volunteer defenders, Lattimore suffered torn ligaments and a dislocated kneecap in his right leg. Lattimore said he went into such shock that, “I really thought I was dreaming.” The reality is that one of college football’s best players had his pro career placed in jeopardy. “Before he got hurt, he was one of the top backs in the country,” a general manager who was speaking on condition of anonymity told FOXSports.com. Lattimore believes he still should be worthy of the same consideration, especially considering his experience playing in South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier’s offense. “You have to be able to catch the ball, know how to run routes and pass protect,” said Lattimore, who finished his college career with 2,677 rushing yards and 38 touchdowns in a little over two-plus seasons combined. “The running takes care of itself. You’re a running back. That’s what you do. But pass protection is key. If you can’t do it, you’re not going to play and he’ll let you know that.” The first good news for a full recovery came when doctors discovered no nerve damage in Lattimore’s right leg. He received another boost when beginning to rehabilitate post-surgery at the Pensacola, Fla.-based center run by renowned orthopedist Dr. James Andrews. “The guys were so positive about everything that I was going through and my rehab,” Lattimore said. “It just got better day by day by day. “I came to a point about two weeks ago that, man, I’m going to make this easier than I did with my left knee. This is just like rehabbing an ACL. I am going to come back stronger and have a great career.” Lattimore’s agents (Sports Trust Advisors) recently sent all NFL teams a video of him running in a pool. He will begin jogging on a treadmill in less than two weeks. When early April comes around, Lattimore plans to conduct a limited workout to show his progress, a la Willis McGahee in January 2003. McGahee sustained a knee injury about as ugly as Lattimore’s during the University of Miami’s national championship game loss to Ohio State. McGahee wasn’t able to perform all the standard pre-draft drills but he was impressive enough to get chosen by Buffalo with the No. 23 overall pick. Now with Denver, McGahee has rushed for 8,097 yards and 63 touchdowns over the past nine seasons. The Bills didn’t want to take any extra chances for a setback with McGahee, so he didn’t play as a rookie. As much as Lattimore wants to get back on the field in 2013, the aforementioned general manager didn’t think that would be happening. “If we took him, I doubt we’d play him,” the GM said. “He’s a guy who needs to sit a year and get past that. “I think the big thing about him is that he’s a winner. He does whatever it takes. A lot of (running backs) have the ability he’s got. But he reminds me of guys like Thurman Thomas who refuse to get beat or tackled. I think somebody that takes a chance on him will get a steal.” That franchise also will be getting a player who enters the draft humbled and appreciative following a stretch that would have broken lesser-willed athletes. “Everything happens for a reason. This reason was it made me mentally tougher,” Lattimore said. “It put things in perspective where I’ll never take anything — walking, running — for granted again. “I know what it’s like to not walk and run.”",Raw Data

645,"Five years ago, Steven Holcomb was the top-ranked bobsled driver in the United States. He was arguably the very best in the world. Holcomb was winning just about every race his two- and four-men teams competed in, beating the Russians and the Germans, the longtime class of the sport. His gold-medal dreams were never more realistic; his skills never so sharp. But he had a secret that was burrowing inside of him. Steven Holcomb was going blind. Holcombs story, shared in his recently released memoir But Now I See is one of triumph and courage. But its also one of deep sorrow and grief. In the wake of the tragic Jovan Belcher murder-suicide in Kansas City, Mo., on Dec. 1, stories like Holcombs hopefully can inspire other athletes to do what the 2010 gold-medal winner did when he reached his lowest point speak up and seek professional help. While it may have appeared as though the world was in Steven Holcombs hands in 2007, his life was a spiraling mess. When we met recently in a midtown Manhattan restaurant, he arrived in sweats and a baseball hat with a small titanium case held firmly in his right hand. Whats in there? I asked the 32-year-old world champion. My gold medal. People always seem to ask me about it, so I just bring it with me. Everywhere? Pretty much, he nodded. Whats the point of it collecting dust in a basement? Holcomb holds tightly to his gold medal as he does everything else in his life these days. Hes both grateful and aware of how close he was to losing it all. At the peak of his athletic career, Holcombs vision was deteriorating at an alarmingly rapid pace. On the surface, everything seemed OK. He was placing first at events and he was smiling in photographs. The US bobsled team was as good as it'd been in years, and he was one of the main reasons why. Inside, however, he was losing his grip. For years, Holcombs vision had been getting steadily worse. Scared of what could happen if the USOC or his coaches deemed his vision too poor to get in the sled, he would shake and shuffle his way through annual physicals and eye exams. Before the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, he went to great measures to hide his secret. I felt like I had no choice, really,"" he told me over lunch. ""I memorized the lines of the eye chart you see in doctors offices. I had it down. F-E-L-O-P-D. D-E-F-P-O-T-C. If nobody knew I was going blind, and my performance wasnt taking a hit, I figured Id be OK. But I was cheating. Not the PED type of cheating, but cheating nonetheless. Everyone else viewed the eye test as a joke, but not me. I needed to pass. So I memorized the chart and kept on going with the charade. But as time progressed, things got worse. Bobsled is not a one-man sport. Its a team game,"" Holcomb said. ""And its dangerous. I was the driver, and I was going blind. Every time we raced, I had a best friend or three best friends lives in my hands. And I couldnt see a thing. Worse, I couldnt say a thing. That guilt, that secret it really weighed on me. A socially active guy who grew up skiing competitively with the likes of Lindsey Vonn and Julie Mancuso, he became reclusive in his mid-20s. In the sled, everything was normal. But once hed be outside, in the real world with teammates, he was forced to constantly find creative ways to cover up his deteriorating sight. His inability to see anything made being social difficult. His inability to say anything about it made life downright arduous. There were some very dark times. Times I dont like thinking about today, he said, with the gold medal resting on a bench between us. Holcomb had become so accustomed to the courses he was racing on that he was able to guide the bobsled by feel and by sound. If I had perfect vision, Im not sure I would have been performing as well as I was. I could only see the very small window in front of me. There was nothing to be scared or distracted by. I zeroed in. When a race started, I had no choice but to be in the zone. But the more he'd win, the more the guilt and the lies would eat away at him. What if his teammates knew he was guiding their sled and essentially, holding their lives in his hands without functioning eyes? What if, God forbid, his other senses failed him? It would have been a major tragedy, he said softly. A major tragedy that would have been entirely my fault. Hed been diagnosed with keratoconus, a rare eye disease that leads to the degeneration of the structure of the cornea, in 2000. But he always figured his eyesight eventually would improve. He thought itd get better or that hed be able to get around it. It never did. It got worse and worse. It got to the point where I couldnt deal with it anymore. At 27, with his bobsled career on a trajectory set for Olympic superstardom, he attended an event with sponsors in Colorado Springs. Id smiled and laughed and lied with effortless abandon, leading them on to believe that the money they were investing, and the time they were putting into me was worth it, he wrote in his memoir. My teammates were entrusting their lives to me and I was foolishly keeping a dangerous and devastating secret. One slip, one crash, one wrong move, and I would be responsible for injuring an athlete who had no clue about the conditions under which he would be competing. Holcomb left the event alone and slumped into the king-size bed in his hotel room when he got back. He was living a lie. He was depressed. He couldnt take it anymore. That night, he very nearly took his own life. The demons logic prevailed, he told me, now five years removed from the night hell never forget. With too many lies, too much at stake and nowhere to turn, Holcomb took 73 sleeping pills that night an entire bottle and chased them down with a large handle of Jack Daniels whiskey. No note was written. No last-second text message was sent. I thought I would sleep forever, he wrote in the book. The strains of a dual life had finally become too much to withstand. That night, Steven Holcomb was willing to give it all up. He never expected to wake up. And when he inexplicably did, he had an epiphany. I was depressed. I needed to speak to someone. I had to let it all out. The lies. The guilt. Everything. I couldn't do it anymore. Holcomb, fortunate to be alive, decided that it was time to seek professional help. He also woke up with the realization that it was time to tell his coach and his teammates about his deteriorating vision. In an emotional moment, he met with coach Brian Shimer and told him about his condition. At the end of the conversation, Holcomb retired from the sport. He didnt get mad, Holcomb recalled. Instead he was like, Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Lets see what we can do first. There has to be a treatment.' For nearly a decade, Holcombs vision had gotten steadily worse. Hed been to many doctors for checkups and had stayed up countless late nights researching on the web. Though his coach was optimistic, Holcomb was certain there was no treatment for keratoconus. Mere days after their sit-down and Holcomb's retirement, Shimer called with promising news. There was a doctor in California, Dr. Brian Boxer Wachler, who had recently started doing surgeries for the degenerative eye disease. The US Olympic Committee and the US Bobsled and Skeleton Federation ponied up the money I could have never afforded it, Holcomb said and he was sent to California for the procedure. Known in the clinical community as C3-R, it was a success. Though hed never have 20/20 vision again, Stevens deteriorating eyes would deteriorate no more. There was hope in my life, again, he said. After nearly ending it all, my secret was not only off of my chest, but my eyes were finally addressed, too. All that mystery, all that guilt it was suddenly gone. With his fears conquered and with clinical help guiding him through his ongoing bouts with mental illness, Holcomb got back in the sled. Three years later, he was the driver of the four-man US bobsled team that won gold in Vancouver. Now, at 32, he eyes another gold medal in 2014 as his next career goal. Its amazing now to think about how dark a place I was once in, Holcomb said, eyeing the case that contains his gold medal. Im good now. But I had to address what was making me so dark. I had to speak to someone. Not everyones able to come to that realization."" In the wake of the Belcher tragedy in Kansas City, its a conversation we all should be having. If theres something going on, its OK to seek out professional help. Its OK to talk. If my book can teach anything, its that if you are true to yourself and you seek help, theres usually something or somebody that can help. Holcomb said. ""That was the case with me. I want everyone to know about my story."" He took a sip from his drink and looked around the crowded restaurant. Hey, nobodys invincible. Minutes later, he walked away, his gold medal tightly clenched in his hand.",Raw Data
646,"Greg Monroe’s four straight double-doubles have the rest of the NBA sitting up and taking notice, but we’ve seen signs that this Pistons rookie had it in him now for a while. He didn’t play in his first two games, but I know the coaches and the front office always thought that he’d be a big part of the puzzle before this season got too far along and now he’s proving them right. The amazing thing about Greg Monroe is he’s such a good student. He’s so coachable. He’s like a kid in college taking a mid-term at this point. If you’re a parent, you’d hope he’d have a B by mid-term, but he’s at A-minus already. It’s fun to watch him learn how to do what he does best against the greatest athletes in the world. When I saw him in college, I saw him do some great things but he was – as you would expect – usually the tallest guys out there and didn’t have to be as creative as he’s had to be to make things happen at this level with the size and the agility and the athleticism we have in the NBA. You could see the intelligence was there, the skills were there and I love the fact that Joe D got him at pick seven. He may turn out to be – even though that’s a high lottery pick – even better than a No. 7 pick. Four straight double-doubles – and they’ve been strong ones. They haven’t been accidental double-doubles. He’s worked for every rebound. He’s getting better at the free-throw line, he’s terrific on run-outs and his feel for the game allows him to make great back-door cuts. When you’ve got people like Tracy McGrady finding you, it makes it look like those are easy points – but they aren’t easy. You have to make the cut at the right time and you’ve got to catch a bullet and get it up there before one of the NBA’s best comes to try to block the shot or knock it away from you before you can get it up. You are a bona fide NBA player if you get double-doubles with some regularity. And I’d say four in a row is better than some regularity. But let’s be conservative right now and say he’s a bona fide NBA player, yet the Pistons don’t run much for him, if anything, and he still hasn’t quite learned how to deal with the officiating. When he can stay out of foul trouble and the coaches run more plays for him – and that’ll happen, as their confidence in him continues to increase – I don’t think 15 to 18 points and 10 rebounds a night is out of the question. And who knows? The guy has been such a great student and he has the ability – maybe he’ll even get better than that. He’s one guy that I really look forward to following over the next few years. When I think about players I’ve seen in my 30-plus years as the voice of the Pistons who compare to Greg, I do see a little of the two names I’ve heard, Brad Miller and Arvydas Sabonis. Greg’s made some fine passes so far, but he’s got more than just a few assists per game in him. Once he’s established at the high post and plays are run to take advantage of his ability to see the court and deliver the ball, he could be an even tougher cover. He can not only get shots for himself and continue to rebound, but he’ll get easy shots for other people. Brad Miller is still playing in this league and making a nice paycheck umpteen years later. It’s not all because he rebounds and scores. At least a third of his value is his ability to pass the basketball as a big man. We have that to look forward to from Greg Monroe. We know he has that in him. We’ve even seen flashes of it at this level. On the other end, I see a battler defensively. He keeps his composure and really doesn’t give an inch. I think some of that comes from his Georgetown background and playing in a tough conference like the Big East, but some of that is just Greg Monroe. I see him as a guy who is even going to get better defensively. You have to play against these guys a few times to really understand what works against them. Sure, there are certain things fundamentally you have to do on the defensive end, but every guy is a different case study. This guy is a smart player. He’ll learn his lessons and he won’t forget them. When we’re only talking January of his rookie season and he’s able to make plays defensively and force turnovers that lead to fast-break hoops for his team, I look for a lot more of those in his future. Greg Monroe is going to be a fun player to watch develop over the rest of this season and beyond. The Pistons got a keeper in the 2010 draft in this guy.",Raw Data
647,"Kevin Harvick wants us to believe that he will be a championship contender in 2013. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. Harvick, who was offered the opportunity of a lifetime to drive the No. 29 by Richard Childress in 2001 after Dale Earnhardt was killed in the Daytona 500, wants us to believe there will be no animosity felt by his owner as he prepares to leave at the end of the year to drive for Tony Stewart. And Harvick wants us to believe that after discussing the situation with Matt Kenseth, who parted ways with Jack Roush after 13 seasons to join Joe Gibbs Racing, he has the perfect road map to circumvent the landmines along the way. But will it be that easy? For me, I look at this as a character-building year to go out and have fun and leave this place as good as it was when I got here if not better, Harvick said. You want to do everything you can to participate in everything you can to make the cars run as fast as you can. I have a lot of friends here and I want to leave that way. Thats how you have to approach it. As weve gone through testing and everything, everyone is talking and communicating and doing the things to make the cars fast and thats really what its all about winning races and being competitive. Yet after Harvick fired his team and crew chief Gil Martin at the end of 2011 when he finished third for a consecutive season, one has to wonder how loyal his team will be. Despite a shake-up on the No. 29 team, Harvick quickly learned the grass was not greener under the direction of Shane Wilson. Harvick begged Martin to return and he did apprehensively at Bristol in August. Eleven races later, Martin and Harvick returned to Victory Lane at Phoenix Raceway and finished eighth in the point standings. For Harvick, now 37 years old, it was the eighth time he finished in the top 10 since Childress promoted him to the Cup Series 12 seasons ago. Still, it wasnt enough. Its been a great journey, Harvick said. But sometimes you need a change of pace to keep the enthusiasm and things to where they need to be. Its made the enthusiasm level high for this year. I think Ive been here since October of 99. Weve won Nationwide championships, 19 Cup races, 30 or 40 Nationwide races, truck races and lived through a lot of different situations. Changes can be bad but for the most part when you have change the enthusiasm level goes through the roof and you want to do well. Sometimes you just need a change of pace and thats where I was. Harvick still hasnt acknowledged publicly that Stewart Haas Racing is his destination for 2014. When you ask Harvick for specifics on his defection, he remains coy. But Harvicks admission that these guys (RCR) are looking to build their company for the future so theres going to be some situations that obviously you dont think is right but theyre doing whats best for them to take them into the future. So youre going to have to suck it up in a few different situations to do the right thing for everybody, says a lot. One can surmise from that statement that Harvick questioned the rationality of Childress focus on grandsons Austin and Ty Dillons development over the Sprint Cup program. TRUE TEST NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers tried out the new-model car at Daytona. Take a look! While the Dillons are extremely talented and show tremendous promise, its a sentiment shared by many in the Welcome-based shop. As a former team owner and a successful one at that Harvick thoroughly understands the complexities involved with running an organization. And despite the tragedy Richard Childress Racing faced in 2001 with the loss of not only the face of the company but the sports compass in Dale Earnhardt, this organization persevered. Despite running one less race than the rest of the field, Harvick still finished ninth in the point standings. Harvick believes that if the organization survived the loss of Earnhardt, this transition will be easy. Everybody gets frustrated and obviously Richard has been through a lot of situations with me, Harvick said. You look back and still, this isnt even close to what we approached in 01. This isnt really that hard. When you can keep your company floating and keep winning races and keep people in jobs, when we look back at a lot of the closed door stuff and all the scenarios we had to go through in that particular instance and the emotions? This is a cake walk. When asked whether he has discussed his departure with Childress, Harvick insists they only discuss matters on the track and dont talk about feelings. For a relationship that spans 14 seasons, that seems a bit understated. Regardless, Childress has invested emotionally and financially in Harvick since discovering the Bakersfield, Calif. native in the truck series and drafted him for a Nationwide Series ride in 1999. A lot has transpired throughout the course of their relationship since then including Harvicks discussion of his departure with Childress before the story was leaked in November before the events at Phoenix. But Childress didnt expect the news to break before the end of the season. After 40 years in the business, Childress says he was surprised by the news but he still wants the driver to win the championship and leave on a high note. Hell do well at Stewart Haas and well keep moving forward and see how it turns out, Childress said. He and Tony have a good relationship. I knew he had been talking to other teams. When we lost Dale and put Kevin in the car, he was the driver we needed. Now that hell leave, we will find another driver to put in and carry RCR on. We have two good drivers with Paul Menard and Jeff Burton. Well add to that and one of them could be Austin. I really havent given it a lot of thought. CHECK IT OUT Chevrolet has officially unveiled its 2013 Sprint Cup model. Were so focused in putting everything together for next year and being competitive like we should be. 2012 was a disappointment but all teams go through it. If you look back through history whether it was Roush, Hendrick, whoever, you have your highs and lows. Last year was just another low. Over the last 12 seasons, Harvick has amassed 19 wins and no Cup championships. Yes, hes been close. In 2010, Harvick led the point standings for 20 of the first 26 races but not during the Chase. The following year, Harvick topped the points for four races and as late as Dover, the third race of the Chase, before Stewart waged his epic comeback by winning five races in the playoffs and SHRs first championship. Since SHRs inception four years ago, Stewarts company has earned a Cup title and 17 victories. RCR scored 12 wins during that period, but hasnt won a title since Earnhardts last championship run in 1994. Its understandable that at 37, Harvick wants one last run at the title and feels that Stewart can provide him with the equipment to succeed. For now, however, hell have to rely on his team until November. Everybody that Ive been talking to is expecting this big, wild blow up year, Martin said. Im telling you, its actually going to be a positive. That guy thrives on this kind of environment. To have that kind of motivation to show everybody that we can win this championship, I think hes going to thrive on it. I really do. I think the team is geared up for it. We have a lot to prove just not as a team but as a company. And I dont think its going to be a negative. Is it going to be disappointing when the year comes to an end and everyone splits ways? Yeah. But I hope we do it with a ring on our finger. At the end of his tenure, Harvick insists he wants to remain competitive throughout the season and leave with as much class as (he) can. Its really all what you make it, Harvick said. Weve obviously beat around the subject the last couple of weeks in different situations, but Ive been around my team a lot over the past several weeks and feel good about where everybodys mindset is. They dont care what anyone thinks upstairs. They just want to win races. Thats where Im at. Were going to race. Were all racers. We dont care whether were driving for whoever, or driving here, there or anywhere a go-kart race, whatever it might be. You just want to go out and win. Nobody is going to do anything less than go out and try to achieve those goals.",Raw Data

650,"Clippers head coach Vinny Del Negro has been a part of two of the three 16-0 months in NBA history. He just wrapped up a perfect December with the Clippers, but was a starter on the 1995-96 Spurs that went undefeated in March ’96. The two teams have a few notable similarities that go beyond merely Del Negro’s role in both. Of the three teams in NBA history to complete a 16-0 month, the Clippers head coach has been a part of two of them. He patrolled the sidelines this December as the Clippers (25-6) put together the most historic stretch in their four decades as a franchise. The 1971-72 Lakers were the first to go unblemished in a calendar month consisting of 16 games, doing so when the Clippers were known as the Buffalo Braves and had been added to the league a year earlier. The Clippers’ undefeated month comes nearly 17 years after the San Antonio Spurs amassed the second perfect month in league history, going 16-0 in March. Del Negro was a member of that team, too, averaging a career-high 14.5 points per game alongside fellow starters Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott, Dennis Rodman and David Robinson for a Spurs group that won 17 straight, just like the Clippers. “You know what I recall, I played with David Robinson and that took care of a lot of problems,” Del Negro said. “I was real fortunate to play with Dave for a long time. When we went on that streak we had a lot of quality players and a lot of NBA head coaches on that team and then David was the catalyst. I mean, obviously he was such a dominant player.” Two things emerge from Del Negro’s recollection of that season in San Antonio: First, the depth of NBA knowledge among the roster. There were four recent NBA head coaches on that roster (Del Negro, Johnson, Doc Rivers and Monty Williams), an assistant (Chuck Person) and a front office executive (Hornets general manager Dell Demps). Second, the driving force of the ’95-96 Spurs was a superstar. Perhaps, the Clippers are similar in their makeup. They have a wealth of players with high basketball IQs. In NBA.com’s preseason survey of General Managers, Chauncey Billups, Grant Hill and Chris Paul were named among the top five active players who would “make the best head coach someday.” Paul along with fellow star Blake Griffin doubles as the Robinson figure: the ones who take care of a lot of problems. Del Negro has talked about the role of stars at various times throughout his two seasons coaching Paul and Griffin. “That’s what superstars do,” Del Negro said in Utah on Dec. 3 when the Clippers stormed back from 10 down in the fourth quarter to win behind Griffin’s 30 points and Paul’s daring-do in the final minute. Del Negro’s not one likely to compare teams, seasons or situations. He often says “every team is different.” But prior to the Clippers’ 17th consecutive victory Sunday, he let on that he sees some similarities between the Spurs of yore and his current team, particularly when navigating such an unprecedented win streak. “It’s never easy to do,” Del Negro said. “I don’t care what level you’re at, it’s hard, especially here (at the NBA level). We had a special bunch of guys then and I feel we have a special bunch of guys in our locker room.” Paul alluded to the same thing Sunday. “We have the right personnel, the right people, stuff like that.” Caron Butler said a mix of veterans and youngsters helps the group hold one another accountable. “We do a good job of policing ourselves,” Butler said. “I think coach lets us control the environment. That’s a great coaching tactic that he [has], letting us feel each other out, control the environment and it’s been working.” As the Clippers arrive in Denver Monday evening, flush with Del Negro’s old Spurs team at 17 wins in a row, they look to avoid the same fate. The game immediately following their perfect month, San Antonio lost, 111-104, to the Suns on the road. “This is pro basketball,” Del Negro said. “There’s scheduling, injuries, you can play well and get beat, play poorly and win. You just have to kind of take them as they go. There’s never anything easy out there. We’ve proven that.” They’ve also proven capable of making history, and in Del Negro’s case, doing it twice.

651,"They responded to his energetic play with loud, boisterous support for the next two hours and he responded to their cheers by delivering a performance to remember. The junior guard finished with 21 points, seven rebounds, six steals and three blocks, leading the seventh-ranked Hoosiers to a 75-70 victory over No. 13 Michigan State on a day Oladipo was already thinking about doing more. ''There are still things I need to improve on, even today,'' Oladipo said. ''So I have to keep getting better.'' This one will be hard to top. Indiana (18-2, 6-1 Big Ten) has won three straight since a Jan. 25 loss to Wisconsin. It has won back-to-back games over the Spartans after ending a six-game losing streak in the series. The Hoosiers picked up their ninth win in Assembly Hall over a Top 25 foe during the past 24 months, and their latest victory helped break up a three-way logjam atop the Big Ten. Indiana was awaiting the result of the Michigan-Illinois game to see if it would share the conference lead with the Wolverines or have it all to themselves. How much did this win mean to coach Tom Crean? After shaking hands with his old friend, Tom Izzo, Crean walked to the corner in the south end of Assembly Hall, raised both arms and thanked the students for their constant noise. A few minutes later, he was thanking others. ''He (Oladipo) was a tremendous difference from the start of the game. He had a knowledge base that he put into his game as to how he was going to defend,'' Crean said. ''If you're not cerebral like that and at the same time, quick, it's hard to defend like that. But he's been good. We knew he was going to play well on the offensive end and to take away things on the defensive end, too. And we don't win this game without Will Sheehey, we really don't.'' The impact of Oladipo was evident in the box score and beyond. He was 8 of 12 from the field and 4 of 6 from the line with more offensive rebounds (four) than defensive. Crean also credited him with 15 first-half deflections, something Crean said he's never seen before. And when Oladipo wasn't making plays, there were plenty of others willing to help. Cody Zeller made only two baskets and finished with nine points but scored on a layup with 1:38 to go to make it a two-possession game. He also took a charge with 14.3 seconds left that essentially sealed the win. Christian Watford finished with 12 points and six rebounds, Yogi Ferrrell had 11 points and a key 3-pointer just before halftime and Jordan Hulls had 10 points and four assists. Most of it was the result of Oladipo and the threat he posed on every possession. ''That's just Victor,'' Watford explained. ''We feel like we're a great team when Victor does this. He brings a lot of energy. Not only that, he gets us open by the way he attacks the basket. He did a great job today.'' Michigan State (17-4, 6-2) just couldn't keep up. Gary Harris, last year's Indiana Mr. Basketball was booed relentlessly, yet made five 3-pointers and finished with 21 points. Adreian Payne added 18 points and was 3 of 4 from beyond the arc, matching his season total of three 3s. The only other player to reach double figures was Branden Dawson, another Indiana native, who has 12 points and eight rebounds. Still, it wasn't up to Izzo's standards. The Spartans, playing in special green-and-gold uniforms, committed 19 turnovers, allowed Indiana to shoot 50.9 percent from the field and essentially wound up with a rebounding draw, 32-31. Guard Keith Appling fouled out with 5:14 to go, too. ''Our whole deal was to keep them out of the lane and not turn the ball over and we didn't do either one of those very good,'' Izzo said. ''We got tired, and we've been so good down the stretch and with three minutes left, I thought we had a chance.'' It was every bit as entertaining as advertised. After Michigan State took a 31-30 lead late in the first half, Indiana answered with a 3 from Sheehey and another 3 from Hulls. Ferrell's 3 to close the half gave Indiana 44-38 lead. Whether it's the history of Allen Fieldhouse or the frenzy of Cameron Indoor, college basketball boasts many distinctive arenas. Did your team's home court make the list? Oladipo's two free throws with 16:28 to go extended the lead to 50-43, but when it looked like the Hoosiers might pull away, Harris dashed those hopes by making back-to-back 3s over the next 50 seconds to get the Spartans within 50-49. Indiana never led by more than six the rest of the way, but with Oladipo leading the defense, Michigan State never managed to tie the score or take the lead, either. The Hoosiers final sealed it in the final 98 seconds when Zeller made the layup and took the charge, and Hulls made 1 of 2 free throws. ''It was a physical game, a hard-nosed game, it was a high-level game and they're a great team,'' Crean said. ''That's why it's a great win for us.''",Raw Data
652,"QPR had a bid for the striker turned down earlier this month, though it was understood Odemwingie wanted the opportunity to discuss a move. The 31-year-old has now put in writing his wish to leave The Hawthorns two-and-a-half years after his arrival from Lokomotiv Moscow, but his request has been turned down by the Premier League club.

653,"Ross McCormack's goal five minutes into the second half sent Leeds into the last 16 and ensured Spurs befell the same fate as Norwich City and Queens Park Rangers, who were knocked out on Saturday. Luke Varney had given the Whites a first-half lead and, though Clint Dempsey pulled a goal back, Spurs were unable to find an equaliser as some brilliant last-ditch defending denied Jonathan Obika in the last minute. Leeds were in front through the game's first real chance on 15 minutes as Michael Brown's pass sent Varney clear of the Spurs defence and he kept his composure to finish past the recalled Brad Friedel. Spurs' response saw Gylfi Sigurdsson head over and Dempsey flicked a shot straight at Jamie Ashdown, while in between, Varney fired over for Leeds. More slack defending from Spurs presented the hosts with another opportunity just before half-time, but Friedel was out smartly to deny McCormack. However, there was nothing the veteran keeper could do five minutes after the interval when McCormack raced on to El Hadji Diouf's through ball before arrowing a left-footed shot past Friedel after cutting inside Steven Caulker. The Premier League side were much more purposeful in their response to conceding the second goal as former Leeds winger Aaron Lennon's dangerous cross was turned wide by Dempsey. Dempsey was more clinical on 58 minutes, though, darting to the near post to glance Gareth Bale's left-wing delivery beyond the reach of Ashdown. Andre Villas-Boas promptly introduced Obika and Mousa Dembele, who saw a shot from outside the box deflected wide on 71 minutes. But, just 60 seconds later, Spurs could have fallen further behind after McCormack scampered clear of the defence again, only to see his shot strike Friedel's leg. Spurs had one last chance to force a replay after Benoit Assou-Ekotto's raking long pass sent Obika clear, but the substitute took too long to bring the ball under control and Lee Peltier produced a superb block to ensure Leeds' progression.",Raw Data

655,"The 24-year-old Dallas Cowboys wide receiver has a fractured left index finger that requires surgery. But he could choose to play in Sunday's game with the aid of a splint. Bryant was seen during the media portion of Thursday's practice wearing a padded white glove that allowed the tip of his index finger to be exposed. Cowboys tight end Jason Witten and cornerback Brandon Carr both said Thursday that Bryant looked good catching the ball during practice. ""I took some reps today,"" Bryant said. ""I took quite a few."" Coach Jason Garrett confirmed Thursday morning that Bryant's Wednesday visit with a second hand specialist revealed ""pretty similar"" information to the first examination. ""We don't have a definitive plan for Dez right now,"" Garrett said Thursday. ""He did see the doctor yesterday. Nothing really changed. We're going to see how he feels today and see if there's a chance that he can play. He went through the walkthrough yesterday. He didn't do anything in practice yesterday. Seemed like he was feeling fine. But we have to make a decision there as to what we want to do. Dez is certainly a part of that decision. The medical analysis is part of that decision as well."" The Cowboys training staff is looking into splints and taping methods that would allow Bryant to play Sunday. ""He certainly has a willingness to play,"" Garrett said. ""He certainly has a toughness to play. We just have to see if he can function the way he needs to.""",Raw Data
656,"When you think of players who run up gaudy assist totals, the mind wanders to Magic Johnson’s no-look dishes for dunks or Steve Nash’s bounce passes that elude a maze of arms and legs to feed a layup. “You’re not going to see a lot of spectacular passes from me,” said Jose Calderon, who has seen just eight other NBA players dish out more assists since coming to the NBA for the 2006-07 season. “I’m not behind-the-back, between-the-legs or no-look. If the pass is there, the pass is going to get there, but easy passes. If it’s not there, I’m not going to risk it. I’ll throw lobs, but no fancy stuff. That’s not the way I play. I’m not that kind of guy.” The Pistons got glimpses of what Calderon offers in Wednesday’s game with Brooklyn, especially during Calderon’s seven-assist third quarter. Imagine what he can do after logging his first practice with the Pistons, which came Thursday afternoon. Calderon felt more comfortable Wednesday than he did in his debut against the Knicks on Monday – starting despite being cleared to play just six hours before tipoff – and felt more progress was made in Thursday’s practice. “Even today in practice, they’re looking every time,” he said of teammates learning to keep their antennae up. “I hit the guys for a few passes, ‘OK, the ball is coming.’ I think I surprised Moose a couple of times yesterday. It’s OK, the ball is going to get there. Even if he’s late, keep looking for it. I’ll be looking.” Calderon’s message to his teammates is to run the play as it was intended to be run, don’t just go through the motions because you might rarely be on the receiving end of a pass for any particular play. “Run the play,” he said. “Don’t just run the play because it’s the play. It’s because you can receive the pass at any time. It’s not just with me, it’s with them. They’ve got to change a little bit – not the way they play, but the way they’re able to run those plays sometimes.” “All of a sudden, every cut you weren’t making before and maybe you weren’t getting the ball,” Lawrence Frank said, “now you’re going to see guys – watch – they’re going to start ducking in harder, they’re going to start cutting harder. It’s running stuff with a purpose.” Frank appreciates the simple efficiency of Calderon’s passing, calling to mind what Jason Kidd gave him in his first career head coaching opportunity. “It’s hitting singles,” Frank said. “At the end of the day, it’s getting the job done. It’s funny watching some of these younger players and then you watch some of the older players, how efficient the older player is. I was blessed. I coached arguably one of the greatest point guards ever. And the amount of just regular meat-and-potatoes plays vs. sensational plays, meat and potatoes far outweighed it. It’s being efficient. It’s just substance; it’s not style.” The substance of Calderon extends to his very visible leadership skills. Calderon rarely lets a dead-ball situation go without (a) using the opportunity to impart or receive information, either with a teammate or a coach or (b) taking the time to pick up a teammate after a mistake or congratulate him for a success or (c) both. “I talk a lot,” he said. “I’m gesturing all the time, trying to get everyone involved, even if I’m on the bench. Everybody’s got to be ready. I just talk. Whatever I see, I just say it. I talk to my teammates about being open the next time. Because it’s going to happen – we’re going to run a play and I’m going to miss somebody, for sure, but if they tell me, I’ll say, ‘I see you but I see you late. Keep doing the same thing and I’ll get you next time.’ “I want to get them to trust me like they’re going to receive the ball. Right now, I’m thinking too much about plays to see where they’re going to get the ball. When that goes automatic, it’s going to be easier for everybody.” “When you go through this, everyone puts their toe in the water and it takes time,” Frank said. “The big picture, we’re going to go through some short-term pain – we are. Whether that’s wins or losses, there’s still going to be pain involved. Because you’re asking guys to do different things. But potential long-term gain.” Calderon’s investment in the process at every level should shorten the “pain” term and accelerate the “gain” term. In his four days with the team, he’s already started compiling mental catalogs of who looks the ball where and what to look for in particular situations. “You’re going to be more comfortable every day,” he said. “It’s about time, it’s about working together, it’s about knowing my teammates. I knew it was going to be a period of time. You’re going to have some balls go out of bounds and some passes aren’t going to find each other. But it’s normal. This is about being together and knowing each other so I can talk to the guys.” True Blue Pistons",Raw Data

Sports opinions? She’s never short of them. And love her or hate her, she’ll be just another one of the boys. Follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook. Forty Niners quarterback Colin Kaepernick had been waiting to do his turn answering journalist questions at the podium when Michael Crabtree walked in. Kaep deferred to his wide receiver, hanging back to listen. And he appeared, at least to my eye, to blush just a little as Crabtree described what he saw in a game in which Kaepernick passed for 263 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 181 yards (an NFL record for a quarterback in any game) and two more touchdowns. “The guy is playing football, man. He is making it happen. With his feet, with his arms, he’s just out there, making plays,” Crabtree said, properly summarizing the key points of Saturday night’s 45-31 San Francisco victory against Green Bay in the NFC divisional round. The danger is people will do what people always do, which is use what Kaepernick did to score points on whatever happens to be their NFL argument of choice — viability of the read-option as an NFL offense, Kaepernick’s staying power vs. that of say McNabb or Vick or RG3, the leadership ability of people with tattoos. If there is a lesson in Kaepernick, though, it is the danger of labels, of grouping him with anybody or of extrapolating anything else about any player past or present based on what he does. In a league where we love to label guys — running quarterback, pocket passer — he will only confuse you. He defies traditional labels. He runs like RG3. He passes like Aaron Rodgers. “I don’t want to be categorized,” Kaepernick said when I asked him afterward of our need to label players as this or that. It was one of the better answers I have heard from an NFL player in a long time, uttered with just enough hint of “bleep you” to suggest too that he already has tired of being squeezed into our boxes. It is not right to call him a running quarterback, though he ripped through Green Bay’s defense with ease. It is not right to call him a pocket passer, though he took turns with Rodgers throwing darts into teeny-tiny windows. It continued until Rodgers very unexpectedly blinked first. He is unapologetically him. This term running quarterback is weak anyway. All quarterbacks run to some extent, especially when chased. The thing about Kaepernick is he outruns. His second touchdown of the night, the 56-yard run that surpassed Steve McNair as the longest by a quarterback in the playoffs, included him blowing right by five Packer defenders. Like they never even laid a hand on him. “It’s one thing when you see a guy get behind a guy and they try to run and the guy already has a step,'' 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis said. ""But when the guys come across the field at an angle and he eats up the angle, that is fast.” Kaepernick had eclipsed the most running yards by a QB in an NFL playoff game by midway through the third quarter, when he had 163. So, of course, the instinct is to compare him to McNair and Donovan McNabb, Mike Vick and Vince Young, even rookies Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson. The sticky part is those comparisons come with questions, questions about durability and drop-back passing ability and long-term success that arose at different times about each of these players. And those questions do not seem to apply to Kaepernick. Because based on what we saw Saturday, there is just as relevant a comparison to Rodgers and Andrew Luck and Peyton Manning. He has devastating ability in both areas, and this makes him an absolute beast to deal with on a football field. At the heart of this is San Francisco coach Jim Harbaugh — what he believed he had in Kaepernick and his willingness to be wrong. There is no Kaepernick starting Saturday if Harbaugh is not willing to gamble, to eschew what is safe and most likely less prone to error (Alex Smith) for what had the potential to be spectacular (Kaepernick). This is one of the greatest skills a coach, and really a human, can have — the willingness to really step into the arena, to dare greatly, to be willing to fail, to trust your gut. Harbaugh was asked afterward if he felt like the correctness of his decision, switching from Smith to Kaepernick during the season, was on the line Saturday. He did not answer at all, instead delivering a little ""Friday Night Lights"" dialogue with talk of clear eyes and full hearts. “Uh, no,” he started before landing on the firmer ground of cliche. “I thought they competed like maniacs. And we have another week of work, so we’ll move on with humble hearts and get ready for our next opponent.” In this idiot world we live in, people were talking Smith after Kaepernick threw a pick-6 in the opening moments. It is a drum beat that only would have grown louder if the 49ers had lost. Instead, it will go the other way. He will be used as talking point. Carolina need not abandon its offense with Cam Newton. People with tattoos cannot only lead but kick ass. Teams need to go get themselves a “pistol”-running quarterback. And why? Because of what Kaepernick has done. He’s a better, faster version of Vick-McNabb-RG3, which is problematic because it simply is not true at all. He is not any version of those guys. Nor is he a version of anybody we are seeing in the NFL right now. He does not want to be categorized. Nor can he be.",Raw Data
659,"They walked into a Manhattan hotel, knowing they were running out of time to save their season. After 16 hours of tense talks, the NHL and its players finally achieved their elusive deal early Sunday morning, finding a way to restart a sport desperate to regain momentum and boost its prominence. Ending a bitter dispute that wiped out a large part of the hockey season for the third time in less than two decades, the league and its union agreed to the framework of a 10-year labor contract that will allow a delayed schedule to start later this month. On the 113th day of a management lockout and five days before the league's deadline for a deal, the bleary-eyed sides held a 6 a.m. news conference to announce there will be a season, after all. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and union head Donald Fehr both appeared drained, wearing sweaters and not neckties, when they stood side by side at the hotel and announced labor peace. ''We have reached an agreement on the framework of a new collective bargaining agreement, the details of which need to be put to paper,'' Bettman said. ''We've got to dot a lot of Is, cross a lot of Ts. There's still a lot of work to be done, but the basic framework of the deal has been agreed upon.'' Lawyers will spend the next few days drafting a memorandum of agreement. The stoppage led to the cancellation of at least 480 games - the exact length of the curtailed schedule hasn't been determined - bringing the total of lost regular-season games to a minimum 2,178 during three lockouts under Bettman. The agreement, which replaces the deal that expired Sept. 15, must be ratified by the 30 team owners and approximately 740 players. ''Hopefully, within just a very few days, the fans can get back to watching people who are skating, and not the two of us,'' Fehr said. Fehr became executive director of the NHL Players Association in December 2010 after leading baseball players through two strikes and a lockout. Players conceded early on in talks, which began in June, that they would accept a smaller percentage of revenue, and the negotiations were about how much lower. ''It was a battle,'' said Winnipeg Jets defenseman Ron Hainsey, a key member of the union's bargaining team. ''Players obviously would rather not have been here, but our focus now is to give the fans whatever it is - 48 games, 50 games - the most exciting season we can.'' With much of the money from its $2 billion, 10-year contract with NBC back loaded toward the Stanley Cup playoffs in the spring - and now perhaps early summer - the league preferred to time the dispute for the start of the season in the fall. Management made its decision knowing regular-season attendance rose from 16,534 in 2003-04 to 16,954 in 2005-06 and only seven teams experienced substantial drops. Flyers chairman Ed Snider told The Associated Press he was glad a partial schedule had been salvaged. ''I'm thrilled for our fans, I'm thrilled for all of our people that work around our sport that have been hurt by this,'' he said. ''I'm thrilled for the players, for the owners. I'm just sorry it had to take this long. The great thing is, we don't have to look at it for hopefully 10 years, or at worst eight, and that's good stuff.'' Still, the lockout could wipe out perhaps $1 billion in revenue this season, given about 40 percent of the regular-season schedule won't be played. And while the stoppage was major news in Canada, it was an afterthought for many American sports fans. ''They could have gotten here a lot sooner,'' said Marc Ganis, president of Chicago-based sports business consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd. ''They didn't hear a hue and cry from the fans, especially in the United States, when hockey wasn't played. That's very distressing. That indicates there's a level of apathy that is troubling. In contrast, in the NFL when there was a threat of canceling a preseason weekend, the nation was up in arms.'' At downtown Detroit's Rub BBQ Pub, manager Chris Eid said he was ''ecstatic'' when he heard the news. He said the settlement was a big topic of conversation among his afternoon customers. ''Everyone misses hockey,'' Eid said. Hockey's first labor dispute was an 11-day strike in 1992 that led to 30 games being postponed. Bettman, a former NBA executive under David Stern, became the NHL commissioner in February 1993. He presided over a 103-day lockout in 1994-95 that ended with a deal on Jan. 11, then a 301-day lockout in 2004-05 that made the NHL the first major North American professional sports league to lose an entire season. The NHL obtained a salary cap in the agreement that followed that dispute and now wanted more gains. ''It was concessionary bargaining right from the beginning,'' Phoenix Coyotes captain Shane Doan said. ''As the players, you kind of understand that and you accepted that. As much as you didn't want to, we understand that the nature of professional sports has kind of changed with the last couple CBAs starting with football and basketball.'' This deal was reached with the assistance of Scot Beckenbaugh of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a veteran of the 2004-05 NHL talks, then Major League Soccer's negotiations in 2010 and NFL and NBA talks the following year. Beckenbaugh spent Friday walking back and forth between the league's office and the hotel where players were staying, meeting with each side to set up the final talks. ''Fans throughout North America will have the opportunity to return to a favorite past time and thousands of working men and women and small businesses will no longer be deprived of their livelihoods,'' said George Cohen, the FMCS director. Sam Flood, NBC Sports' executive producer, said his production team was ''counting the seconds until the season begins.'' NBC announcer Mike Emrick said players will have more pressure because of the shortened schedule. ''The effect of even a two-game losing streak will be four,'' he said The NHL's revenue of $3.3 billion last season lagged well behind the NFL ($9 billion), Major League Baseball ($7.5 billion) and the NBA ($5 billion), and the deal will lower the hockey players' percentage from 57 to 50 - owners originally had proposed 46 percent. This was the third lockout among the major U.S. sports in a period of just over a year. A four-month NFL lockout ended in July 2011 with the loss of only one exhibition game, and an NBA lockout caused each team's schedule to be cut from 82 games to 66 last season. -Players will receive $300 million in transition payments over three years to account for existing contracts, pushing their revenue share over 50 percent at the start of the deal. -Players gained a defined benefit pension plan for the first time. -The salary cap for this season will be $70.2 million before prorating to adjust for the shortened season, and the cap will drop to $64.3 million in 2013-14 - the same amount as 2011-12. There will be a salary floor of $44 million in those years. -Free agents will be limited to contracts of seven years (eight for those re-signed with their former club). -Salaries within a contract may not vary by more than 35 percent year to year, and the lowest year must be at least 50 percent of the highest year. -There were no changes to eligibility for free agency and salary arbitration. -The threshold for teams to release players in salary arbitration will increase from $1.75 million to $3 million. -Each team may use two buyouts to terminate contracts before the 2013-14 or 2014-15 seasons for two-thirds of the remaining guaranteed income. The buyout will be included in the players' revenue share but not the salary cap. -The minimum salary will remain at $525,000 this season and will rise to $750,000 by 2021-12. -Either side may terminate the deal after the 2019-20 season. -Revenue sharing will increase to $200 million annually and rise with revenue. -An industry growth fund of $60 million will be funded by the sides over three years and replenished as need. -Participation of NHL and its players in the 2014 Sochi Olympics will be determined later in discussions also involving the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation.",Raw Data

661,"Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com. He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. In 2012, there was no such thing as a mediocre American League team. It was a year of eight contenders and six also-rans, separated by a distance wider than the vast left-center gap at Seattle’s Safeco Field. Consider: The National League had five teams win between 76 and 84 games. The American League had none — the first time that happened in either league during the wild card era, according to STATS LLC. But as is the case with Safeco — where the fences are moving in this winter — perhaps the AL’s competitive gap will close in 2013. While the defending champion Tigers should be more talented this year than in 2012 — Anibal Sanchez is back, Torii Hunter has arrived, and Victor Martinez is expected to return from injury — the league’s bottom six teams made sincere efforts to improve, with varying degrees of success. Here’s our assessment of those half-dozen teams, ranking their moves (not necessarily their postseason chances) from best to worst. For each club, the key question is this: To what extent have they meaningfully addressed the weaknesses that left them with a losing record in 2012? Blue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos has turned over roughly half his 25-man roster since the middle of last season, and he did so with names you know. Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates. Reigning National League Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey, four-time All-Star Mark Buehrle and two-time All-Star Josh Johnson now account for 60 percent of the Toronto rotation. If holdovers Ricky Romero and Brandon Morrow pitch up to their potential, the Blue Jays could have the game’s best starting staff. The lineup underwent a similar transformation. For the season opener, John Gibbons’ lineup likely will include no more than three of the players John Farrell used in Game 162 last year. Jose Reyes and Maicer Izturis are the new middle infield, with Melky Cabrera taking over in left with a chance to resurrect his reputation and career. Super-utility dynamo Emilio Bonifacio was the most underrated acquisition of them all. I’m concerned about the heightened expectations placed on star personalities unfamiliar with one another, but Jose Bautista has the stature to resolve any chemistry issues by becoming the undisputed leader of this team. In the end, Bautista and Blue Jays fans have what they wanted for years — a roster capable of winning the World Series. Even coming off a 73-89 season, a playoff berth is regarded as the minimum threshold for a successful season in Toronto. The Red Sox have had a good offseason. Not great, but good. And yet, there’s still a chance they will finish fourth or fifth in the balanced AL East. The Red Sox used to be MLB's lovable idiots, but fans are no longer amused by their antics. If you believed (as I did) that they needed to change their clubhouse culture, well, the additions of Shane Victorino, Jonny Gomes, David Ross and (finally) Mike Napoli should make for a more professional environment. The bullpen will be better, too. Instead of Bobby Valentine clumsily choosing between Alfredo Aceves and Mark Melancon to begin the year, the even-tempered Farrell has Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey to close, with Koji Uehara and (maybe) Daniel Bard to offer stability in the seventh and eighth innings. The biggest concern remains the rotation. Newly signed Ryan Dempster doesn’t exactly have a robust track record in the American League, and returning starters Jon Lester, Clay Buchholz and Felix Doubront must improve upon ERAs of 4.82, 4.56 and 4.86, respectively. As it stands today, the Red Sox have no better than a mediocre starting rotation when compared with the rest of the league. And mediocre starting rotations tend to produce mediocre seasons. The Royals were roundly criticized for parting with super-prospect Wil Myers in their blockbuster with Tampa Bay. Yet, look at their rotation now: James Shields, Jeremy Guthrie, Ervin Santana, Wade Davis and Luis Mendoza, Bruce Chen or Luke Hochevar. Follow the latest baseball moves with our transaction tracker. Is it on par with Detroit’s? No. But it’s probably second best in the AL Central, close enough that Kansas City is within striking distance in the event of a significant pitching injury on the Tigers’ staff. Yes, general manager Dayton Moore largely failed to address a lineup that finished third from the bottom of the AL in runs scored. It seems he’s wagering (quite reasonably) that the maturation of Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas, along with a full season of Salvador Perez, will improve the offensive output organically. And he may be right. In general, the Royals made enough upgrades that they will be the trendy pick to finish second in the division. My analogy for the Indians: They ended the season with two torn UCLs and only had Tommy John surgery on one. Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? The Indians had the worst ERA in the AL last year (4.78). They also scored the second-fewest runs — a shortcoming GM Chris Antonetti addressed with the acquisitions of Nick Swisher and Mark Reynolds. Unfortunately, neither of them can pitch. Cleveland’s starting rotation doesn’t look much better than the one that flopped in 2012: Justin Masterson is not a true No. 1; Ubaldo Jimenez has been a disappointment in Cleveland; Brett Myers was a reliever in 2012; Zach McAllister was a pleasant surprise last year; Carlos Carrasco is a question mark coming off Tommy John surgery. Many observers believe the three-team trade with Arizona and Cincinnati was a win for the Indians, as they acquired high-end starter Trevor Bauer and talented outfielder Drew Stubbs. But the deal also cost them Shin-Soo Choo, arguably their best all-around player. The Indians should be better in 2013. But they didn’t make a game-changing move this winter. The Mariners wanted to sign Josh Hamilton. He went to the division rival Angels. They had a trade in place for Justin Upton. He rejected it. So, rebuffed in his effort to acquire a lineup-altering, All-Star slugger, Seattle general manager Jack Zduriencik opted for quantity. He signed Jason Bay. He traded for Kendrys Morales. He signed Raul Ibañez. And Wednesday, he parted with catcher John Jaso in a three-way deal that brought Mike Morse back to Seattle. Our experts bring you all latest offseason news. Read MLB Buzz. The Mariners, who finished last in the AL with 619 runs last year, absolutely will have an improved lineup in 2013. That was going to happen, anyway, considering potential mainstays Jesus Montero, Dustin Ackley and Kyle Seager have gained valuable major-league experience. But my greatest concern about the Mariners is that so much of their plan hinges on Montero’s ability to be an everyday catcher at age 23. There were questions about that when Seattle acquired him from the Yankees. And there are questions about that now, after advanced defensive metrics did not look favorably upon his 56 games behind the plate in 2012. If Montero has to become the DH roughly 70 percent of the time or more, Zduriencik will need to call yet another audible. That probably will involve promoting 2012 first-round pick Mike Zunino to become the everyday catcher. (Zunino amassed an OPS of 1.137 in his first 44 minor-league games.) In sum, the Mariners’ recent moves suggest they are prepared to give up on the disappointing Justin Smoak, a centerpiece of the Cliff Lee trade three years ago. Another worry: The Mariners must add at least one reliable starting pitcher from the outside to replace Jason Vargas, who went to the Angels in the Morales trade. The Twins barely avoided finishing 2012 with the AL’s worst team ERA, a sign that general manager Terry Ryan needed to overhaul his pitching staff this offseason. He’s made a number of moves, but the most impactful upgrades — Trevor May and Alex Meyer, who arrived in trades for Ben Revere and Denard Span, respectively — are prospects who could have little immediate impact on the Twins’ major-league fortunes. See which players and managers will work in a new city in 2013. Ryan added three starters who spent last year in the National League — Kevin Correia, Mike Pelfrey and Vance Worley — and it’s hard to envision any of them as a No. 1 or No. 2 starter in the AL this year. (Pelfrey probably has the highest upside but is coming off Tommy John surgery.) Lefty Scott Diamond is the top holdover, but he underwent offseason surgery to remove a bone chip from his pitching elbow. The Twins’ routine postseason appearances are receding further into the past, and this rotation won't be able to outpitch the Royals or White Sox, to say nothing of the Tigers. The lineup is creeping closer to league average, with Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau healthy again. But these Twins won’t finish with a winning record, unless their rotation improves drastically between now and Opening Day.",Raw Data
662,"If records are meant to be broken, is it wrong to invent new ones when we’ve run out of the old, laying in fragments all around us? On Tuesday, Barcelona's Lionel Messi scored twice against Spartak Moscow. The much-loved trickster will endeavor to get closer to smashing up the next supposedly meaningful record in his path, to relegating it to the pile already in tatters alongside his vaporized trail. Since January 1 of this year, Messi has scored 52goals in the Spanish Primera Division, five goals in Spanish cup competitions, 13 goals in the UEFA Champions League and a dozen for Argentina’s national team. 80 goals in all. That’s five short of the 85 Gerd Muller scored for West Germany and Bayern Munich in 1972. Didn’t know that? Me neither. But Messi now so transcends his sport that we’re clutching onto weird, hurriedly contrived records just to frame the unprecedented parameters of his greatness. Barca’s overgrown star – newly a father, a somewhat perturbing image – with the furious little feet breaks records in such a blur of precision and competence that we’re forced to come up with new ones for him to break. The latest product manufactured by Messi’s “Mania Megahype Machine” (trademark pending): the single-calendar-year-goalscoring-across-all-competitions-both-on-club-and-international-level record. It’s an obscure record at best, by a very prominent player from an era of yore. This pseudo-record doesn’t even have a Wikipedia entry, our age’s great legitimizer. Because we don’t typically tabulate goals by the calendar year in soccer, that’s what seasons are for. But we now reach for Muller’s little-known high-water mark. Because there was nothing else left for Messi to break. He shattered the all-competitions single-season scoring record with 73 goals last season (also previously Muller’s at 67) and, at 25, is already Barca’s all-time scoring leader too. There’s no marketable narrative in pushing further into atmosphere breathed by no other man. It doesn’t speak to the imagination. Not in soccer anyway; only in space exploration and eating competitions. A record long since splintered and still in the process of being repositioned is uninteresting in its own right. Something superhuman is only identifiable as that when painted against a background humanity. As we lumber heavily after the lithe Argentinean, gasping in pursuit of a phenomenon that does things at such unfathomable speed, our own challenge is to keep up and define what it is that we’re seeing, to explore the outer boundaries of soccer’s universe. That means employing bizarre measurements. Because combining club and international goals into a single tally is that. They are different spheres. Some point out that Messi has already played more games in 2012 than Muller did in 1972 (61 to 60), underscore the problems with this comparison. This is another era. The sport Muller knew isn’t the one Messi does. Muller’s was slower and more open. There wasn’t as much emphasis on defense then. And the gap between strong countries like West Germany and the weak ones, or strong clubs like Bayern and weak ones, was bigger. But then Messi has better science and information at his service, one could counter. Yes, but Messi doesn’t even really play as an outright striker and piles up heaps of assists while Muller was a poacher with no concern other than to score goals, contributing little else. Wait, but Messi has Xavi. There’s no comparing players from different eras. Everything is different; materials, coaching, sports science, accommodations and transportation. Even the game itself. But then how do we express the significance of something undoubtedly special? How to measure transcendence? Perhaps the best form of deference in this case, rather than invent new terms of dominance, however problematic within their historical context, is to simply acknowledge that this ethereal greatness cannot be grasped or defined or contextualized completely. It is beyond records.

663,"With no clear favorite entering spring practice, the Big 12 should be college footballs most intriguing conference to watch when preseason picks are released for 2013. Oklahoma State, TCU, Oklahoma and Texas seem to be the early favorites for next season, but Kansas State and Baylor cant be counted out. The Horned Frogs should be better in their second tour through the Big 12, while the Cowboys will be a dangerous team if they can settle on one quarterback. It may seem strange to say this for two high-profile programs, but Oklahoma and Texas are the two darkhorse teams to watch in spring practice. The Longhorns have shown some small progress over the last few years and have the talent to win the Big 12. Oklahoma is coming off a 10-3 season but must replace quarterback Landry Jones and rebuild a defense that allowed 398.3 yards per game last year. The Big 12 had only one head coaching change this offseason, as Kliff Kingsbury returns to Lubbock to take over for Tommy Tuberville at Texas Tech. Kingsbury helped to engineer some of the nations best offenses at Houston and Texas A&M and should be able to immediately put his stamp on the program in 2013. Big 12 Team Spring Storylines and Quarterback Battles to Watch Baylor Can the defense continue to make progress? Baylors final defensive numbers certainly werent anything to be proud of. The Bears finished 2012 ranked 110th nationally in scoring and 119th in yards allowed. However, there were encouraging signs over the final few games of the year, which included a solid performance against UCLA in the Holiday Bowl. Now that coordinator Phil Bennett has been in Waco for two years, the Bears should have a good grasp on his system and more improvement is expected in 2013. And this unit has promising talent returning, including safety Ahmad Dixon, linebacker Bryce Hager and defensive end Terrance Lloyd. With the momentum from the 2012 finish, combined with seven returning starters, Baylors defense should show more progress in 2013. Considering the Bears will have a new starter at quarterback, its important for the defense to help shoulder more of the burden this year. Quarterback Battle? Can the Bears continue their recent run of successful quarterbacks? Nick Florence departs after an outstanding year, leaving junior Bryce Petty as the No. 1 passer this spring. Redshirt freshman Seth Russell and true freshman Chris Johnson will get a look this spring, but Petty is expected to be Baylors starting quarterback in 2013. Iowa State Finding replacements at linebacker Quarterback and linebacker seem like they will be the focus almost universally in the Big 12 this spring. Maybe nowhere in the nation, however, is that more apparent than at Iowa State. The Cyclones must replace two All-American-caliber linebackers from a defense that ranked third in the Big 12 in points allowed. A.J. Klein won co-Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year two years ago and finished his career with 361 tackles. Jake Knott posted 347 stops of his own. Talented tackler Jeremiah George is a good starting point but other names will need to step into more prominent roles at linebacker for the Cyclones to reach the postseason for the third consecutive season. Kansas Restocking the offensive line While the defense is a huge concern, the Jayhawks have to be concerned about their offensive line with the departure of three starters from last seasons unit. Left tackle Tanner Hawkinson was the groups biggest departure, but center Trevor Marrongelli and guard Duane Zlatnik will also be missed. Considering the only real strength with Kansas last season was the rushing attack, the new pieces on the offensive line have to jell together this spring. The Jayhawks are counting on junior college recruits Mike Smithburg and Ngalu Fuismalohi to fill the gaps at guard, while senior Aslam Sterling should be the starter at right tackle. However, the two most important positions on the line left tackle and center are up for grabs. Converted defensive lineman Pat Lewandowski is the frontrunner at left tackle, while sophomore Dylan Admire is listed No. 1 on the spring depth chart at center. Admire played in all 12 games last season but doesnt have a start under his belt. If this unit struggles, Kansas offense will have trouble getting running back Sims on track, along with giving quarterback Jake Heaps time to throw. Kansas State Rebuild the linebacking corps Arthur Brown eventually turned into a superstar at Kansas State and was a key factor in the teams success over the last two years. However, Brown and four other contributors have departed the linebacking position. In fact, the Wildcats boasted seven senior linebackers on the roster in 2012, so Bill Snyder has his work cut out for him this spring. The defensive line and secondary lose a lot as well, so the entire defense needs work, but rebuilding should start in the middle at linebacker. Jonathan Truman, Tre Walker and Mike Moore are the only players returning to the position with any experience at all. Quarterback Battle Breakdown: Daniel Sams (SO) vs. Jake Waters (JR) While Collin Klein will be missed, Kansas State has two solid options to turn to under center this season. Sams was impressive in limited action last year, while Waters threw for 3,501 yards and 39 touchdowns at Iowa Western Community College in 2012. Considering both quarterbacks have no starts at the FBS level, this battle could extend deep into the fall. Oklahoma Find a supporting cast for Aaron Colvin in the secondary Oklahomas defense has major holes to fill at a variety of positions, but three of the starting four defensive backs from 2012 have departed the team. The top four tacklers last season were defensive backs which should indicate just how much the front seven struggled last year and three of them are gone, including the teams most talented player and leading tackler Tony Jefferson. Only Aaron Colvin returns, and Bob Stoops needs to find him support this spring. Quarterback Battle Breakdown: Blake Bell (JR) vs. Trevor Knight (FR) vs. Kendal Thompson (SO) While the Sooners are listed as a battle, its hard to see Knight or Thompson unseating Bell. The Kansas native needs to show he can be a consistent passer but has scored 24 rushing scores in limited action. The battle between Knight and Thompson for No. 2 could be the bigger storyline to watch, especially since the winner of that competition is in line to start if Bell struggles. Oklahoma State Who steps up at defensive end? The Cowboys dont have many glaring issues to work on in spring practice, but the defensive end spot is a concern for coordinator Glenn Spencer. Oklahoma State loses three key contributors from last season, as Cooper Bassett, Nigel Nicholas and Ryan Robinson expired their eligibility after the bowl win against Purdue. Tyler Johnson is the most experienced option on the outside and he recorded 27 tackles and four sacks last season. Outside of Johnson, theres not much in the way of proven options. Sam Wren ranked as the No. 16 junior college prospect by ESPN and could win the other starting end spot. True freshman Naim Mustafaa enrolled early to compete in the spring and figures to play a prominent role in the rotation. However, even if Wren and Mustafaa emerge as solid options, depth is still an issue. Expect the defensive staff to spend a lot of time watching the trenches in spring practice. Quarterback Battle Breakdown: Clint Chelf (SR) vs. Wes Lunt (SO) vs. J.W. Walsh (SO) Despite three quarterbacks making starts for Oklahoma State in 2012, the Cowboys finished third nationally and averaged 547 yards per game. All three passers are back this spring, and Oklahoma State should have one of the most intriguing quarterback battles in the nation. Wes Lunt began last season as the starter but lost his job due to an injury. Walsh and Chelf played well in Lunts absence, with Chelf finishing the year as the No. 1 quarterback. Texas Stop the run without Alex Okafor Getting star front seven players Jackson Jeffcoat and Jordan Hicks back healthy will obviously go a long way to improving one of the most underachieving units in the nation. Filling holes left by end Alex Okafor and tackle Brandon Moore and stabilizing this unit could be the difference between a conference championship or pink slip for Mack Brown. Manny Diaz needs to figure out a way to improve a defense that allowed 88th nationally in rushing defense. There is a definite sense of urgency with this portion of the depth chart this spring. TCU Replace two All-Big 12 blockers up front This team has few weaknesses heading into 2013 and will feature one of the leagues best defenses. Gary Patterson also has two quality options under center as well. Losing guard Blaize Foltz and center James Fry, two All-Big 12 performers from a year ago, will hurt the middle of the offensive line. Foltz was the best lineman on the team and the pivot is a critical position, so filling the gaps inside along the line is key for TCU this spring. Quarterback Battle Breakdown: Trevone Boykin (SO) vs. Casey Pachall (SR) Considering the Horned Frogs have the pieces in place to win the Big 12, this offense needs Pachall to return to his 2011 form. Despite missing eight games last season due to an off-the-field incident, Pachall is expected to edge Boykin for the starting job this spring, but Boykin will have some role on the offense in 2013. Texas Tech Rebuilding in the secondary One year after allowing 485.6 yards per game, the Red Raiders were one of the nations most-improved defenses. Texas Tech ranked second in the Big 12 by allowing 367.3 yards per game, while finishing first in pass defense. This unit struggled later in the season, but theres no question the Red Raiders were better on this side of the ball in 2012. In addition to a new coaching staff taking over, Texas Tech has significant question marks in the secondary. Cornerbacks Cornelius Douglas and Eugene Neboh, along with safeties Cody Davis and D.J. Johnson have expired their eligibility, which leaves the Red Raiders with just one returning starter in the defensive backfield. Cornerback Tre Porter is a good place to start rebuilding, while Bruce Jones, Jarvis Phillips, Derrick Mays and Ola Falemi return with experience. While theres at least some depth at cornerback, the safety position is virtually empty. J.J. Gaines and John White are the only returning safeties on the roster, and the duo combined for just nine tackles in 2012. Incoming freshman Jalen Barnes and junior college recruit Martin Hill could be asked to play a lot in 2013, which is particularly bad news in an offensive-minded league like the Big 12. West Virginia Who will emerge as the top receivers? All eyes in Morgantown will be focused on the defense in the spring, but the receiving corps shouldnt be overlooked. Gone are standouts Tavon Austin and Stedman Bailey, along with Ryan Nehlen and J.D. Woods. The units top returning receivers are Jordan Thompson (13 catches) and Connor Arlia (7), so its easy to see why the coaching staff is bringing in five players in the 2013 recruiting class at the position, including three junior college recruits. True freshman Shelton Gibson is also expected to get into the mix this fall. With a new quarterback and virtually new receiving corps, it may take some time for West Virginia to work out the kinks in the passing game. However, in an offensive-minded league with a questionable defense, the Mountaineers will need to win their share of shootouts in 2013. Quarterback Battle Breakdown: Ford Childress (FR) vs. Paul Millard (JR) Millard has the edge in experience (34 career passes), but the West Virginia coaching staff is excited to see what Childress can do with the No. 1 offense. The Houston native ranked as the No. 18 recruit in the 2012 signing class and spent last season learning the ropes as a redshirt. Even though Millard has the edge in game experience, this is Childress job to lose.",Raw Data
664,"A deal worth around £3million is understood to have been finalized, and the player is due to arrive in England early next week. Stoke want to put Shea through a couple of days of training to assess his fitness, as he has not played since August after undergoing foot surgery. But if Shea confirms his fitness, then Stoke will press ahead with a deal for the American international - rated as one of their finest prospects. Shea had three goals and two assists in 21 games for FC Dallas before missing the final month with an abdominal strain stemming from the foot injury. He had 11 goals in 2011. The 22-year-old has 15 caps with the U.S. national team, but missed two World Cup qualifiers with the injury. The final round of World Cup qualifying starts in February. Shea returned to Jurgen Klinsmann's plans for the first time since a Feb. 29 exhibition at Italy. Shea was suspended for three Major League Soccer games for kicking the ball at an assistant referee during a game on May 17, then was benched for two games by Schellas Hyndman after arguing with the FC Dallas coach when he was taken out of a game on July 18. He also was part of the U.S. under-23 team that failed to qualify for the Olympics. ''I had good conversations the last week with Schellas Hyndman of FC Dallas and we both see a lot of upside in Brek Shea,'' US coach Klinsmann said during a conference call last year. ''We all knew that after the big disappointment of not qualifying for the Olympics that our youngsters from that program would eventually fall into a hole. They would go through emotional roller-coasters. That's what happened with Brek, he went through an emotional roller-coaster and he didn't have himself under control.'' ''We think he needs our support and the feeling that we're there when things get tough,'' Klinsmann said. ''Brek has to learn to focus in and learn to become a full professional 24-7 and learn that the highest priority is what you deliver on the field and learn how to live off the field, and he's in the middle of that process. ""We coaches are responsible to help him in that process. We are happy to have him back and we'll have a couple good talks over a few coffees.''

665,"As Rafael Nadal sat down in his chair at the end of the third set of Monday night's brutal US Open final against Novak Djokovic, for a split second, he was on his way back. The Spaniard had been hustling, clawing, scraping his way through a match that Djokovic was winning by a seemingly peerless scoreline. A two-sets to love lead, with just five games dropped, that was all about depth. Nadal was short, Djokovic was deep. But in the third set, an 84-minute torture-fest that fried the already fragile nerves of tennis fans around the world, Nadal remembered who he was. Rafa. The ultimate warrior. One of the most mentally complete tennis players there has ever been. The man who terrifies opponents with a single raised eyebrow, the picture of elemental brute force. The forehands that had been struggling over the service line were suddenly fizzing through the deco turf, the slice backhand that had as much bite as a soft cheese began to push Djokovic back, and the two enused in a all-court tug of war that had the entire stadium doing serious damage to their fingernails. Breaking the skinny Serb as he served for the title, Nadal lip-curled his way back into contention, feeding off Djokovic's aching back and suddenly worried disposition. Dominating the tie-break, Rafa managed to avoid not winning a set in a Grand Slam final for the first time. But when he bounced off his chair to begin the fourth set, something curious happened. The same thing as had happened at Wimbledon. He had absolutely nothing left. No answers. No way back. It was starkly reminscent of the way Roger Federer fell apart against Nadal in the final set of their Australian Open final in 2009. Federer had been meant to win that match. Nadal had been run through the washing machine by Fernando Verdasco in a very late five-set semi-final, so exhausted by the end that the pair practically held each other up as they hugged at the net. Instead, he could only watch helplessly as the Spaniard made a mockery of their epic rivalry, screaming through the final set 6-2. And then came the tears. Federer blubbed at the microphone as he tried to justify to himself how he had lost to this man yet again. ""Tennis is, more than most sports, a sport of the mind;"" Nadal writes in his autobiography. ""It is the player who has those good sensations on the most days, who manages to isolate himself best from his fears and from the ups and downs in morale a match inevitably brings."" ""With Federer, you have to put him under pressure, wear him down. Probe chinks that way in his game and his morale. Frustrate him, drive him close to despair, if you can."" That Nadal leads their head-to-head by 17-8 is all the proof you need that it works. Nadal took Wimbledon, he took the No 1 ranking, he took the Australian Open, and then he took the career grand slam, took them all from Federer. And now with a sense of almost poetic reciprocity, Djokovic is doing the same thing to him. At the start of this year, their head-to-head was 16-7 in Nadal's favour. That lead has been cut to 16-13. Having never won a single one of their five meetings in a tournament final, in 2011, the Serb has won all six. Having never beaten the Spaniard on clay in nine previous matches, in 2011, Djokovic has done so twice. And having taken Nadal's Wimbledon crown and the No 1 ranking, on Monday Djokovic took the US Open too. Only Nadal, a man who admits he is constantly battling against his own self-doubt, knows how much it has affected him. ""I have to accept that I won a lot in the past,"" he said, his turn to try and hold back the tears as he spoke to the Flushing Meadows crowd. ""Six straight losses, for sure that's painful,"" he said. ""But I'm going to work every day until that changes. [You must] accept the challenge and work."" But what exactly he needs to work on is at the root of his perplexion. He believes Djokovic is a better player because he makes less mistakes. Djokovic believes he is a better player simply because he believes he is. Admittedly, Nadal's execution was not inculpable. He hit short, he served slow. But it is the tactical puzzle that seems to be weighing most heavily on his brain. Just as Nadal makes Federer boil over in his search for answers, Djokovic strings Nadal around the court as he seeks a way through. Just like Nadal uses his forehand to pummel the Federer backhand, Djokovic's forehand shoots through the Nadal backhand. And, perhaps most tellingly, just the way Federer frames shots against Nadal he would never dream of missing against anyone else, Nadal sends his weapons long and wide when he plays Djokovic. That is where the breakthrough is needed. But if anyone can do it, Rafa can. Two days after their four hour and 10 minute battle, both players are already back on the court, four months of practice ahead of them between now and the next Grand Slam. That's a lot of time for things to change. After all, it's the time it took Djokovic to become almost invincible.",Raw Data

But in case not, in case he’s tempted by the lavish sums the Brooklyn Nets’ billionaire owner might fling at him in the coming week or the burning urge to rush into his revenge against the Los Angeles Lakers for hiring someone else this season, here’s some sound advice. Do not come back this season, Phil. Put that Zen stuff to good use. Use patience, wisdom and self-awareness and understand it’s in your best interest to sit on those 11 rings and wait until the 2013-14 season to take over a head-coaching job with any NBA franchise, particularly the Nets. League sources have confirmed to FOXSports.com the multiple reports that Jackson, the former Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers head coach, is the sole target of the Brooklyn Nets head-coaching search after the team fired Avery Johnson last week. These sources believe Nets owner and Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov will meet in Europe with his inner circle shortly after the New Year, formulate a specific offer for Jackson without the input of general manager Billy King and shortly thereafter make their pitch to Jackson for his services. They also speculate Jackson will give it serious consideration, pointing to the following reasons he might take the job: * Prokhorov, who likes to call rival Knicks owner James Dolan “that little man,” will happily pay to land a star like Jackson as a way to both rejuvenate his mediocre team and one-up the Knicks in a New York market where it’s as much about buzz as wins. * Jackson, after being passed over for the Lakers job this season for Mike D’Antoni, said he wants to coach again, can’t get enough of the media spotlight and his own burning need to be relevant. There are few places to satiate this like New York City. * The East is so awful, with the Miami Heat being the only true title contender and the rival Knicks team more of a paper tiger than threat, Jackson would face low standards in relation to guarding his legacy. An Eastern Conference Finals, Prokhorov stated goal, would be the public-relations equivalent of winning it all. * The Nets, as poorly constructed as they are, do have a team well-suited for Jackson’s triangle offense: A jump-shooting point guard in Deron Wiliams, a two-guard athletic enough to be a high-impact play maker in Joe Johnson, and a very good big man in Brook Lopez. * Jackson wants to coach, and there are few great jobs that will open up in the coming year. All of this makes sense. But it is in Jackson’s best interest to hold fast, tell the Russians he wants to wait until the offseason to decide on the job and roll the dice that a better situation can and will emerge. For Jackson, this makes sense for several reasons. The first is that the Nets are simply not a team with a roster built to his basketball standards despite their ability to fit into his system. Gerald Wallace is tied up at $10 million a year for three more seasons after this one. Williams has regressed from one of the game’s best point guards to someone who looks ineffectual and worth much less than his five-year max contract. And Joe Johnson’s own enormous deal makes him one of the most expensive one-on-one players of all time. And while it’s true there will be few NBA jobs open in the summer that would entice Jackson more than the Nets gig, there is one surprising but entirely possible head-coaching opportunity that is worth waiting for: The Los Angeles Clippers job. Despite the Clippers 17-game winning streak and league-best 25-6 record, there are a host of reasons to look toward the future and think current head coach Vinny Del Negro could end up not returning next season. Del Negro is in the last year of his contract, and Clippers point guard Chris Paul, the key to the organization’s future and whose own contract is up at the end of the year, could have a huge say in who becomes the Clippers next head coach. That power to select a coach will be a key selling point in enticing Paul to stick around Los Angeles. The reason Paul and the Clippers could tap someone else rests with the sneaky fact the Clippers have a team tailor-made for regular season excellence and postseason letdowns. Much like last season, when they started 15-7 (they started 16-6 this season), the Clippers could find themselves transitioning from the hype of the league early to overmatched in the playoffs, which are an entirely different animal. They score 17.7 fast-break points per game, the third most in the league and up significantly from 11 fast-break points per game last season. That’s fine right now, but relying on those points in transition will not work nearly as effectively in the postseason, when defenses tighten up and the half-court game takes prominence. The Clippers also boast a top-tier bench, another factor that offers huge help in the regular seasons that feature back-to-back and three-game-in-four-night stretches but loses its impact in post-season play, when rotations tighten up and the breaks between games negate the depth factor. Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan’s woeful free-throw shooting? Jamal Crawford’s equally woeful defense? They, too, will factor into how differently the Clippers perform in the playoffs. Throw in the fact Del Negro will likely be severely out-coached at least by the second round of the playoffs, as he was by Gregg Popovich in the Spurs’ sweep of the Clippers last season, and this regular season is in no way an indication Phil Jackson won’t have the best stick-it-up-your-craw job in sports to use as his personal Lakers-revenge weapon. No, the Clippers' 17-game winning streak is less proof that Del Negro is here to stay and more a way to raise expectations he and his team may not be able to meet come the playoffs. Look at it this way. If the Clippers this season end up losing a second-round playoff series to Memphis, San Antonio, Oklahoma City or a rejuvenated Lakers team — either one entirely plausible — there is little doubt Del Negro would be on the hot seat. So the idea of putting the Phil Jackson decision off until the summer makes sense for Billy King, too, not that anyone other than Billy King probably cares. League sources — to say nothing of the obvious — say the fact King was a bystander in Johnson’s firing means his own job security remains perilous at best. Jackson's arrival — with his need for power, the right to make personnel decisions and keen understanding it was the Russian who actually brought him in — would only hasten King’s departure. The line that P.J. Carlesimo is the coach and will get the chance to coach is mostly a farce, but it does offer a lot of people the right road to the future: Jackson gets to see what else is out there and methodically evaluate just what the Nets are all about. King gets a stay of execution. The Nets can set themselves up with the right timing to target reported second-choice Jeff Van Gundy, who ESPNNewYork reported this week wants to wait until the offseason to discuss the job. Carlesimo gets another head-coaching chance he probably deserves. It’s true there are several other coaches out there who could be great for Brooklyn, including Van Gundy, Nate McMillan and Mike Dunleavy, and a lot could get in the way for both Jackson and Brooklyn if they wait. A lot can get in the way of this, to be sure. In Los Angeles, Paul could decide he doesn’t want to play for Phil (though he should), mercurial owner Donald Sterling could decide he doesn’t want to share the spotlight with Jackson (both men have big-time egos), and Del Negro could end up cutting his way through a brutal Western Conference playoff picture despite all the indications that’s unlikely. It’s also true in the NBA today — a cutthroat world where coaches can go on the whim of a star or an owner — that the Lakers job could be open as well if that team doesn’t meet equally intense expectations. And yes, an offer around $10 to $12 million a year in a place like New York City presented by an ownership group hell-bent on getting Phil Jackson would be tempting indeed for the pretend-retired head coach. But Zen has its lessons. Like: Ask the right questions, stay in the moment, practice simplicity and see things for what they are. Do that, and Phil Jackson will realize now is the time to take his time, not lunge for the money and adulation Brooklyn can bestow on him. With the Nets so set on getting him, Jackson should be able to leverage even the one thing Prokhorov and his inner circle don’t want to give him: Time.

667,"﻿COMPETITION for a place in the team is bringing the best out of Notts Countys top scorer Yoann Arquin. The Frenchman came off the bench to level for the Magpies with his ﬁrst goal since November. The 24-year-old ﬁ red home from Jamal Campbell-Ryces free-kick to earn his side a point. Walsall had taken the lead through a Will Grigg penalty after County keeper Bartosz Bialkowski clattered Jamie Paterson. Arquins team-mate Alan Judge reckons the arrival of two hotshot youngsters from up the divisions has ﬁ red up the Frenchman. Jacob Blyth arrived this week on-loan from Leicester City and started up front against Walsall. He formed a strike force with Manchester United loanee John Coﬁ e, who made a scoring debut against Crewe last Saturday. Arquin is known to the rest of the County squad as Anelka due to his combination of skill and sulkiness. He has found himself on the bench in recent weeks due to a lack of goals but responded with his eighth of the season at the Banks Stadium. Judge said: Luckily Yoann got a couple of chances and he put one away. Hes seen all the strikers coming into the team and he knows now hes got to start putting the ball into the back of the net. Yoann is a great player, hes just got to get his attitude just right. When it is right as it was today he has come off the bench and he ran them ragged. A draw did not help either sides play-off ambitions but was a fair result. The home side dominated the opening 45 minutes before County got their act together. Judge said: ""We couldnt move the ball in the ﬁrst half but Ill never moan about our pitch again. That pitch was a disgrace. But you have to deal with the conditions and we didnt do that ﬁrst half. In the second half we came out and we went long, we did what they did and it worked. Theres nothing wrong with being more direct. We cant play our passing game all the time, sometimes were overplaying it. "" Grigg also showed his disappointment with Walsall only getting a point. He said: ""It was a tough game, tough conditions but the lads are gutted with the result and I think that shows how far weve come throughout the season. On another day we could have won. We created a few chances in the ﬁrst half and maybe could have snuck it, but second half we didnt get going.""",Raw Data
668,"CRISTIANO Ronaldo last night told his Premier League suitors they will have to wait TWO YEARS to sign him. Manchester United want Ronaldo back at Old Trafford next season, while City are prepared to pay big bucks to bring the winger to the Etihad. But Ronaldo last night dashed their hopes of signing him this summer by insisting he wants to see out his Real Madrid contract, which runs until June 2015. That had been in doubt when he declared he was sad for professional reasons in September, when talks over a new deal first stalled. Ronaldo said: ""I want to see out my contract at Real Madrid. Im very clear about that. After that, well, I dont know whatll happen in the future. Am I happy? Honestly, yes. Im doing something I enjoy. I know how fortunate I am and I feel very fulfilled."" Whatever his long-term plans, Ronaldo will be heading back to Manchester in the near future when his side face United at Old Trafford on March 5. Real Madrid will meet them first at the Bernabeu, though, on February 13 for the first leg of their Champions League glamour tie. Real have not lifted the trophy since 2002, but no-one has won it more often than the nine-time champions  and Ronaldo has warned United to beware. After falling at the last-16 stage for six seasons in a row, Madrid have reached the semi-finals for the last two years under Jose Mourinho and this season they are determined to go all the way, with the final set to take place at Wembley. Ronaldo said: Every Madridista wants that 10th European Cup  were more than aware of that. Last season we fell just short, which was very frustrating. Fortunately we have got the opportunity to set the record straight this year, though the fact we face Manchester United next makes it more difficult. Its not going to be easy and I reckon the odds are about 50-50, but Im still very confident. No team is unbeatable, but when we are at our best, we are a really good side. We know that La Ligas an uphill struggle for us now, but were going to work hard and see what happens. Manchester United have started the English championship race very well and are a long way ahead of the rest, but still, if we play the way were capable of, we can beat them. To do that we need to pull together and play as a team, like we have done in so many matches before.",Raw Data

See which MLB stars earn the highest annual salaries, who's in the $150 million club and who makes the most at each position. The Seattle Mariners continue to talk to Hernandez about an extension, according to major-league sources. And while no deal is close, the Mariners are at least weighing a four-year, $100 million proposal, sources said. It is not known whether the Mariners actually have made Hernandez such an offer; one source described the two sides as “dancing” but not deeply engaged. But a $100 million extension added to the final two years of Hernandez’s current contract would amount to six years, $139.5 million — a starting point for further discussions, and perhaps even a reasonable framework for a deal. Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Zack Greinke recently signed a six-year, $147 million contract as a free agent. Philadelphia Phillies lefty Cole Hamels signed a six-year, $144 million extension last July, when he was just over three months away from hitting the open market. Hernandez, who turns 27 on April 8, is two years away from free agency, which is why the Mariners could attempt to justify offering him less. Then again, he has a career ERA-plus of 127, while Hamels is at 126 and Greinke 114 (ERA-plus is ERA adjusted to a pitcher’s league and ballpark; 100 is considered average). See which countries are represented by MLB's foreign-born players. The biggest problem with a four-year extension for Hernandez is that he probably would want a longer deal. He would be a free agent at 32 if he accepted such an offer, possibly past his prime. Of course, he also might command another big contract at that age, and his career earnings by then would be — ahem — $183.1 million. Viewed from that perspective, Hernandez might prefer immediate security, particularly when he makes no secret of his desire to remain with the Mariners. Again, nothing appears imminent, and both sides are declining comment. But for King Felix’s many fans in Seattle, the talks alone are a positive sign. The Mariners’ three biggest offensive additions — Raul Ibanez, Kendrys Morales and Mike Morse — all are entering their free-agent years. The team could extend one or more of those players, but some rival executives interpret the team’s willingness to take on short-term veterans as an indication that general manager Jack Zduriencik senses an urgency to win now. See which players and managers will work in a new city in 2013. No matter what Zduriencik does, it likely will be difficult for the Mariners to finish better than fourth in the highly competitive AL West. But with other moves likely, the Mariners’ off-season still rates as an incomplete. After trading John Jaso, the M’s still need to add a catcher who will split time with Jesus Montero. They also could use a veteran starting pitcher to replace lefty Jason Vargas. And they could part with one of their many corner-outfield/first-base/DH types to help address their remaining needs. The Mariners know they can’t count on Franklin Gutierrez, who has appeared in only 132 games the past two seasons due to assorted physical problems. So, Morse could be in right, Michael Saunders in center and Raul Ibanez in left, platooning with either Bay or Casper Wells. Justin Smoak could be at first, Morales at DH. Bay or Wells could be one odd man out; Mike Carp could be another. And while there has been talk of trading Smoak, some in the organization still haven’t given up on him, pointing out that he finished with 19 homers after struggling for most of last season and rallying in the final three weeks. As for the next catcher, free agent Kelly Shoppach would appear to be a logical target. Shoppach played for Mariners manager Eric Wedge in Cleveland from 2006 to ’09, and hit 21 homers in 352 at-bats in ’08 when Victor Martinez missed time with an elbow injury. But an official from one of the clubs said Monday, “I can assure you that’s not happening.” Not even with Headley asking for $10.3 million in arbitration and the Padres offering $7.075 million. The Padres eventually figure to move Headley, who is two years away from free agency. But they are in the same division as the Diamondbacks, and the histories of the respective front offices — D-backs GM Kevin Towers previously was with the Padres, and Padres GM Josh Byrnes previously was with the D-backs — might be too much to overcome. Too bad. Headley would give the Diamondbacks at least a two-year solution at third base while the team awaits the arrival of a top prospect, Matt Davidson. The Padres could replace Headley with Jedd Gyorko while welcoming Upton and his career .901 OPS at pitcher-friendly Petco Park. Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? Headley, fifth in the NL MVP balloting, is coming off a far better season than Upton, who was fourth in the 2011 vote. But Upton, signed for three years and $38.5 million, offers an additional year of control and more established track record. Something else to consider: The potential reaction of the Padres’ fan base to a trade of Headley, particularly with the team under new ownership. Headley is homegrown, and the Pads have a history of trading players such as right-hander Jake Peavy and first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. Upton obviously would be a strong return, but the Padres might bristle at the notion of Headley producing even bigger numbers at hitter-friendly Chase Field — not to mention seeing him 18 times a year. The Diamondbacks and Rangers have not revived talks on Upton since the D-Backs’ failed trade with the Mariners, with one source saying that the two sides simply have agreed to “move on.” Follow the latest baseball moves with our transaction tracker. We know now, officially, that the D-Backs want to trade Upton. And we know that the Rangers still are pondering one more significant move. When last these clubs were in contact, the Rangers had made a four-player offer for Upton that included third baseman Mike Olt, according to major-league sources. That offer came before the D-Backs-Mariners agreement, a deal that collapsed when Upton invoked his no-trade rights. A top pitching prospect, either left-hander Martin Perez or righty Cody Buckel, also would have gone to Arizona, along with shortstop Leury Garcia and one other prospect, sources said. (Garcia, 5-foot-7 and 153 pounds, also was part of the Rangers’ discussions for Greinke last summer). Such an offer might lack a prospect with the upside of right-hander Taijuan Walker, the centerpiece of the package that the D-Backs were getting from the Mariners. But it’s not exactly a lowball proposal — and might be better than anything the Atlanta Braves or another club offer. Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates. Without Upton, the Rangers still could plan on free-agent center fielder Michael Bourn — they currently would lose the 24th overall pick as compensation for signing him, but gain the 30th pick for their loss of Josh Hamilton. Another option for the Rangers would be to further strengthen their pitching, either with another late-inning reliever or a veteran starter (free-agent right-hander Kyle Lohse?) on a short-term deal. The Rangers engaged in discussions with the Washington Nationals for right-handed setup man Tyler Clippard earlier this off-season, sources said. One rival exec predicts that the team will end up with one of the remaining big names — Upton, Bourn or Lohse. SPEAKING OF THE NATS . . . The signing of free-agent right-hander Rafael Soriano gives the Nats the flexibility to trade either Clippard or right-hander Drew Storen. Then again, the Nats lack a left-handed specialist, and both Clippard and Storen have good track records against left-handed hitters. See which teams are shelling out the highest MLB payrolls in 2013. Clippard used his changeup to hold left-handed hitters to a .170 batting average and .519 OPS last season. Storen, who did not pitch until July 19 due to a sore right elbow, excelled against lefties in 2011 (.198 BA, .541 OPS), though he was much less effective last season in a smaller sample. One rival executive, mindful of the Nationals’ strong relationship with agent Scott Boras, speculated that the team could sign Lohse and move left-hander Ross Detwiler to the bullpen. Such a possibility cannot be dismissed, but the Nats like the emerging Detwiler as a starter, and his ERA-plus of 117 last season was reasonably close to Lohse’s 134. The more likely move for the Nats would be to sign free-agent righty Javier Vazquez, who would give the team needed rotation depth at a much lower price than Lohse. Few in baseball took note last Oct. 30 when the Chicago Cubs named Vanderbilt pitching coach Derek Johnson their minor-league pitching coordinator. But the move did not escape the attention of one rival executive, who viewed the hiring of Johnson as possibly the first step toward the Cubs landing left-hander David Price. The theory might be a bit of a reach, seeing as how Price is not eligible for free agency until after the 2015 season and coveted by virtually every team in baseball. A lot could happen in the next three years. Specifically, a team such as the Rangers could trade for Price and sign him long-term. The Cubs, though, also could take a similar approach. Ideally, they would prefer to keep their top prospects, then add Price in free agency just as those youngsters were starting to mature. Either way, the hiring of Johnson certainly wouldn’t hinder the Cubs’ pursuit of Price. The two were close at Vanderbilt, and friends say that Price gives Johnson significant credit for his success. Price, the reigning American League Cy Young winner, obviously does not need Johnson’s tutelage at this stage of his career. Still, given their past relationship, Price almost certainly would welcome the chance to work with his former coach again. Chicago also is relatively close to Price’s home in Nashville, and Price is one of those AL pitchers who dreams of playing in the NL and taking his regular turn in a batting order.

670,"MIAMI Chris Bosh will head to Massachusetts for Sunday's game at Boston. One day, he expects to return to the state for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Bosh always has had plenty of confidence. Now, he's talking about how he will be enshrined in Springfield, Mass. ""Hell, yeah, of course. I've been a Hall of Famer like four years ago,"" the Miami Heat center told FOX Sports Florida after Friday's 110-88 win over Detroit. ""And I say that very serious, though. I've talked about it before with my friends."" Bosh has career averages of 19.7 points and 9.0 rebounds. But something happened with the 10-year veteran Thursday that might have clinched his trip to Springfield. Bosh, averaging 17.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, was named to his eighth All-Star Game. The only eligible player in history with eight or more NBA All-Star selections who is not in the Hall is eight-time pick Larry Foust, a center who averaged 13.7 points and 9.8 rebounds from 1950-62. ""With eight, I'm so thankful for that,"" said Bosh, who was intrigued to hear about the above stat. ""It never gets old. Just to be able to have that opportunity to be an All-Star, it's just incredible for me."" But before Bosh is ready to book passage to Springfield, there is a Hall of Famer who said it's premature to say Bosh is a lock to be enshrined. That would be Heat assistant coach Bob McAdoo, who won three scoring titles while playing in the NBA from 1972-86 and then also starred overseas. ""It's hard to say,"" McAdoo said of it being assured Bosh eventually will join him in the Hall. ""You don't know the credentials they're looking for. A lot of times, you never know. It's still too early."" But one guy who is a lock for the Hall of Fame expects to have company in Bosh, in his third season with the Heat after seven in Toronto. ""He's on the right path,"" said Heat guard Dwyane Wade. ""To be in a position where he has a lot of years left, he has a championship under his belt. If we can continue to get more and he can continue to be productive, no question about it."" Bosh turns 29 on March 24. Playing alongside Wade and LeBron James, he's a good bet to reach double figures in career All-Star Games, and certainly could add another ring or two to his finger. ""I don't think this is his last All-Star Game,"" said Heat forward Shane Battier. ""I think CB has got several more up his sleeve. I think that will put him over the top (and into the Hall of Fame)."" Bosh, though, claims he's a lock now. Heck, he figured he was one four years ago when he had just four All-Star Games on his resume.",Raw Data
671,"If it were possible to imagine anything further removed from the uber-glitz of the WTA Womens Tour that is once again beginning its 11 month grind amongst the world's most glamourous cities, then a rainy Friday morning in North Wales would probably be it. The ignorance and apathy of Wrexhams 42000 inhabitants towards their towns $10k professional womens tournament, is tangible. On the other side of the world in Melbourne, Australia, as the stars of the womens game shimmer in the glare of the media white hot spotlight, tennis is the only game in town. A cursory glance around the Welsh border town, shows that this sentiment is not mutual. No posters adorn the sleepy former Steel and Coal town that clings on to its remaining manufacturing heritage like a badge. No buzz about tennis, skitters, helter-skelter within the local conciousness. No Awareness. No inclination. No chance for tennis. If one thing unites these two polar opposites however, it is the fellowship of dedication shared by the respective players who compete. Its 9.45AM here, and the number 1 seed, Briton Naomi Cavaday, has already taken to the court to execute her rigourous pre-match warm up. Amanda Elliott another promising home player, looks on ready, awaiting her 11AM start, whilst partially consumed by the familiarity of her I.Pod. You get the sense that both players feel that their talent is capable of elevating them to greater heights. Heights that will, in another year transport them via 1st class, to the cossetting limo rides, and tournament perks available to the top echelon in Melbourne. That journey will not start today for Elliott. Unsurprisingly she does not have enough to trouble her Opponent, Claudine Schaul. Schaul to her credit, has already experienced the rarefied air at the top of the womens game, as world number 41 in May 2004. She looks the part, and indeed will go on all the way this week, taking the title on Sunday. But again it begs the question as to why this 25 year old, who has won a tournament on the main tour, currently must exist in the twighlight world of the bottom rung of such an arduous ladder. Tennis success is a transient thing, like the factors that drive it: confidence-form-injury, and Cavaday herself should be much higher, the roars from last years packed centre court at wimbledon still ring in the memory, recalling her brave defeat at the hands of Serena Williams. Defeat but not humilliation, indeed Cavaday held the ego-rich American resolutely over the precipice that day, but stood too close herself, and after an inspiring first set lost her equillibrium, and resultantly the close battle. However that was then, and this is now, and Wrexham is nothing like Melbourne in January, but Elliott could make it to Melbourne, Cavaday will make it there one day, and Schaul should make it BACK, but it seems a long way from here to there, as the rain begins to fall in Wrexham.",Raw Data

673,"The final gun has finally sounded on the seemingly endless college football Bowl season. After breathing a quick sigh of relief and going to sleep with thoughts of booth tomfoolery and the dominance of the Alabama running game, fans awoke on Tuesday, January 8th with no football to watch. By the end of Tuesday evening, football fans who were left salty by prime time television options were clamoring for even the worst mismatch. Hopefully, they saved a few games on the DVR for the long offseason. We’re left to a few All-Star games at the collegiate level and the glory of the run to the Super Bowl in terms of live events. However, we can fill our time and get our fill of football by looking ahead to the NFL Draft. Our quest to find the next class of would-be fantasy heroes never ends. Let’s get started at quarterback. Geno Smith was on the board as a Heisman candidate for a brief period this season before things went awry and West Virginia lost five consecutive games. Smith completed 71% of his pass attempts for 4,205 yards with 42 touchdowns and six interceptions. He’ll be the first quarterback off of the board, but where is he bound? Early speculation is that Andy Reid will break the longstanding tradition of drafting a quarterback and bring him to Kansas City. Would that be enough to end the contract stalemate with Dwayne Bowe and keep him in Kansas City? There’s a ton to like about Matt Barkley’s game. He was the presumptive Heisman favorite as he returned to USC with great ceremony and eyes on a national title run. Barkley took advantage of his talented receiving corps to amass 3,273 passing yards with 36 touchdowns and a career-best 8.46 yards per attempt. The biggest knock on Barkley is his propensity to throw the ill-advised pass and try to force the action. He threw 48 interceptions during his USC career. Barkley also missed the team’s Bowl game because of a shoulder injury, so that bears watching leading into the NFL Draft. Barkley projects as a first-round pick and will likely be in a backup position for 2013. Mike Glennon of North Carolina State has the size and arm strength to take the reins in the NFL, but he’s raw. Glennon was a two-year starter for the Wolfpack, putting up 62 touchdowns and 7,085 yards. However, Glennon will need to go to a team with a strong offensive line. He doesn’t move well in the pocket or throw well under duress. Glennon completed only 60.3% of his pass attempts with 29 interceptions while absorbing 67 sacks. Obviously, Tyler Wilson hoped for greater things in his final season at Arkansas. He nearly matched his touchdown total from 2011 (21, down from 24), but the Razorbacks finished a disappointing 4-8, including a 52-0 shutout loss to Alabama. Wilson completed 62.1% of his pass attempts (down for the second straight year) and his interception total nearly doubled (from six to 13). Wilson has the measureables for the next level at 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds. He has the arm strength to make big plays downfield, which also means that he attempts to force passes into tight spots and will commit bad turnovers on occasion. Ryan Nassib was recently added to the Senior Bowl, prompting great enthusiasm in the social media realm. Nassib matched his 2011 completion percentage (62.4%) for Syracuse this season while vastly improving his yardage total (3,749) and establishing a new touchdown mark (26). He has good arm strength and demonstrated the ability to elude pressure and make plays downfield. I’m officially intrigued to see how he performs in the evaluation process. Some early draft boards wonder if a reunion with Doug Marrone in Buffalo is in the offing. Robert Woods and Marqise Lee formed one of the most dominant tandems in the college game this season. Lee returns to USC for one more season before punching his pro ticket. Woods leaves following his second straight double-digit touchdown season. He amassed 2,100 receiving yards on 187 receptions in the past two years. Woods is a tremendous route-runner who gets open. However, he does let the ball get into his body and has been subject to issues with drops. At 6-foot-3, Keenan Allen of the California Bears is likely the first wide receiver to come off the board. Allen has good speed and knows how to use his size. He gets to the spot and fights for the ball. The biggest concern about Allen is the knee injury that forced him to miss his final three games. If his knee clears the medical evaluation, he’ll be the first or second wide receiver off of the board. Fans across the NFL are clamoring for their favorite team to add Cordarrelle Patterson to the receiving corps. The 6-foot-3 junior from Tennessee has great downfield speed and the strength to fend off defenders in traffic. Most importantly, Patterson has good hands and excels as a runner after the catch. He’s a first-round talent and will be an immediate contributor to fantasy lineups. Throw it up and let him fly. DeAndre Hopkins posted a monster season for the Clemson Tigers this season, recording 1,405 yards on 82 receptions with 18 touchdowns. He’s cleaned up some of his technique issues, and there’s no denying his athleticism. Hopkins clocked under a 4.6-second 40-yard dash and has tremendous hands and range. Tavon Austin out of West Virginia is a dangerous triple threat. He excelled as a return man and played both wide receiver and running back. Austin earned finalist slot for the Biletnikoff Award by averaging nearly 10 receptions per game. At 5-foot-9 and 175 pounds, there are questions of where he fits in an offense. Just get the ball in his hands and let him make plays. I suspect he’ll work out of the slot with a cache of gadget plays installed to get him the ball. Tyler Eifert was one of the offensive heroes in Notre Dame’s breakthrough season. Eifert caught 50 passes this season for 685 yards, including four touchdowns. He also snagged six passes for 61 yards in the BCS Championship Game. Eifert produced 113 receptions in his final two seasons at Stanford, including nearly 1,500 receiving yards with nine touchdowns. With teams looking more and more to the tight end, the 6-foot-6 Eifert will hear his name called early in the NFL Draft. Eifert follows in the footsteps of red zone beast Kyle Rudolph of the Vikings. Zach Ertz stepped into the spot vacated by Coby Fleener, producing 69 receptions for nearly 800 yards and six touchdowns. Ertz logged 15 touchdown receptions in three years for the Cardinal. He stands 6-foot-6 and will immediately become part of a red zone package in the NFL. Giovani Bernard posted back-to-back fantastic seasons as a member of the Tar Heels. Bernard topped 1,600 total yards in both seasons while amassing 92 receptions and 31 total touchdowns. Bernard runs with power and hits the hole quickly while driving through contact. His aptitude as a receiver puts him over the top, making him potentially a three-down option. Lost in the hype surrounding the broadcast booth and talk of a dynasty in Alabama was the fact that Eddie Lacy ran roughshod over Notre Dame. Lacy ran for 140 yards on 20 carries with two touchdowns in the blowout win. He averaged 6.5 yards per carry during the regular season with 17 touchdown runs. As demonstrated in the title game, Lacy exhibits great patience and keeps moving while breaking tackles (you can search for the snapshots). Andre Ellington is a fantastic speed option out of Clemson. He earned his second straight 1,000-yard season in 2012, producing 5.1 yards per carry with eight touchdowns. Ellington has a great burst to the outside, but he struggles at the point of contact. Ellington may serve as a change-of-pace back for 2013. Montee Ball scores touchdowns. That’s the part of the stat line that everyone will remember from Ball’s career in Madison (83 total). He excelled behind a huge offensive line while toting the ball a ton (663 in the past two seasons). Ball demonstrated the ability to catch the ball out of the backfield as a junior with 24 receptions, but wasn’t called on to do so in 2012. Ball attacks the line of scrimmage and earns yardage after contact. Joseph Randle produced another fantastic season for the Cowboys, gaining over 1,600 total yards with 14 touchdowns, a tremendous follow-up to his 2011 season. Randle has been an effective receiver out of the backfield, generating 98 receptions over three seasons. Randle has a great first step and can keep his feet after contact. Finally, most college football fans cringe when they hear the name Marcus Lattimore. Lattimore, as you remember, sustained extensive damage to his right ACL and LCL in an October game. The South Carolina tailback announced that he would enter the 2013 NFL Draft and stated a personal goal of jogging and catching passes by the end of March. Could he possibly put together a return to action in an Adrian Peterson fashion? I’ll be curious to watch Lattimore’s progress as the NFL Draft approaches in April.",Raw Data

675,"Trey McKinney Jones scored 15 points Sunday to help the ACC leaders win their seventh game in a row by beating archrival Florida State, 71-47. The postgame celebration was more subdued than when No. 25-ranked Miami drubbed No. 1 Duke on Wednesday, but the capacity crowd of 7,972 was hardly ho-hum. ''The Duke game was the best all year as far as atmosphere, but this was a big-time game for us,'' center Reggie Johnson said. ''The fans really kept us going, and we're proud of that.'' The Hurricanes (15-3, 6-0) are assured of a significant jump in Monday's poll. ''They played like a mature team that understands what it takes to grind it out,'' Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said. ''They could do great things this year.'' The Seminoles (11-8, 3-3) fell to 0-3 this season against ranked teams. Miami, meanwhile, is off to its best start in the conference, alone atop the standings, and improved to 9-0 at home. ''I'm not very surprised,'' center Kenny Kadji said. ''We have a great team, and we have great chemistry.'' Miami cracked the rankings for the first time in three years Monday and is creating a buzz even in South Florida, where college basketball tends to draw little attention. The sellout was only the 11th in the Hurricanes' 10-year-old on-campus arena, but their second in a row. ''We feel good, man,'' Johnson said. ''The team is playing at a high level right now. We've got to enjoy this, but we've got to stay focused.'' Defense was the difference against the Seminoles, who endured repeated long scoring droughts. The Seminoles shot a season-low 31 percent, the fourth time in the past five games they've been under 42 percent. Florida State's starters went 7 for 26 and totaled 19 points. Miami has not allowed an opponent to shoot better than 50 percent this season. McKinney Jones had three 3-pointers for the Hurricanes. Kadji and Durand Scott scored 11 points apiece, and Shane Larkin had eight points, nine rebounds and six assists. ''We played very well,'' coach Jim Larranaga said. ''We had only three guys in double figures, but we had 19 assists. That's good sharing of the ball.'' The Hurricanes also had a 44-32 rebounding edge against the taller Seminoles and outscored them 15-2 on second-chance points. Reserve Ian Miller had 12 points for the young Seminoles, who went 3 for 17 from 3-point range. ''We're good shooters. I watch them every day,'' Hamilton said. ''If we had a shooting contest in the gym and lined up and played H-O-R-S-E, we'd be OK. But the game is not a H-O-R-S-E game. You've got to execute your offense and have someone deliver the ball and get you in good positions, and right now we're not quite as consistent with that as I think we will be.'' Florida State scoring leader Michael Snaer went 2 for 5 and was held to four points, 10.5 below his average. ''Michael struggles because we struggle,'' Hamilton said. ''If our team executed a lot better, then it would be a lot easier on him.'' Miami scored the first six points and led all the way. After Florida State cut the deficit to two late in the first half, McKinney Jones converted back-to-back fast breaks, scoring on a layup and then sinking a pull-up 3-pointer for a 37-26 lead. Three-pointers by McKinney Jones, Larkin and Scott helped the Hurricanes build the margin to 54-33. ''We knew FSU was a good defensive team, and we had to share the ball and be unselfish,'' Kadji said.",Raw Data

677,"﻿ His second-place finish in last year’s running of the Great American Race launched the driver’s best attempt at a title run in eight seasons. And this year’s running of the Daytona 500 — Feb. 24, noon ET on FOX — will set the tone for Junior’s 2013 campaign. “I’m really excited and look forward to sort of getting back to that older style of (restrictor) plate racing and I think it will provide a really good Daytona 500."" Wonder what kind of season Junior will have? You're not alone. Here are a few clues: It’s All About the Relationships ... For the last two seasons, Earnhardt has built a solid foundation with the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports team and crew chief Steve Letarte. The relationships go well beyond the track. Last week at Earnhardt’s Whisky River nightclub in Charlotte, he and teammate Jimmie Johnson held a kickoff party for the Nos. 48 and 88 shop to jumpstart the season. Letarte says his relationship with Junior is just “natural.” Letarte’s wife Tricia and Earnhardt’s girlfriend of four years Amy Reimann tease the pair about their man crush. And while Letarte gets a lot of credit for inspiring Earnhardt and the team, he insists that it’s the driver who has adopted the leadership role. “For 72 races now, he hasn’t changed one bit,” Letarte said. “He’s been on time or early for every race with a smile and ready to go. At the end of the race, he’s ready to get back in the car on Monday. I appreciate his enthusiasm because it is leading by example. And I believe it’s 100 percent genuine enthusiasm. “I get a lot of credit for this big motivational this and that, but he motivates me. His enthusiasm tops me a lot of days. Everybody needs somebody to push them and he’s the guy that pushes me to do the best at my job. Hopefully, I can do the best for him.” For the first time since Dale Earnhardt Jr. made his NASCAR debut in 1996, he’s entering the season with available advertising real estate on his Chevy. Yes, NASCAR’s Most Popular Driver is 15 races short of full sponsorship. How is this possible? After two seasons without a win and a six-year absence from atop the point standings, Earnhardt had a comeback year — and he’s just getting started. “You have to find the right guy that’s interested in something that size and is willing to fit the price range you want as a team,” Earnhardt said. “You can’t undersell compared to what you’re working with on the other races and the contracts you have in place. Everything has to align itself and there’s other opportunities out there.” It's a new generation … It’s really too early for any of the drivers to have a concrete idea of how the Generation 6 car will handle over the long haul. But for drivers such as Junior whose performance suffered throughout the Car of Tomorrow Generation — he posted just two wins in six seasons — it’s a welcomed reprieve. “I like this car a whole lot more than the COT,” Earnhardt said with a smile. “The car is going to provide a better race car for us and give us a better product.” Earnhardt, who dreaded testing in the past, couldn’t wait to arrive in Daytona for Pre-Season Thunder. Ditto the shakedown of the Gen-6 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. While he believes “it’s going to take some time to really understand where it all fits and how it fits” him, obviously, the COT “was not a very good fit” for Earnhardt. “I struggled with the (COT) car and you couldn’t overdrive the car at all, even half a car length into the corner and it would get pissed off at you,” Earnhardt said of the COT's handling characteristics. “This car we have today still has a splitter, but I think the rest of the car is definitely a step back toward the old, original car we used to have. I think that’s going to benefit me in certain areas and in other areas, I’ll still have to learn. There will be new things about this car. New things it does that you’ll have to tailor yourself to and understand. “I’m certain that I’ll have to have an open mind towards a lot of things about the car that I might not fall in love with, but as a whole the car is really exciting. I’m looking forward to it.” Will 2013 Finally Be The Year Junior Wins It All? From the moment Earnhardt made his Nationwide Series debut at Myrtle Beach Speedway in 1996, he’s been scrutinized as the son of seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt. There were few coming-out parties in the Cup Series as heralded as the 25-year-old’s in 2000, particularly after dominating the NNS with back-to-back championships. Even the driver admits he felt “the sky was the limit.” The lofty expectations weighed on the rookie as evidenced by consecutive wrecks at Darlington and Bristol. Then at Texas, in the seventh race — his 12th career Cup start — Earnhardt earned his first of two victories that year. Despite losing his father the following year in the Daytona 500, Junior amassed 16 wins before he turned 30. Although the next six seasons would be difficult as he left Dale Earnhardt Inc. and transitioned into Hendrick Motorsports, Earnhardt never doubted his own natural talent. Even during the darkest times, he believed a championship was in him. “I never thought to myself, ‘well, me as a driver, I’m just not cut out to be a champion, I don’t have what it takes.’ I never felt that way,” Earnhardt said. “I just knew that it takes so many variables to come together. It takes everything working the right way. “‘Are the opportunities ahead of me that I’ve had in the past?’ I wasn’t entirely confident about that part. It felt like we were so far away from where we needed to be. Then Rick made all these changes and things started looking up. I enjoyed who I was working with in regards to Steve and the team.” But as Earnhardt reiterated his sentiment from one year ago, the team must continue to progress and cannot afford to “flat line.” Accepting a top 10 position in the point standings will guarantee the No. 88 crew a berth in the Chase to the Sprint Cup — it takes much more to win the title. “We have to be a top-five team,” Earnhardt said. “We have to do things better — and we did that last year. We were in the points lead a couple of times and in the conversation about the Chase as one of the teams to look at as far as a contender. I’d never been that as many years as I can remember.” Under the direction of Letarte, the No. 88 crew never wavered through the first 26 races in spite of a concussion sustained during a testing accident on Aug. 29 before Atlanta. Earnhardt assumed the points lead at the end of July for the first time since October 2004 and he never dropped lower than fifth in the standings. But it was the lack of wins that tanked the team to seventh place once the points from his sole Michigan win were recalculated to reflect his position in the standings. Earnhardt says the team was “disappointed” with the lack of wins and must “look at ourselves as a team that’s capable of winning multiple races.” “We have to maintain that consistency that we had last year,” Earnhardt said. ""When you get to Pocono — just like we did in the middle of last summer — you start to look at your situation and say, ‘Hmm, we’re a contender,’ that’s what I felt like last year. I hope that we’ll feel the same way when we get to the summer this year.” The Show Must Go On — But For How Much Longer? Earnhardt signed a five-year extension in the summer of 2011 that goes into effect this season and will expire when the driver is 42. While Earnhardt has always been extremely open in his relationship with the media, recently the driver has become more reflective. Certainly, when Earnhardt was sidelined last fall due to a concussion, he had plenty of time to think. Earnhardt acknowledges that he took racing for granted in his younger years. There would always be cars to drive and races to run. But with every season that has passed since his father was killed in the 2001 Daytona 500, particularly the ones of late when the driver would have given anything to win, Earnhardt has realized just how precious — and fleeting — his opportunity has been. “When you were young, it was cool to go to the Daytona 500 but you knew you were going to be at the next one and the next one and the next one,” Earnhardt said. “Eventually you get to a point where you can count how many you’ve got left on both hands and you start to take things a lot more seriously and involve yourself into the experience a lot more. “But that’s a direct result of the way we’ve been running. When you run well, you definitely enjoy it and want to do it and be around it and think about the next 10 years. If they’re like this, it will be great.”",Raw Data

680,"Colin Kaepernick and Frank Gore led San Francisco to a record comeback in the NFC championship game Sunday, overcoming an early 17-0 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons 28-24 and send the 49ers to their first Super Bowl since 1995. Gore scored a pair of touchdowns, including the winner with 8:23 remaining for San Francisco's first lead of the day, and the 49ers defense made it stand up. A fourth-down stop at the 10-yard line denied Atlanta another stirring comeback after blowing a big lead. ''Everybody does a little,'' 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh said, ''and it adds up to be a lot.'' San Francisco (13-4-1) moves on to face Baltimore at New Orleans in two weeks, looking to join Pittsburgh as the only franchises with six Super Bowl titles. It'll be a brother-vs.-brother matchup, too, since John Harbaugh coaches the Ravens. Joe Montana led the 49ers to four Super Bowl wins and Steve Young took them to No. 5. It's up to Kaepernick and Co. to get No. 6. ''He just competes like a maniac all the time,'' said Harbaugh, whose much-debated decision to bench Alex Smith at midseason now looks like the best move of the year. Harbaugh was hoppin' mad when a disputed call went against the 49ers on Atlanta's potential winning drive. He leaped in the air, screamed at the officials and had to be restrained by his staff from charging the field. No complaints when it was over. ''We rose up there at the end,'' Harbaugh said. His second-year quarterback, who runs like a track star, didn't get a chance to show off his touchdown celebration - flexing his right arm and kissing his bicep, a move that quickly became a social media sensation known as Kaepernicking. But he shredded the Falcons through the air by completing 16 of 21 for 233 yards, including a 4-yard touchdown to Vernon Davis, and had them so worried about his running ability out of the spread option that Gore and LaMichael James had plenty of room. Gore scored a pair of touchdowns, including the game winner with 8:23 remaining for San Francisco's first lead of the day. Davis scored the first TD for the 49ers on a 15-yard run. ''I take my hat off to Atlanta. They played hard. They've got a great team,'' Gore said. ''But we fought, man. We fought and we deserved it.'' The 49ers pulled off the biggest comeback victory in an NFC championship game, according to STATS. The previous NFC record was 13 points - Atlanta's victory over Minnesota in the 1999 title game, which sent the Falcons to what remains the only Super Bowl in franchise history. The AFC championship game record is 18 points, when Indianapolis rallied past New England in 2007. Harbaugh is hardly cool and collected like the 49ers' first Super Bowl-winning coach, Bill Walsh, but has pulled off a similar turnaround in San Francisco. The 49ers had eight straight years without a winning record before their new coach arrived from Stanford in 2011. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. He immediately led San Francisco to the cusp of the Super Bowl, losing to the eventual champion New York Giants in overtime in last year's NFC title game, a bitter defeat at home set up by a fumbled return. This time, the 49ers were the ones winning on the road to set up another celebration in the city by the bay, which is rapidly becoming the new Titletown USA. They'll try to follow the lead of the baseball Giants, who won the World Series in October. ''We've come full circle,'' said Denise DeBartolo York, part of the family that has owned the 49ers since their championship days, ''and the dynasty will prevail.'' Kaepernick guided San Francisco on a pair of second-half scoring drives that wiped out Atlanta's 24-14 lead at the break. Gore scored on a 5-yard run early in the third quarter, then sprinted in from 9 yards out for the winning score with 8:23 remaining after each team made crucial mistakes to ruin potential scoring drives. On both of Gore's TDs, the Falcons had to worry about Kaepernick running it in himself. They barely even touched the running back on either play, and James scored pretty much the same way. ''I kind of figured that coming in and they showed that on film, so I assumed Frank and LaMichael were going to have a big day,'' Kaepernick said. ''Frank ran hard today, and I can't say enough about him.'' The top-seeded Falcons (14-4), in what appeared to be the final game for Hall of Famer-to-be Tony Gonzalez, tried to pull off another season-extending drive. But, unlike the week before against Seattle, they needed a touchdown this time. They came up 10 yards short. On fourth down, Matt Ryan attempted a pass over the middle to Roddy White that would have been enough to keep the drive going. But linebacker NaVorro Bowman stuck a hand in to knock it away with 1:13 remaining. The 49ers ran off all but the final 6 seconds, not nearly enough time for Ryan to pull off his greatest comeback yet. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons blew a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter, the Seahawks scoring the go-ahead touchdown with 31 seconds remaining. But Ryan completed two long passes, setting up Matt Bryant's 49-yard field goal for 30-28 victory. The Falcons came up short of their second Super Bowl, leaving the 1995 Braves as the city's only major sports champions. This one figures to hurt for a while. ''We didn't make the plays when we had the opportunity,'' Falcons coach Mike Smith said. ''There were five or six plays, like in most hard-fought games, that make a difference. There were ebbs and flows and changes in momentum, and they made more plays than we did.'' Kaepernick, who ran for 181 yards against the Packers the week before to set an NFL playoff record for a quarterback, didn't have much chance to use his legs against the Falcons. He broke off a 23-yard gain, but was thrown for a 2-yard loss the only other time he carried the ball. But Kaepernick showed he's more than a runner. His favorite receiver was Davis, who hauled in five passes for 106 yards. Gore carried 21 times for 90 yards, while James added 34 yards on five carries. Ryan finished 30 of 42 for 396 yards, by far the best performance of his playoff career. But his postseason record dropped to 1-4, done in by two big miscues - an interception and a fumble - in the second half. Julio Jones was Ryan's leading target most of the day, finishing with 11 catches for 182 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He hauled in a 46-yarder less than 4 minutes into the game, then made a dazzling grab in the left corner of the end zone for a 20-yard score. He got his left foot down, then planted his right foot about an inch inside the line - while cornerback Tarell Brown was all over him. Ryan threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Gonzalez with 25 seconds remaining in the first half after the 49ers had cut the deficit to 17-14. It seemed the home team had reclaimed the momentum heading to the locker room, but, amazingly, that would be its final score of the day. The 49ers quickly seized control on the opening possession of the second half, driving 82 yards in just seven plays for Gore's first TD. After a nearly perfect first half, in which Ryan was 18 of 24 for 271 yards and those three TDs, the quarterback known as Matty Ice made a couple of crucial blunders. First, he tossed a pass that was picked off by Chris Culliver, halting a drive in 49ers territory. Ryan ripped off his chinstrap in disgust. Then, with the Falcons in scoring range for at least a field goal, Ryan failed to grab a shotgun snap, appearing to take his eyes off the ball before he caught it. The ball squirted away and Aldon Smith recovered for the 49ers at their own 37. ''Against a good team, you can't have those kind of mistakes,'' Ryan said. San Francisco also squandered some chances. Struggling kicker David Akers clanked a 38-yard field goal try off the upright, and Michael Crabtree fumbled just short of the goal line, the ball stripped away by Dunta Robinson and recovered by Stephen Nicholas. But, after that big defensive stop with 13 1-2 minutes remaining, the Falcons went three-and-out. Atlanta took the ensuing kickoff and used up nearly all the clock while going 70 yards. The Falcons might have reclaimed the lead if Harry Douglas had been able to stay on his feet while hauling in a 22-yard pass. The defender slipped, and so did Douglas, but he held on to the ball. Harbaugh thought it touched the turf and challenged the call, then launched into his tirade when the officials let it stand. It all worked out, though. As for the 36-year-old Gonzalez, who said all year he was all but certain this would be his final season, it sure sounded like the end. ''I've had such a great life,'' he said. ''I wish it would've culminated with the Super Bowl, but it didn't.''",Raw Data

684,"'World Cup - FIFA approves goal-line technology for 2014' on Yahoo! Eurosport UK. FIFA has approved the use of goal-line technology for the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. Two systems, Hawkeye and Goalref, have so far been licensed by FIFA and both were used at last year's Club World Cup in Japan, one in each of the two stadiums, where goal-line technology was employed for the first time. FIFA said a third system, developed in Germany, had already passed examinations and that the providers were in licensing discussions. A fourth system, also German, has also been tested with the results due this week. FIFA confirmed goal-line technology was ""successful"" at the Club World Cup, although there were no incidents where it had to be used. It intends to install goal-line technology at all 12 venues at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""After a successful implementation of goal-line technology (GLT) at the Club World Cup in Japan in December 2012, FIFA has decided to use GLT at the Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 and 2014 World Cup,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""The aim is to use GLT in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia, pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests. ""With different technologies on the market, FIFA has launched a tender today, setting out the technical requirements for the two forthcoming competitions in Brazil."" FIFA said Hawkeye and Goalref would have to join the selection process. Goal-line technology providers had been invited to join an inspection visit to the six Confederations Cup venues in March. Those venues will all be staging matches at the following year's World Cup. The use of goal-line technology, to help match officials in cases where it is not immediately clear if the ball has entered the goal, was approved by football's rule-making body, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), last year. The use of goal-line technology had previously been rejected by FIFA, which performed a U-turn following the controversy over Frank Lampard's disallowed goal for England in the 2010 World Cup match against Germany. Replays clearly showed that the ball had crossed the line after bouncing down off the underside of the crossbar, but match officials did not award the goal. Germany, 2-1 ahead at the time, went on to win 4-1. However, goal-line technology is not favoured by UEFA, which instead prefers to employ two extra linesmen, one on each goal line. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has already said that extra linesmen are unlikely to be used at the World Cup. Many critics think that football should go further and allow the use of video replays to help referees make decisions concerning offside, handball and fouls. Referees have to make split second judgments with the naked eye while millions of television viewers are treated to slow-motion replays, from different angles, which often show clearly whether the official was right or wrong.",Raw Data
685,"The United States team, including Olympic 100-meter hurdler Lolo Jones, won gold Sunday in the combined bobsled-skeleton team event at the world championships. American hurdler Lolo Jones became famous to the masses when she revealed she was a virgin. Find out more about her. Jones was brakewoman for Elana Meyers in the women's bobsled portion of an event that also added times in two-man bobsled plus men's and women's skeleton. The U.S. edged Germany by 0.24 seconds even though the Germans won three of four disciplines on the Olympia track. Jones added her first gold medal in her new sport to her two world titles in the indoor 60-meter hurdles, in 2008 and '10. The winning U.S. team included two-man bobsled pilot Steven Holcomb, who earlier Sunday lost his title in his main event to the youngest world champion in history. At 22 years, 270 days, Francesco Friedrich of Germany broke a record set in 1935 by Swiss driver Reto Capadrutt, according to bobsled's world governing body. Holcomb placed fourth. Skeleton racer Noelle Pikus-Pace was 1.7 seconds faster than German rival Marion Thees to lead the U.S. to victory. Canada took bronze, 1.01 seconds behind the Americans' overall time of 4 minutes, 31.29 seconds. Meyers and Jones were the third-fastest in women's bobsled; Holcomb and Curtis Tomasevicz were third in two-man bobsled; and John Daly was seventh-fastest in men's skeleton. After leading the two-day, two-man bobsled competition throughout, Friedrich became the first man to win senior and junior world titles in the same season. Friedrich and brakeman Jannis Baecker were 0.56 seconds faster than silver medalists Beat Hefti and Thomas Lamparter of Switzerland. Friedrich drove to a combined four-run time of 4 minutes, 22.78 seconds. German bronze medalists Thomas Florschuetz and Andreas Bredau trailed Friedrich by 1.19. Holcomb and Steven Langton finished fourth, 0.08 off the podium, after being third in the opening two runs Saturday.",Raw Data
686,"Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers really think they're on to something, even if it's nothing revolutionary. They're gaining confidence in their newfound attitude and approach with each victory they're producing. Not even a fantastic fourth-quarter rally by the New Orleans Hornets could shake Kobe's conviction that the Lakers have finally figured out a few things about their puzzling season. Dwight Howard scored 24 points, Bryant had 14 points and 11 assists in another pass-first performance, and the Lakers hung on to beat New Orleans 111-106 Tuesday night for their first three-game winning streak in five weeks. Earl Clark had 20 points and 12 rebounds for the Lakers (20-25), who jumped to an 18-point lead midway through the fourth quarter with their third straight game of patient passing and hard-nosed defense quarterbacked by Bryant. The fifth-leading scorer in NBA history has warmly embraced his new role as a playmaker - no surprise for somebody whose first basketball muse was Magic Johnson. ''It's working pretty well,'' said Bryant, whose 39 assists in the Lakers' last three games are the biggest three-game total of his 17-season career. ''It's very easy for me to look over the defense and know where they're coming from, just kind of line my guys up in the right way and just pick them apart.'' With Bryant running the show, the Lakers even survived a frenetic finish. Their lead dwindled to 102-101 with 2 minutes left shortly after an electric 16-2 run in a 2 1/2 minute stretch by the Hornets, but Clark hit a layup and Steve Nash calmly buried a 3-pointer with 1:21 left to clinch Los Angeles' ninth straight win over New Orleans. Nash had 12 points and five assists, while Antawn Jamison scored 16 points. Four-time All-Star Pau Gasol had seven points, seven rebounds and seven assists as a reserve in the Lakers' final home game before a seven-game trip, their longest of the season, while the Grammy Awards take over Staples Center. The trip should be daunting for the Lakers, who have lost 15 of 20 on the road this season, including seven straight since Christmas. Instead, they're optimistic about trying out their new approach in a hostile environment. ''We're doing a good job of not being selfish, and of doing whatever we can to help our team win,'' Howard said. ''Things are clicking for us. Our offense is a lot smoother, and on defense we're really holding each other accountable.'' Sounds simple - but the Lakers have rarely looked this good in their complex season. Eric Gordon scored 18 of his 25 points in the first half for the Hornets, who got within one point on Greivis Vasquez's running jumper. Ryan Anderson scored 11 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter for the Hornets, who had won eight of 12, including an impressive victory in Memphis two nights earlier at the start of their five-game trip. Anderson, Vasquez and Robin Lopez led the impressive late rally that just fell short, with Lopez finishing with 16 points and nine rebounds. ''We're a young team that's still building chemistry, and to come back like that is a really good confidence boost for the guys,'' said Gordon, a Staples Center favorite in his career with the Clippers. ''We had a chance to win. We were getting a lot of stops and were scoring at will. It just boiled down to the final plays.'' Rookie Anthony Davis had 18 points for the Hornets, who haven't beaten the Lakers at Staples Center since January 2009. Bryant reached new statistical heights in his revamped role, racking up 10 assists in three straight games for just the fifth time in his career and the first time in four years. Bryant also had eight rebounds, falling just short of a triple-double for the third straight game. Two days after beating Oklahoma City in impressive fashion, the Lakers got right back to their improved form in the first half, holding the Hornets scoreless for 7:41 spanning the first two quarters with a 17-0 run. ''Even though we were down 18, we should have won the game,'' Vasquez said. ''It's hard losing like that, but I thought we battled. We just can't get down by 18. We can't allow us to do that to ourselves. We've got to bring the juice from the beginning. We're good enough to beat anybody if we just play with energy. If we don't play with energy, it's going to be a long night.'' Notes: The Hornets' brutal road trip began in Tennessee and will eventually take them to Minnesota for their fourth game in five nights on Saturday. They'll be at Utah on Wednesday night. ... Steve Blake had two points and four assists in the veteran guard's first appearance for the Lakers since Nov. 11. He had missed the Lakers' past 37 games with an abdominal injury that required surgery and resulting groin problems. ... The Lakers missed four free throws in less than 1 second of clock time midway through the third quarter. After Howard missed two, Gasol grabbed the rebound and got fouled without the clock moving - but Gasol then missed two as well. Clark collected that rebound, but threw it past Bryant for a backcourt violation.",Raw Data
687,"The New York Rangers’ home opener got off to an ominous start before the puck ever dropped Sunday night at Madison Square Garden, when Daniel Rodriguez took the ice to perform the national anthem in place of legendary anthem singer John Amirante, a fixture at Rangers games for more than three decades. When Rodriguez emerged from the Zamboni tunnel, the Blueshirts faithful booed him loudly — simply, it seemed, for not being the 77-year-old Amirante, who missed the game due to illness — and it didn’t take long for those boos to shift toward the home bench in a 6-3 loss that was effectively over after two periods. We get after everything you need to know on every division, every team. The defeat dropped the Rangers, the presumptive Eastern Conference favorites, to 0-2 on the lockout-delayed campaign, and ordinarily, that wouldn’t be cause for concern. After all, New York needed four games to get in the win column last season and ended up handily securing the No. 1 seed in the East with 109 regular-season points. But with a 48-game season leaving teams racing to push their point total to the mid-to-upper 50s to secure a playoff spot and the margin for error being so much thinner, every game takes on an elevated level of importance. That wasn’t lost on the New York players, who expressed concern, but perhaps not dismay, after the game. “There’s only 48 games, so every game means a little bit more,” said Rangers captain Ryan Callahan, who scored his first goal of the season to knot the game at 1-1 with 10:05 left in the first period. “This isn’t the start we wanted to get off to, but by no means — there’s no panic in here. We know the group we have in here, we know there’s things we need to fix and correct, and I feel like we can do that.” The Rangers’ home opener began to unravel early against a tough Pittsburgh squad that looks every bit like a Stanley Cup contender after a 2-0-0 start that also includes a win over the Philadelphia Flyers. New York’s Arron Asham and Pittsburgh’s Tanner Glass started the game off with a fight two seconds into the first period, and a Brad Richards interference penalty gave the Pens a man advantage 35 seconds later. Pittsburgh capitalized on the power play and took a 1-0 lead just 1:48 into the game on a goal from James Neal, the first of two on the night for the Penguins’ second-leading point man from last season. After Callahan scored on a 5-on-3 advantage for the Rangers, Pittsburgh added two more first-period goals, one each from Tyler Kennedy and defenseman Matt Niskanen, to take a 3-1 lead into the first intermission. Pascal Dupuis beat Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist stick side off a pass from Evgeni Malkin to make the score 4-1 with 10:49 left in the second period, prompting Rangers coach John Tortorella to pull Lundqvist for backup Martin Biron. “I was not going to keep him in there,” Tortorella said afterward when asked why he pulled the 2012 Vezina Trophy winner. “It wasn’t him; I was not going to keep him in there with what was going on in front of him.” Neal’s second goal of the season gave Pittsburgh a 5-1 lead before newcomers Taylor Pyatt and Rick Nash each scored their first goals as Rangers in the third. But a sloppy Callahan turnover led directly to an empty-net goal for Kris Letang, spoiling the New York comeback effort and the home debut for Nash, who is finally playing for a good team in a good market after spending nine years in Columbus with the Blue Jackets. “I’d rather have the two points,” Nash said afterward when asked about his first Rangers score. “It doesn’t mean much. If it helped us win or helped us tie, then it would mean a lot, but I’d rather have the two points than the goal.” The 0-2-0 start isn't exactly disastrous for New York — after all, the Flyers have also lost their first two games of the season, and no one is counting them out, either. But the fact that both losses came in litmus test-type games against contending Eastern Conference foes is, at the very least, troubling. Last year, it took the Rangers almost a month to figure things out after a 3-3-3 start that included seven consecutive road games to begin the season, but they don't have that luxury this time around. With less than 60 percent of the usual schedule to work with, every injury has the potential to be that much more devastating, every kink needs to be worked out that much quicker and every loss means that much more. “The only good thing is we’re only four points out of first in the division,” Richards said. “But it’s going to come quick, and you can’t let it snowball. You don’t want to do that anyway in an 82-game season, but with only 46 games left, it’s got to be corrected quickly. But I don’t think there’s anything out there that we can’t correct. It’s pretty much all plain and simple; it’s just up to us if we want to buy into it. We can all do it, it’s just when we decide to do it.” If the Rangers are to turn things around — and, really, there’s no reason to think they can’t; it’s still only two games we’re talking about — there are a few things they’ll need to improve upon, and they’ll need to do so quickly. They need to protect their goalie better and give him a chance, for one, and they must start getting the puck out of their own end. Pittsburgh maintained control for most of Sunday’s game, and there was little New York could do about it. The Rangers also have to stay out of the penalty box, especially early — in Saturday’s 3-1 loss to Boston, Carl Hagelin put himself in the pen for two minutes with an interference penalty 19 seconds in. And when they do have to serve time, the penalty kill needs to be more consistent. After nixing all seven Bruins power plays, New York allowed Pittsburgh to score two power play goals and also gave up another in a 4-on-4 situation. “The effort and the execution weren’t there,” defenseman Marc Staal said. “The little passes, the details that get us out of our zone quickly weren’t there. We were just a little disjointed and it took us a while to get the puck back, and when we did, we were too tired to make any plays with it.” New York could also benefit from a little more toughness. After the Asham-Glass fight to start the game, the Rangers allowed the Pens to bully them for most of the night, and Brooks Orpik put an exclamation mark on that point with a brutal, clean hit on Chris Kreider at the Rangers’ blue line with 38.4 seconds left in the rout. “That’s a big problem with the club right now,” Tortorella said of the hit on Kreider. “Maybe we need to get whacked around a little bit more to wake us up.” Of course, this one game, and that one hit, are no more a sign that the Rangers aren’t tough than two losses are a sign that New York isn’t the Stanley Cup contender we expected. But both situations need to be rectified sooner than later, or else this four-month race to the playoffs could prove more difficult than the Rangers ever anticipated. “I think we got away a little bit from the way we were playing last year — the hard-nosed style, in your face,” Callahan said. “I think it starts with that and it trickles from there into our systems. Obviously, we expected our systems not to be perfect from the start, but at the same time, they need to be better than they are.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data

As a female race car driver, Patrick has been fortunate to be not only a trailblazer, but due to her marketability the 30-year-old driver has been fortunate to have the best equipment in both the NASCAR and IndyCar Series. She was the first female to win a race in IndyCar. She won the first pole for a female driver in the Nationwide Series at Daytona last February and posted the first top-five finish in any of NASCAR’s top touring divisions with her fourth-place finish at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 2011. Sunday was no exception. With a lap of 196.434 mph, Patrick drove her No. 10 GoDaddy.com Chevy SS to the pole position for the Feb. 24 Daytona 500 (Noon ET on FOX). Still, as Patrick says, she “was brought up to be the fastest driver, not the fastest girl.” “That was instilled in me from very young, from the beginning,” Patrick said. “Then I feel like thriving in those moments where the pressure's on has also been a help for me. I also feel like I've been lucky in my career to be with good teams and have good people around me. I don't think any of it would have been possible without that. DANICA'S BEST There's no one like Danica, both on and off the track. Check out some of our favorite photos of Danica in action . “For those reasons, I've been lucky enough to make history, be the first woman to do many things. I really just hope that I don't stop doing that. We have a lot more history to make. We are excited to do it.” Most of her fellow competitors share her sentiment. Once the helmet goes on, there’s no distinction between genders or races. “For me it's not about the color of your skin or your gender, it's about your abilities,” said Jeff Gordon , who will share the front row with Patrick. “You have to prove that. I think Danica's a talented race car driver. She proved that by getting herself into IndyCar, doing what she did in IndyCar. She has taken on quite a task to take on stockcars that are completely foreign to her. I kind of admire somebody that's willing to take that leap. “No different than the way I look at Sam Hornish, Juan Pablo Montoya, any of the guys that have been driving open wheel cars most of their career and then get in a stock car. It's completely different. But I love people that are willing to take chances and challenge themselves. That's more of the way that I look at Danica, not just accepting a female.” Jimmie Johnson was the last rookie to win the pole for the Daytona 500 when he posted the fastest lap in 2002. The five-time champion feels Patrick’s achievement is “a great milestone for the sport.” “It’s great for her and a great kick-start to the year for everyone within NASCAR,” Johnson said. SUPER STAR Danica may be relatively new to NASCAR, but she's found success for years. Kasey Kahne believes having Patrick on the pole is “a big deal” for both the driver and the team. Kahne also believes the opportunity to start from the front row will be a tremendous boost of confidence for the rookie. “She’s got a fast car,” Kahne said. “She’s got great teammates. She can feel really good about her chances in the race to have a good run. She’s got a good engine package — cause I know all about that. We have the same one. “You’ve got to give her credit (for) how far she’s come in her career to where she is today. Today is all about the race car and the ability to get around the track.” NASCAR defending champion Brad Keselowski was more cautious than his fellow drivers in discussing the moment. “I think when I saw her tracker and how much she pulled down the straightaway I was pretty damn impressed by the power she has,” he said. “Like I said, this is the least important part of the weekend. Thursday and Sunday are way more important.” And what does he think of this as a milestone? “I think it will give us a temporary hype but every year we come down here and qualifying day seems like the biggest day ever when you do it but when you leave the weekend nobody remembers.” For Patrick, who earned her first Sprint Cup pole in just her 11th career start, it was a relief knowing that she’ll be locked into the event. Get to know NASCAR's first couple — Danica Patrick and Ricky Stenhouse Jr. “It's really amazing how much effort is put into a qualifying car for Daytona, for the 500, and really only the front row is what sticks for Sunday,” Patrick said. “It's nice that all that hard work can pay off and that we can give ourselves that opportunity to lead the pack down into the tri oval for the green flag of the Daytona 500.” What next? For four-time champion Jeff Gordon, there are few things on the NASCAR bucket list left to accomplish. He leads current drivers with 87 Cup victories. He’s earned three Daytona 500s. He won the first Brickyard 400 — and three more — the most of any NASCAR competitor. However, Gordon has yet to win a title under the Chase for the Sprint Cup format. And as the years wind down his opportunities are becoming fewer. “I've come close in '07, but we got beat,” said Gordon, who lost to his teammate Johnson that year. “Obviously to me, there's only one thing left, and that's to win the Sprint Cup championship. “What I've realized as I get older, the things that matter to me, I like to make other people proud, people that put a lot of effort into our race team, my parents along the way, crew chiefs like Ray Evernham, my wife, my kids. Those are the things that motivate me, drive me to work harder and accomplish goals that I haven't been able to accomplish.” FUN TIMES NASCAR is finally back on track — check out all the Daytona 500 action. PHOTOS While Gordon would certainly appreciate a fifth Cup championship, the 41-year-old racer would also enjoy the opportunity to share the experience with his crew chief Alan Gustafson and his family — which came along after he won his last title in 2001. “Alan is one of the best if not the best crew chiefs out there right now,” Gordon said. “I think he deserves to be a championship caliber crew chief or recognized crew chief. I love taking my kids and family to Victory Lane and experience the spoils of great accomplishments like that.” Secret weapon It was not by chance that Stewart-Haas Racing placed all three cars in the top five for next Sunday’s Daytona 500. With the introduction of the new Generation 6 car, it certainly helps when your team has its own wind tunnel at its disposal. Since 2008, when Gene Haas opened Windshear, his teams have enjoyed access to the 180-mph rolling road full-scale wind tunnel. “We use it religiously, it’s been a big help,” Gibson said. “We’re in there like two times a week since we started working on the car.” Numbers game 2: Laps in the restrictor-plate era were faster than the one Danica Patrick ran on Sunday. Kenny Schrader posted the laps in 1989 and 1990. 4: Times Jeff Gordon has started on the front row for the Daytona 500. 35: Years Janet Guthrie held the record for the top qualifying female (ninth) in NASCAR’s top division.

Sorry, it is Sunday and I didn’t go to church today.”",Raw Data

Roger Goodell believes the NFL grappling with concussions and football-related brain injuries will, in the end, make not just football a safer sport but will extend to all other sports – as well as the U.S. military. In a fan forum with Denver Broncos’ season-ticket holders before the Broncos’ playoff game today against the Baltimore Ravens, Goodell spun one of the darkest periods in NFL history – a time when the league grapples with a spate of ex-players committing suicide and many of those players having suffered from brain disease – into a positive for the future. “We are launching a series of initiatives to make the game safer, and frankly, it will make not just football safer but it will make all sports safer,” Goodell said. “What I believe in so much is our leadership role. We’ve brought attention to the issue of concussions … We’ve had an impact on the military. Traumatic brain injury is a big issue for our veterans and our military personnel. The information we have and we’ve learned, the research we have, we have shared with the defense department."" “Those changes are going to make not just football, not just sports, but I think our world safer,” Goodell continued. “And I’m proud of that.” His comments came days after the National Institutes for Health announced that studies of the brain of NFL legend Junior Seau, who committed suicide last year, showed that he suffered from a debilitating brain disease often associated with repeated hits to the head.",Raw Data
691,"Dear Jason: My family was very offended you used my name in connection with Tony Romo in one of your columns. We enjoy your truthful commentary on the NFL. Tony Romo is unworthy of the name Boo Boo, and were Falcons fans around these parts. Thanks, sugar, Honey Boo Boos mama Your NFL Truths for Week 8: 10. The information bubble is the No. 1 obstacle/hindrance for black NFL quarterbacks. This bubble creates delusion, erodes self-awareness and unwittingly undermines a black QBs chance of sustaining success. Cam Newton is a victim of the information bubble. Robert Griffin III is the bubbles next target. Let me explain. Were in our political season. Democrats and Republicans both have their respective information bubbles, MSNBC and FOX News, respectively. They can lock their televisions on a single channel and avoid hearing their perspectives challenged in a credible way and hear their critics lambasted. Its comforting. Its polarizing. Its unhealthy for intellectual growth and our democracy. Black sports fans and black pop-culture media (not sports media) have created a loosely-formed-but-influential social-media and talk-radio information bubble for black QBs. This network of groupthink roars on sports-talk radio, black-owned radio stations, Facebook and Twitter, pumping out the message that Newton, Griffin and others can do no wrong and any criticism of them is rooted in racism. Fear of backlash from this network of well-intentioned enablers causes many mainstream sports analysts (media and fans of all colors) to avoid being totally honest about black QBs. Thats how a career-killing, information bubble is formed. White QBs dont have to deal with this. In Kansas City, a group of fans paid for a banner to be flown over Arrowhead Stadium that called for owner Clark Hunt to bench Matt Cassel. Kansas Citys backup quarterback is Brady Quinn, the Cleveland bust. Hes not a solution. But he was named the starter on Monday. Imagine the uproar if Eagles fans took similar action against turnover-machine Michael Vick? There would be riots in the streets. Philly fans would be labeled racist. Information bubbles are destructive, whether in politics or sports. Cam Newton is being ruined. In the aftermath of Sundays loss to the Cowboys, Newton, once again, handled the postgame news conference horribly. He not-so-subtly criticized his coaching staff. He flippantly quipped that he wanted to bring a suggestion box into the news conference. He condescendingly called a female reporter sweetheart. He sounded like a crybaby and a loser. The black information bubble immediately leaped to Cams defense, claiming Cams critique of the offensive strategy was accurate. The accuracy of his complaints is irrelevant. A quarterback is in partnership with his head coach and offensive coordinator. Their disagreements and criticisms should be handled internally and not referenced at a news conference by the QB. What does RG3 have to do with any of this? Well, informational bubbles are often uninformed. Along with being insecure and defensive, they can also be overly enthusiastic out of ignorance. RG3 is off to a very nice, promising start. But football is not basketball, a quarterback is not a small forward and RG3 is not LeBron James. You could see LeBrons ability to dominate the NBA when he was a junior in high school. Within 10 games of his NBA career, you could tell James would own the league one day. Basketball is the 100-meter dash; the sprinter that gets out of the blocks quick has a huge advantage. Football is a marathon with multiple variables, especially for a QB. Its way too early to anoint RG3. The information bubble has already decided the Colts made a mistake taking Andrew Luck ahead of Griffin. Thats ridiculous. We dont know yet. Theres not nearly enough information. RG3 has the benefit of playing for a highly experienced head coach. Luck is playing for a new coaching staff that is dealing with the loss of its brand-new head coach. Furthermore, in reaction to fear of the black information bubble, the mainstream media seem intent on pitting RG3 vs. Newton. On Monday, rather than individually deal with Cams immature postgame news conference, ESPN spent the day comparing RG3s postgame comments to Cams. Why? It wasnt a conversation about their playing styles and ability to scramble and throw. It wasnt a conversation about Cam and RG3 both winning the Heisman Trophy. It was a conversation about Cams lack of leadership as a second-year starting quarterback. RG3 has nothing to do with that. ESPN is afraid the information bubble will call ESPN racist for pointing out Cam is a poor leader so the Worldwide Leader protected itself by portraying RG3 as the ultimate leader. We dont know if Griffin is a great leader. We wont know until he deals with some real NFL adversity. I suspect hell handle adversity quite well. He might be the Ray Lewis of adversity (Ray might be the best leader in sports history). But we just dont know yet. Compare Cam to Jay Cutler, Vince Young, Jeff George talented QBs who struggled with leadership or compare Cam to his second-year QB peers, Christian Ponder and Blaine Gabbert. LATEST JETS MESS Jets' Ryan involved in car accident Jets owner didn't want Tebow? QBs coach not returning Sanchez, Revis want to remain Rex responds to Tebow reports Jets to part ways with Tebow? Swapping Sanchez for Vick? But dont drag Griffin into Cams problems. Its not fair. Its not right. Its a consequence of the black information sports bubble. 9. Close loss to Patriots further proves the Jets are a bad, poorly coached team. Bad teams find ways to lose even when theyre playing well. The Jets played a great game on Sunday and did just enough to blow it. Stephen Hills drop of a critical third-down pass on New Yorks second-to-last possession of regulation is being pointed to as the key mistake in the Jets demise. New York had to settle for a game-tying field goal. Receivers drop passes. I can live with that. The critical error, in my mind, was strategic. New England fumbled the ensuing kickoff. The Jets had a chance to put the game away. Mark Sanchez was playing well. New York offensive coordinator Tony Sparano foolishly sent Tim Sideshow onto the field on first down to run the wildcat. It was a conservative and stupid move. Timmy Sideshow ran for 2 yards. On the next play, Sparano ran return man Joe McKnight off tackle for 1 yard. It was a conservative and stupid move. Now its third down and all the pressure is on Sanchez and New Yorks offensive line. Sanchez gets sacked, Jets settle for a go-ahead field goal and leave plenty of time on the clock for Tom Brady. Rex Ryan is supposed to have a big pair. He didnt show em on Sunday. 8. Jim Harbaugh played quarterback in the NFL. John Harbaugh was a special-teams coach in the NFL. If youre ever given a choice between hiring a former QB or a former special-teams coach, go with the QB. EYE CANDY We're not just watching the field on Sunday. NFL cheerleaders provide the perfect sideshow. John Harbaugh wants to prove hes an offense-friendly head coach. Thats the only explanation I can come up with for his insistence on preferring Joe Flacco over Ray Rice. We keep repeating the same story in Baltimore. Ray Rice doesnt run the ball enough and Joe Flacco throws it too much. Do John and Jim Harbaugh talk to each other? Jim has a mediocre quarterback he protects with Frank Gore and a running game. John has a mediocre quarterback he exposes by abandoning his running game. John, call Jim for advice. 7. Jon Grudens perfect landing spot is in Detroit. The Lions have the nucleus for a Super Bowl contender. Jim Schwartz is who Jim Harbaugh thought he was. Schwartz is in over his head. I like the Lions' personnel. They have talent. Theyre poorly coached. Jon Gruden is going to return to coaching. You pair him with Matt Stafford and Calvin Johnson and you have an explosive offense. The right defensive scheme and coaching will unleash Detroits front four. The Lions are a sleeping giant. The right coach and theyre the offensive version of the San Francisco 49ers. 6. Broncos fans are on my butt about my early-season comments that Peyton Manning was toast. OK, hes not toast. I was wrong. Mannings arm magically got stronger. He looks great. I dont mind being wrong. Itll happen again. Id love to know how and why Mannings arm got stronger, and thats not a sarcastic criticism. But we went from Mannings arm being it is what it is to being better than what it was. The AFC is weak. I can see Manning and the Broncos taking advantage and winning the AFC Championship. Right now I see the Texans and Broncos in the AFC title game. 5. The schedule is the only logical explanation for the Bears being 5-1. Seriously. Im not buying the Bears. Theyve beaten the Colts, Rams, Jaguars, Cowboys and Lions. Thats not 'Dre, Pac, Snoop, Suge and Nate Dogg. Its not Death Row. Its No Limit Toy Soldiers. To their credit, the Bears blew out Indy, St. Louis, Dallas and Jacksonville. The Bears are a mystery. Is their offensive line any good? Is Brian Urlacher too old? We wont figure the Bears out for three weeks. They play Carolina and Tennessee the next two weekends. Chicago could be 7-1 before it faces a seven-week stretch against Houston, San Francisco, Minnesota, Seattle, Minnesota, Green Bay and Arizona. Jay Cutler wont survive that stretch. J.J. Watt, Aldon Smith, Jared Allen and Clay Matthews are going to annihilate Chicagos offensive line. 4. Did I mention Brady Quinn won the KC starting job with a zero-TD, two-INT, 38-10 blowout loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers? Think about that. Matt Cassel has a $60 million contract and he just lost his job to a guy who played like hes overpaid at $1.5 million. During a series of face-saving interviews last week, Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli promised he didnt dictate to Romeo Crennel or Todd Haley that Cassel had to be the starting quarterback. But Pioli has never signed a viable backup QB to challenge Cassel. Now do you understand why theres a fan revolt (@saveourchiefs on Twitter or saveourchiefs.com) in KC? 3. This is simply a hunch: Its too early to count out the Saints. NFL BOUNTY SCANDAL Titans bring on Williams Sean Payton's suspension lifted Vilma's lawsuit dismissed Tagliabue vacates suspensions Browns LB Fujita blasts Goodell NFL adjusts discipline to players Goodell issues letters to players Player suspensions overturned Im not saying theyre going to make the playoffs. Its nearly impossible to dig out from 0-4. But the Saints are not going to quit. Theyve been in every game this year. Theyre riding a two-game winning streak. They have the Broncos this week on Sunday night. New Orleans will be motivated and emotional. The Saints are going to be a problem for the high-caliber teams left on their schedule (Atlanta twice, San Fran, the Giants, Denver and Philly). I see the Saints finishing 8-8. 2. Bill Snyder is the NCAA Coach of the Year and Collin Klein should be in a two-man race with Notre Dames Manti Teo for the Heisman Trophy. Its difficult to appreciate just how good of a coach Snyder is. He is as good as any coach in football on any level. Snyder is as good as Lombardi, Belichick, Bear Bryant, Saban, Noll and Brady Hoke. (Eat it, Ohio Buckeyes and Urban Meyer.) I dont have any doubt that Snyder could win at the highest level in the NFL, at Alabama, Michigan, Florida, LSU and Ohio. Im not sure Lombardi, Belichick, Bryant, Saban, Noll and Meyer could win consistently at Kansas State. (Hoke could win anywhere they lace em up.) As for Klein, hes not a pro player. Thats fine. But he and Teo are the two most important players in college football. 1. Im officially a Man On Fire: hit a two-teamer with the Saints and Jets over the weekend.

693,"Ken Rosenthal has been the senior baseball writer for FOXSports.com since August 2005. He appears weekly on MLB on FOX. Follow him on Twitter. There is a problem for any American League team that intends to acquire Nationals left fielder Mike Morse and use him often as a designated hitter. The issue, sources say, will carry weight for some AL clubs. Morse is “not a very gifted defender” and would better fit certain teams as a DH, according to one rival executive who leans heavily on advanced metrics. Trades sometimes turn on such details. And Morse, 30, is likely to be traded now that the Nationals have reached agreement with free-agent first baseman Adam LaRoche on a two-year, $24 million contract. Jayson Werth, Denard Span and Bryce Harper will be the Nationals’ outfielders. Morse, who would have replaced LaRoche at first, is without a starting role. Teams value Morse’s right-handed power; his OPS in the past four seasons is .857. But his lack of durability is a concern for some — he has appeared in more than 102 games in a season only once in his career. Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? Morse’s resistance to being a DH, meanwhile, not only could harm his trade value, but also limit him in free agency next offseason. He cannot block a trade. His market, according to sources, shapes up roughly as follows: • The Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays, Baltimore Orioles are among the clubs with varying levels of interest. Morse also could fit for the Boston Red Sox if the team fails to finalize its deal with free agent Mike Napoli. • The Texas Rangers like Morse, but assume other teams will be more willing to meet the Nats’ price — high-ceiling prospects and possibly a left-handed reliever. • The Cleveland Indians could not afford Morse, who will earn $7 million next season before becoming a free agent, unless they traded a player with a comparable salary. These specialists have a knack for hard knocks. Who are the all-time best designated hitters? • The Nationals are unlikely to trade Morse to the Atlanta Braves or Philadelphia Phillies, their two biggest threats in the NL East. The New York Mets, a team in desperate need of outfielders, likely would prefer a longer-term solution. One executive pegs the Mariners as the favorites to land Morse, noting that the team’s earlier acquisitions of DH Kendrys Morales and outfielder Raul Ibanez indicate that the M’s are now emphasizing offense over defense. The Mariners also are involved in talks for Arizona right fielder Justin Upton, but Morse might be a more realistic target. Upton has the M’s on his four-team no-trade list, and the team likely would use Morse in the field, given its other options. Other teams likely would want Morse to be at least a part-time DH. See which players and managers will work in a new city in 2013. The Yankees’ three outfielders — Ichiro Suzuki, Curtis Granderson and Brett Gardner — are all better than Morse defensively. The Rays are seeking offensive help, but greatly value defense. The Orioles like Morse with the idea of dividing his playing time between left field, first base and DH. Nationals GM Mike Rizzo told the Washington Post that the team does not need to trade Morse for financial reasons. At the same time, it’s difficult to imagine the Nats carrying a $7 million player on the bench. Let the Morse sweepstakes begin. Some teams, though, might pause before entering.",Raw Data

Sports opinions? She’s never short of them. And love her or hate her, she’ll be just another one of the boys. Follow her on Twitter or like her on Facebook. Junior Seau died Wednesday of what investigators have ruled a suicide. He launched a bullet into his chest at 43. Forty-freaking-three. Another pro football player too damned young to die and, yet, dead nonetheless. Because of what he did and how he died, Seau's death is being woven into what has become an all-consuming debate on brain injuries and whether football is safe enough to play. This might be right, or he might have killed himself because of lingering relationship issues or financial problems or all of this or none of it. We cannot know, not for sure. So we have conversations about what we think triggered this tragedy. And, yet, all I thought about Wednesday was Don Draper and his “Why I Am Quitting Tobacco” letter in an episode of ""Mad Men."" I am about to compare Seau’s death to a TV show not to trivialize it or because there is anything remotely entertaining about tragic death but perhaps because the only way to understand anything so awful is through one of TV’s most morally complex creations. And what Draper wrote about tobacco is hauntingly relevant now as we talk about football. “For over 25 years we devoted ourselves to peddling a product for which good work is irrelevant, because people can’t stop themselves from buying it. A product that never improves, that causes illness, and makes people unhappy. But there was money in it. A lot of money. In fact, our entire business depended on it. We knew it wasn’t good for us, but we couldn’t stop.” I am not so sure football is not the next tobacco. And I very well may be peddling a product that causes illness, makes people unhappy and, in extreme cases, makes people like Junior Seau feel like a bullet to the chest is better than another breath, that life has become so difficult or so sad or so something other than what he imagined and, therefore, better ended than endured. Why do football players kill themselves? We do not know. We can try to fit it into easy boxes and easy columns to back what we want to say about football. It is the brain injuries. It is the concussions. But much like the uncertainty associated with any suicide, we do not know what was going through the minds of people who took their own lives. Maybe, they were just sad or depressed or unable to cope. Maybe, they were that way because of the pounding their brain took on a football field. There are causal links, for sure, and the way Seau killed himself certainly suggests a guy who wanted his brain intact and able to be examined because he believed 20 years of football tackles and collisions had screwed it up beyond help. As a result, there will be a lot written about how football needs to be cleaned up, or rogue coaches like Gregg Williams banned. We cheer the suspension of Saints player Jonathan Vilma, as if our feigned outrage will bring Seau back or be any more effective than slapping a Band-Aid on a tumor. Dirty players do not kill players. Bounties do not kill players. Football kills players. There is no entirely safe way to play the game — not on the level we watch on Sundays — just like there is no safe amount of cigarette smoking. The warnings are on the packs now. The surgeon general and just about everybody else agrees smoking is the worst thing you can do for your health, aside from maybe football. We watch a show like ""Mad Men"" where everybody is smoking and wonder what they were thinking. Is it so wrong to wonder if we will look back 20 years from now and judge this generation? What was everybody thinking by playing and watching something as life-threatening as football? Both smoking and football are dangerous. Only recently have we come to know just how dangerous the football was. There is mounting evidence as players retire from the NFL broken in ways nobody could comprehend. Many of them hobbled by the game they played. They are the lucky ones. There are others who cannot remember their children's names, who do not feel like themselves, who feel as if their brain is forever broken. Dave Duerson was one, the former Bears player who shot himself in the chest to save his brain. He wanted it examined for scientific purposes, and probably legal ones, too. Because Seau also shot himself in the chest, his death will be linked to Duerson’s. This is the stage we are at, guessing and speculating and drawing conclusions that are logical but unproven. As a result, we ask questions that have no concrete answers — like, is a game worth the human cost? Of course it is, because it is not simply a game. It is big business. Both Big Tobacco (then) and pro football (now) have a lot of money riding on not looking dangerous. It was the end of the business as Big Tobacco knew it once the causal relationship between cigarettes and cancer was established. What really did in Big Tobacco was learning how much they knew and how much they withheld because doing so helped their bottom line. The NFL is a billion-dollar industry, and of course, it has a vested interest in downplaying how inherently dangerous its game is. It is inevitable that everything the NFL does going forward is legal and defensible. Whatever the league says, know it is more interested in protecting the brand than in the brains of its players. There are other parallels between tobacco and football. Both Big Tobacco and football had rogue doctors, letting guys back onto the field too soon and starring in commercials touting the benefits of smoking. Both are glorified. Cool people used to smoke; now, they play hurt. The toughest guy used to be featured with a cig in Marlboro commercials; now, he is the guy who does not tap out no matter how injured he is. Big Tobacco was brought down by insiders and, ultimately, public opinion. It is only recently, after public opinion has shifted, that the NFL has started to clean up its game. Kids will still play football in 20 years, just as people smoke even now when you cannot watch an NHL playoff game without being inundated with commercials detailing just what a hellish nightmare tobacco is to your health. They will make a choice. They will do so under the influence. The smokers are addicted to the nicotine; the football players, to the money and fame. And we are addicted to the game, enjoying touchdowns and comebacks and trying to push from our brains days like Wednesday. Which is how I got to thinking of Draper and his letter, about Seau and culpability. ""And then, when Lucky Strike moved their business elsewhere, I realized, here was my chance to be someone who could sleep at night, because I know what I’m selling doesn’t kill my customers."" What I believe in my heart is Seau wrote his own Don Draper “Why I Am Quitting Tobacco” letter Wednesday. But he did not have the words. So he used a gun.",Raw Data

697,"JACK WILSHERE claims Arsenal must take inspiration from Chelsea's fighting spirit if they are to save their season. The Gunners were beaten 1-0 by Blackburn in a humiliating FA Cup shocker at the Emirates on Saturday. Now their last chance of silverware is the Champions League, with Bayern Munich in north London tomorrow for the first leg of their last 16 clash. Arsene Wenger's struggling side are overwhelming underdogs - but so were Chelsea when they won the tournament against the odds last season. And Arsenal midfielder Wilshere reckons they could still end their trophy drought if they all band together like the Blues. He said: ""Chelsea are an inspiration because they were not having a good season last year. ''Okay, they got a bit lucky in some games but they showed great team spirit and character and we need to do that. ""We need to come together as a team. We have good leaders and a good team atmosphere and that's going to help us. ""We have a good bunch of lads in the dressing room and we have winners as well, the likes of Lukas Podolski and Mikel Arteta. ""Everyone said the FA Cup was our best chance of a trophy. Obviously it wasn't but we have to regroup now for a big game tomorrow."" It doesn't get much more daunting than Bayern, who are 18 points clear in the Bundesliga and unbeaten in their last 20 games. Wilshere said: ""We know what Bayern are capable of because they have a great team, and that's why we need everyone behind us when we face them. ""It's not ideal to go into a game like that after the loss to Blackburn but we have to put that behind us and show character. ""We've beaten big European teams here before so we need to do it again. ""We need a good defensive display and then we have to counter them well, so it will be an interesting game.""

You need a bit of luck but I believe in our chances. ""Anything can happen in the Champions League - we saw that last year with Chelsea, who had difficult games against Barcelona and Bayern Munich. ""It is a tournament so anything can happen, and there is the same pressure on us as there was against Blackburn. ""They defended really well - they came for a draw I think and got the win.

698,"LOS ANGELES Without question, the 2012-13 season is one of the worst in the history of pro basketball's marquee franchise. But no matter what kind of hole the Lakers dig for themselves, you can't ever count them out of a game because of a grizzled youngster named Kobe Bryant. Yes, Bryant is in his 17th pro season at age 34, but he's playing every bit as superbly as he did at age 21. Game after game he does whatever is necessary to keep the Lakers from becoming an embarrassment, and the last two wins are indisputable examples Kobe's greatness. After scoring 42 points Wednesday night in New Orleans to lead the Lakers back from a 25-point deficit to beat the Hornets, Bryant bombarded the Toronto Raptors with 41 points 15 in the fourth quarter to give L.A. a 118-116 overtime win at Staples Center. The victory moved the Lakers to one game over .500 at 32-31, just the second time this year they've gone above the break-even point, and the first time since coach Mike D'Antoni's debut on November 20. Bryant also had 12 assists for the second game in a row, but hurt the Laker cause a bit with nine turnovers. He said that gave him even more incentive than normal to try and lead the Lakers to a victory. ""I was completely irresponsible with the basketball all night long,"" Bryant said with a sigh. ""I wanted to get into a position where I could somewhat redeem myself."" Redemption came in the form of two spectacular three-pointers in the last 29 seconds of regulation that sent the game into overtime, where he added four points, including a driving dunk with 10 seconds left to seal the win for the Lakers. Dwight Howard backed up Bryant's effort with 24 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks, and said that despite the nail-biting tension, come-from-behind wins like that are a lot of fun to play in. ""They are great fun to play in,"" said Howard, who immediately added that they're really only fun if you win them. ""These kinds of wins are good for our team as we continue to try and get better. ""We stuck together, made some plays and Kobe hit some tough shots at the end. He's putting everything he's got into it and we're doing our best to help him out."" Even if it takes mighty runs at the end of games to squeeze out victories that should have been much easier. D'Antoni is certainly not taking a ""hey we won and that's all that matters"" approach, saying the Lakers have to give a better effort from tip-off until the final buzzer if they want to have any hopes of making the playoffs and possibly advancing. ""We come out playing like we're seeing if we can win without exerting ourselves,"" D'Antoni said disgustedly. ""Then, when that doesn't happen, they turn it into high gear. ""We've got to have more intensity coming out of the gate, especially defensively. ""The first five minutes tonight were just bad, and when we play like that, we're risking (a loss). We have to change our mentality."" Because as great as he is, even Kobe Bryant can't bail you out every night. THREE THOUGHTS 1. Games like the ones Friday night are great confidence boosters for the fans, but players know the real story about what's going on with their team. And while nobody will say it on the record, the fact is that the Lakers just aren't anything more than a mediocre basketball team with four future Hall of Famers and an enormous payroll. Despite a nice run of 15 wins in 23 games, they still haven't had that huge, confidence-building victory that could propel them into the playoffs with a legitimate shot at an NBA title. With the huge comeback win over New Orleans Wednesday, you'd think something like that would spark them to give maximum effort for 48 minutes or more. For some reason, however, it doesn't resonate with this Laker team. 2. It's easy to blame the coach for the team's shortcomings that's why most get fired if their squad consistently underachieves when surrounded by high expectations. Most of the time that's an easy way out for management when it needs a scapegoat for a bad year, but in the Lakers' case, blaming the coach is not only easy it's correct. Not to play amateur psychologist here, but it's obvious that D'Antoni hasn't found a way to get through to his players and convince them to play with heart and determination every time they step on the floor for practice or a game. From what I've seen, there's no reason to think it's ever going to happen. Only an unlikely run to a championship will give D'Antoni and his staff job security once this season ends. 3. Sometimes D'Antoni is his own worst enemy when he opens his mouth. Recently, he's been talking about how great Pau Gasol had been playing before tearing the plantar fascia, and how big of a role the Spaniard will have when he returns in a few weeks. Excuse me, Mike: Isn't this the same guy you were belittling not long after you took over from Mike Brown? The same Gasol you said was kept on the bench late in a game because ""I wanted to win the game. That's the reason."" Now he's making Gasol sound like a purple and gold savior. And don't think that Gasol's teammates haven't noticed the inconsistent treatment the popular 7-footer has received ever since D'Antoni was hired.",Raw Data
699,"But with 3:31 left in the opening frame, the deadpan crowd sparked, suddenly, to life — and it wasn’t a reaction to the loose-ball foul that had just been committed by LaMarcus Aldridge, or any other play, in particular. Instead, it was an almost visceral response to Amar’e Stoudemire, who had just risen from the bench, removed his warm-up shirt, popped on his protective goggles and chalked his hands in preparation for his first NBA action of the season. Hampered by various injuries for much of his 11-year career, the veteran big man Stoudemire’s latest setback was the result of a debridement procedure on his left knee, the same one he had microfracture surgery on in 2005. After a ruptured cyst behind the knee limited Stoudemire to just 27 minutes of action in one preseason game this October, doctors made the determination that the six-time All Star would undergo the procedure to remove damaged tissue from the area. As Stoudemire rehabbed, the Knicks (21-10) rumbled out to their best start in decades, leading the Eastern Conference for most of the first two months of the season before their recent regression. And as a result, there were many legitimate questions about how Stoudemire’s eventual return would be received and how the big man’s presence might disrupt the delicate balance New York seemed to have found. In an unremarkable 17 minutes Tuesday, Stoudemire gave little indication as to how his insertion into the lineup will help or hurt the Knicks in the long term, and no one expected a throwback performance out of the one-time Phoenix Suns star in his first action of the season. But based on the standing ovation the crowd offered as Stoudemire checked into the game for his first minutes of the season — a gesture that Stoudemire, a man who has tears tattooed on his face, said brought tears to his eyes — it seems the New York supporters are glad to have him back, regardless. “I was nervous, my heart was beating fast, I had butterflies in my stomach, and I felt like I was a rookie all over again,” said Stoudemire, who had six points on 3-of-8 shooting. “…It was a phenomenal feeling, and I haven’t quite felt anything like that before in my career. So it was great to see that the fans were all patient with me and waiting for me to return.” The warm fuzzies wore off quickly, of course, when Stoudemire stepped on the baseline just 15 seconds into his debut, for one of his two turnovers on the night. And he did little to rectify the situation over the course of his 9:31 of first-half action, missing all five shots he took as New York dug itself a 19-point hole and took an 11-point deficit into the break. However, the second half and coach Mike Woodson’s implementation of more pick-and-roll offense brought more success for Stoudemire, who made all three of his field-goal attempts in 7:10 on the court, including two thunderous dunks — one of them over a helpless Victor Claver. “The game felt like it was going 100 miles per hour in that first half,” Stoudemire said. “I got a couple easy looking shots, open shots, (and was) just a little bit rusty, wasn’t able to knock those down. But my second half was a lot better than my first half, and hopefully my second game will be better than my first game. I hope that trend continues.” Before the game, Woodson indicated that he would be slow to work Stoudemire back into the rotation, and wouldn’t commit to whether Stoudemire’s eventual role will be as a starter or a reserve, though many think he’s better suited as a $100 million backup. But for the time being there won’t be any pressure — from the fans or Stoudemire or his teammates — to get him back playing heavy minutes. His early offensive struggles aside, Stoudemire looked lost on defense on multiple occasions — like early in the second quarter, when his missed rotation led directly to an alley-oop dunk for J.J. Hickson (18 points, nine rebounds). Woodson repeatedly called Stoudemire over to the bench to coach him up, and until he’s up to speed with New York’s defensive schemes, Stoudemire won’t see the kind of time he’s used to. “We had some miscues based on some coverages and rotations and things of that nature,” Woodson said. “I expected that that was going to happen, so I’ve got to help him, I’ve got to let him know. We’ll show him some things on film [Wednesday], and hopefully he’ll learn from it and we’ll build on it day by day and see what happens.” Stoudemire wasn’t the only Knick making a return to the lineup Tuesday, as Carmelo Anthony returned from a two-game absence with an efficient 45 points on 24 shots to lead all scorers. But New York struggled to find offensive balance once again, with Anthony and J.R. Smith (28 points, 10-of-22 shooting) accounting for 73 percent of the team’s scoring. And the defense, which was once among the NBA’s elite, always seemed to be a step slow covering rookie guard Damian Lillard (21 points), Nicolas Batum (26 points, six 3-pointers) and LaMarcus Aldridge (19 points, 14 rebounds), who torched them all night, and from all over the floor. It would be easy to blame that on Stoudemire’s return, but, unfortunately, it has been a problem that has plagued New York for some time. “Defensively, we’re just not where we were earlier in the year, and we’ve got to get back to that,” Woodson said. “Because you can’t keep spotting teams 20-plus point leads and think you’re going to win basketball games all the time. There’s just too much of an uphill climb to do that.” By the fourth quarter, the MSG crowd’s rampant lethargy from earlier in the evening seemed to have worn off, especially once Anthony’s 3 cut the lead to 100-97 with 57 seconds left and — after a 3 by Lillard — ‘Melo again made it a one-score game with an and-one dunk down the lane with 29 seconds on the clock. But as the Knicks battled back, it was hard not to notice Stoudemire’s absence, as he sat on the bench with his knees wrapped in ice. And though there is doubt as to how well Stoudemire will acclimate himself to the lineup around him, it’s hard to imagine how New York could possibly be worse off with him. After the game, Stoudemire said he didn’t feel any pain in his knee and said he hardly felt any stiffness, but the true test will be how he feels when he wakes up Wednesday morning. Stoudemire said his veteran teammates told him it would take five or 10 games to get back up to full speed, but the Knicks will gladly take STAT at any speed as long as the strides to form chemistry now pay off later. “It’s always a tough adjustment because you get in a rhythm and get used to certain things, and then things change,” said center Tyson Chandler, who had 10 points and seven rebounds Tuesday. “But we know we’re a better team with these guys, so we’ve just got to find a way for us to all be in rhythm.” Added Stoudemire: “That takes time. These guys have been playing well all season long, so there’s no rush to force the issue right now. When that time is needed and Coach needs me, then I’ll be there.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data
700,"Hazard was sent off by referee Chris Foy for kicking Charlie Morgan in the closing stages of Wednesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Liberty Stadium. The Belgium playmaker lost patience when the 17-year-old ball boy refused to hand over the ball after it had gone out for a goal-kick. Morgan fell to the ground as Hazard attempted to get the ball from him, with the 22-year-old then trying to kick it from under him but appearing to instead make contact with the youngster. QPR manager Redknapp sympathises with Hazard and holds Morgan responsible for the incident. ""Hazard toe-poked the ball under the boy's body. Why is the kid lying on the ball in the first place?"" he said. ""You can imagine the frustration - you're a player trying to reach a cup final but there's this kid behaving like an idiot who won't give you the ball back. ""Hazard didn't kick the kid, he kicked the ball underneath him, but the whole thing got blown out of all proportion. ""I can think of a lot of players who would have kicked a bit harder than he did. He just toe-poked the ball away. ""The boy was tweeting before the game that he's a super time waster. The way he behaved was disgusting."" Morgan himself briefly broke his silence on Thursday night, tweeting: ""Crazy 24 hours. Spoke to Hazard and I will not be pressing charges. Be in touch."" Despite that, South Wales Police have been obliged to continue investigating the incident after receiving three complaints. ""Three calls have been received from members of the public living in Sussex, Kent and west Wales which are being followed up,"" a police spokesman said. Hazard was assumed to have avoided criminal charges when the matter was dropped after he and the teenager met and made mutual apologies. It then emerged Morgan was no mere ball-boy but the son of millionaire Swansea director Martin Morgan. Charlie's parents Martin and Luisa Morgan own almost a quarter of the Premier League club and their son enjoys a lifestyle most professional footballers would envy. Lifelong Swans fans, the Morgans amassed their 42million through owning and selling a travel agency and then investing in boutique hotels.",Raw Data
701,"But seeing his plaything progress from this FA Cup fourth-round replay to face Middlesbrough at the Riverside on February 27 did not seem like nectar to the billionaire. Skipper Terry and his deputy Lampard are, apparently, not Abramovichs best buddies of late, but they delivered to help quell the challenge of battling Brentford. At least Terry has a full season left on his contract. Lampard, now Chelseas record scorer in the FA Cup with 36 goals, looks set to go at the end of this season. This was not one of Lamps brightest shows. He could have had a hat-trick to take him to within a strike of Bobby Tamblings club best of 202 but was surprisingly out of sorts before the break. Still, when he went off in the 81st minute, it was to a standing ovation. Abramovichs hands stayed buried in his pockets. And it was a sunny 10 degrees in west London yesterday! Similarly, when fans chorused Frankie, we want you to stay after his goal, the tycoons lips remains sealed. Abramovich would make a good poker player. At least Rafa Benitezs men, the Cup holders, are on a decent run of three straight wins, nine goals scored and just one conceded. But this game could have been oh so different if Brentford had enjoyed a bit of fortune. Chelsea started the brighter. Lampard scuffed a shot into the ground and Oscars follow-up was blocked by Harlee Dean. Then Lampard blazed over and Oscar slipped and miscued his shot on to a post after being put clear by the excellent Mata. Next came a cruel blow for the Bees in the 40th minute. David Luiz tripped Adam Forshaw and referee Neil Swarbrick blew in an instant, not realising the ball had broken free for Marcello Trotta to slot home with his left foot. With the Chelsea fans so hard on Benitez it would have been interesting to see how they would have reacted to seeing their team go behind again to Brentford, who led twice at Grifﬁn Park in the 2-2 draw and were just seven minutes off a fabulous giant-killing. Lampard continued his off-day, sidefooting a right-foot volley wide. Then in the 54th minute Mata showed his team-mate how to ﬁnish. A punt downﬁ eld from goalkeeper Petr Cech was nodded down by Demba Ba and, after a touch to control, the Spaniard drilled in a 20-yard left-foot shot. As Eden Hazard came on for Victor Moses in the 66th minute, the visitors fans taunted Chelseas £50m striker Fernando Torres on the bench. We want Torres, they sang. Hazard had an instant impact, releasing Branislav Ivanovic on the overlap to the byline in the 68th minute. His pullback found Oscar and his clever backﬂick took a deﬂection and went underneath Simon Moore and through the legs of Dean on the line. Dean was at fault again in the 72nd minute, diving in to challenge Mata but easily being turned by the super Spaniard. He burst down the left and picked out Lampard with a perfect delivery, allowing him to sidefoot home a neat volley. A minute later Terry made it four, embarrassing Tony Craig at the far post to power in a header from an Oscar cross. Luiz was lucky to escape a second booking  or even a straight red  in the 84th minute, when he cynically shouldered 19-year-old substitute Jake Reeves off the ball as he burst through the centre of midﬁeld, forcing the Bees to complete the game with 10 men. That was nothing to do with the magic of the Cup for sure, but maybe Abramovich enjoyed it!",Raw Data
702,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. How could two franchises — successful ones at that — look at the same player and have completely opposite talent assessments? It’s another example of how beauty is in the eye of the beholder (we are talking football beauty, by the way, with Ninkovich currently sporting a grotesque black ""playoff"" beard). The rosters for New England and Baltimore entering Sunday’s AFC Championship Game feature plenty of long shots and undrafted players who made it, like Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. But what happened with Ninkovich is especially curious considering the quality job New Orleans head coach Sean Payton and general manager Mickey Loomis have done with personnel decisions. In four seasons with the Patriots, Ninkovich has registered 223 tackles, 19.5 sacks, four interceptions and five forced fumbles as a linebacker and defensive end (his current position). He led New England in sacks this season with eight and remains a core member of the special-teams unit. A 41-28 victory over Houston in last Sunday’s second-round playoff matchup was a Ninkovich showcase. He baited Texans quarterback Matt Schaub into a third-quarter interception by sliding over from his left end spot and dropping into coverage in the middle of the field. The Patriots converted the turnover into a touchdown to take a 31-13 lead. Ninkovich wasn’t done, either. He recovered an onside kick late in the fourth quarter to snuff any chance for a Texans comeback. Ninkovich finished with four tackles (including one for a loss), two passes defensed and a quarterback hurry. “He is a tough, smart player and in the right spot at the right time,” Patriots wide receiver Wes Welker said. “There is something to be said for that. When he gets the opportunities he makes the plays.” In New Orleans, Ninkovich ran out of opportunities to show what he could do — and the Patriots couldn’t be more grateful. A 2006 fifth-round pick out of Purdue, Ninkovich appeared as a reserve in three games before suffering a season-ending knee injury. He was waived in training camp the following season and landed with Miami. Ninkovich spent 1½ nondescript years there before being re-signed by New Orleans off the Dolphins’ practice squad late in the 2008 campaign. Just before the start of the 2009 preseason, Ninkovich said he was told the only way he was going to stick with the Saints was as a long snapper. He had handled the duties at Purdue and Joliet (Ill.) Junior College, but developing this skill for a full-time living was something Ninkovich had no interest in trying to pursue. “I looked at them and said, ‘Well if that’s my only chance, I guess I had better just start snapping,’” Ninkovich told FOXSports.com after Thursday’s practice at Gillette Stadium. “Certain opportunities have to open up for you. At that time, I didn’t have the opportunity to be a defensive player. I was never going to quit on it. That was my opportunity at the time. I had to take it. I couldn’t say no and ask for my release or anything like that. That’s not in my DNA.” The Saints didn’t immediately respond to an email sent by FOXSports.com seeking comment from Loomis. Mercifully for Ninkovich, the long snapping competition in New Orleans ended before it began. Ninkovich was waived when the Saints signed veteran Jason Kyle and he quickly signed with New England. Ninkovich has never asked the Patriots what they saw in him. But it’s clear – Ninkovich is the kind of smart hybrid player that head coach Bill Belichick loves. Ninkovich began as a linebacker when New England fielded a 3-4 defense but made a successful switch to 4-3 end this season. At 6-foot-2 and 260 pounds, Ninkovich is strong enough to hold up against the run while still being able to effectively rush the passer and contribute in zone coverage. “It starts with his skill set,” Belichick said earlier this week. “Rob is a good athlete. He has good body control, balance (and) hand-eye coordination in addition to being a strong guy that’s fast and has good quickness. If he has to drop into coverage as a defensive end, he can fall back on some of the things he’s learned as a linebacker. His versatility compiled with his instinctiveness comes together in favorable form.” Ninkovich believes he began making a positive impression in his first day of Patriots practice. “I was training in New Orleans so it was 100 degrees with 100 percent humidity,” he said. “I came here and it felt like spring. It was 85 and everybody thought it was warm but I was running circles around everybody. “I had a great training camp and was able to earn the respect of the coaches and everyone here. I didn’t really know the plays yet. I had just come here and they were having their first preseason game. I was told, ‘Just go make plays.’ I can do that.” Ninkovich has done it time and again. Patriots special teams captain Matthew Slater called him “Johnny-on-the-Spot” for his uncanny knack of finding the football. Ninkovich is growing weary of the “right place, right time” compliments because such praise can infer there is more luck than skill involved. “That kind of gets old when you do it multiple times,” he said. “I feel like I play the game the way it should be. I play hard. You’re never going to see me not give everything I’ve got on a play. If that’s chasing a guy down, I’m not giving up. That’s the way I am.” That fortitude is evident by Ninkovich now being one game away from a return to New Orleans – not to face the Saints but to play in Super Bowl XLVII. “Coming into the league, I was trying to do my best to make an impact on kickoffs and kickoff returns and make my way onto the field on defense,” he said. “Looking back now, I’m very blessed to have the opportunity to come here.”",Raw Data
703,"Andre Drummond won’t be playing in the BBVA Rising Stars Challenge at All-Star weekend – and he might not be suiting up for the Pistons until late March. The back injury Drummond said he incurred in attempting to block a Steve Blake shot during Sunday’s loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at The Palace has been diagnosed as stress fracture of the fifth lumbar vertebra. Drummond, who saw Pistons team doctors on Thursday and underwent further testing on Friday, will be out four to six weeks, according to Dr. Ben Paolucci, Pistons team physician. The regular season ends on April 17, which would be roughly a month after Drummond could be ready to return. The injury was discovered by way of an MRI exam Drummond underwent on Thursday. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that a stress fracture should have no residual effects, Paolucci said. In other words, unlike disc injuries that often lead to chronic back trouble, once the stress fracture is healed, it’s healed. Once Drummond is “asymptomatic, doesn’t have any pain,” Paolucci, who said Drummond’s injury is “not uncommon,” said he would be able to begin on exercise programs. He estimated that process could take four weeks. Drummond has been fitted with a custom brace, he said. Lawrence Frank met with reporters before the Pistons released the extent of Drummond’s injury, though Frank already knew of his status. “I know what the story is,” he said. “He went to see a doctor today. We’re fully aware of what it is, wrapped our arms around it. We’ll just move forward.” Over 50 games, Drummond has shown steady – and often remarkable – improvement from a player the Pistons weren’t certain would be ready to crack the rotation when training camp opened. He averaged 7.3 points and 7.5 rebounds in 20 minutes a game and emerged as an impact player at both ends with his instinctive offensive rebounding skills, his elite ability to finish at the rim and his athleticism defensively giving the Pistons the rim protector they’d sought since the glory days of Ben Wallace and Rasheed Wallace. Drummond played on Monday against New York, one day after suffering the injury, but was shut down at halftime when he informed the training staff that he was having difficulty getting his back loose. He felt better on Wednesday, but four minutes into his stint against Brooklyn, Drummond absorbed a charging foul from Brook Lopez and landed on his tailbone, exacerbating the injury, he said afterward. He didn’t return to the game. Drummond saw Pistons team doctors on both Thursday, sitting out practice, and went through more tests on Friday that determined the nature of the injury. With Drummond sidelined, Frank will weigh his options for the frontcourt rotation. Slava Kravtsov is the player who most closely approximates Drummond’s skill set as another athletic 7-footer who has a track record as a shot-blocker in Europe. But Kravtsov has played sparingly this season, just 24 minutes spread out over six games. Eleven of those minutes came in Wednesday’s loss to Brooklyn, when he scored four points and grabbed two rebounds. “That’s why you carry three centers,” Frank said before Friday’s game with San Antonio. “It’s a great opportunity for Slava. He’s putting a lot of work in. He’s been extremely professional.” Frank could also attempt to alter the rotation so that Jason Maxiell, though undersized, plays backup minutes to Greg Monroe at center while Charlie Villanueva and Jonas Jerebko fill in at power forward. Jerebko has been playing as Kyle Singler’s backup at small forward since last week’s trade that shipped Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye to Memphis and brought point guard Jose Calderon to Detroit from Toronto. “We’ll also need more from Greg, more from Max, Charlie and Jonas,” Frank said. “That’s the NBA – next man up.” True Blue Pistons",Raw Data
704,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Thirty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have passed concussion legislation for youth athletes, often referred to as the Lystedt Law. Here are the states that have not. • Arkansas • Georgia • Hawaii* • Michigan* • Mississippi • Montana • New Hampshire* • Nevada* • Ohio* • South Carolina* • Tennessee • Vermont • West Virginia* * -- Legislation pending Sources: NFL, FOXSports.com research Lystedt suffered a debilitating brain injury as a 13-year-old player in 2006 because his concussion wasn’t properly detected or treated. He underwent two emergency surgeries after collapsing during a middle-school game. He was hospitalized the next three months and has spent years in physical therapy that continues to this day. His speech is now impaired. He can walk only with a cane and for limited distances. Playing football again was never a possibility. Lystedt, though, is determined to help other teenage athletes avoid the same fate. The endeavor that Lystedt, his parents and supporters are tackling is far more significant than any stops he could have ever made on the gridiron. He is the impetus for the Lystedt Law, a piece of legislation designed to address the concussion epidemic in both male and female youth sports. Under the law, all athletes, parents and coaches must annually receive mandatory education about the perils of concussions and signs that a player could be affected. Any athlete who is suspected of having suffered one must be immediately removed from the game or practice and is barred from returning until receiving medical clearance from a licensed health-care professional. Three years ago this month, Lystedt’s home state of Washington became the first to approve this legislation for athletes under the age of 18. Thirty-four more have since followed suit. Dr. Stan Herring, a Lystedt Law advocate and member of the NFL’s head, neck and spine committee, said the safeguards instituted and attention drawn to concussions has helped “transform public awareness and the treatment of concussions by giving them the respect they deserve.” “The difference (in awareness) is huge,” Lystedt told FOXSports.com last week in a telephone interview. “When I was 13 years old, there’s no way I could have known what an impact I’d have on the world.” Lystedt was like lots of other teenagers from all walks of life back then. He loved football, particularly his hometown Seattle Seahawks and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis. That hasn’t changed, but Lystedt’s life did drastically in October 2006. He became one of the roughly 400,000 student-athletes who, according to statistics compiled by Ohio State University and Nationwide Children’s Hospital, suffered a concussion that year. Hitting his head on the ground had left Lystedt woozy. After sitting out for a short period of time, Lystedt re-entered the game and took another blow to the helmet. That triggered bleeding in Lystedt’s brain. For the first few days, doctors told Lystedt’s parents that their son might not survive. Even when he did, Victor and Mercedes Lystedt didn’t know how much brain damage Zack had suffered. Zack was unable to speak for the first nine months after his injury. “I never really wanted to know what tomorrow was going to bring because I was frightened of it,” Victor Lystedt said. “Is Zack going to wake up knowing who his dad and mom are? Is our son ever going to be able to do anything again? “Here he is almost 14 (years old). I remember when I was 14 I got to run the streets and do everything. My son was not going to be able to do that now. I was blown away. It was terrible.” The Lystedts found an outlet to channel that grief. Richard Adler, the attorney who represented the Lystedts in their lawsuit against the school district (an undisclosed settlement was reached in 2009), was so shaken by the circumstances surrounding Zack’s injury that he began crafting what became the Lystedt Law’s foundation. Support followed by members of the medical profession, the Seahawks and the NFL itself. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who is trying to address concussion problems in his own league, wrote letters to state governors urging passage. Goodell has met with the Lystedts and personally pledged that his advocacy will continue until the entire nation has passed the bill. The NCAA also is assisting the NFL with its lobbying efforts in the final 13 states that haven’t given approval for a variety of political and non-political reasons. “One of the things we’ve learned is that kids need way more recovery time after a concussion than adults,” Victor Lystedt said. “Adults don’t die from this. They have different brains than kids. “Once people know the potential consequences, it becomes an easy decision. Most every parent and coach is going to make the right decision because it can become a catastrophic event thereafter. That awareness became our job after Zack got injured.” Zack is now becoming a direct part of that advocacy. He has recovered to the point that he delivered his own presentation about concussion awareness at a Seahawks-sponsored youth football clinic as well as a gathering of doctors and physical therapists. He will speak again later this month at Tahoma High School in Covington, Wash. to present the first-annual Zackery Lystedt Award that will be given to a student who overcomes adversity. Having graduated from the school last year, Lystedt is taking a college class and continuing his physical therapy. A big step came last week when Lystedt was able to bend his right leg in the swimming pool so that the quadriceps was supporting his effort to walk. When he couldn’t immediately reach his father to share the good news, Lystedt texted another one of his biggest supporters: Ray Lewis himself. The two struck up a friendship last year when Lewis visited with him the day before the Ravens played at Seattle. “Ray is kind of turning into a mentor,” Lystedt said proudly. “He motivates me in ways he can only motivate me. Like how a coach motivates you, that’s how Ray motivates me.” Lystedt then laughed. “I’m not saying my dad’s not a good coach or anything but Ray just has words of encouragement and success. It’s a lot of good words.” Added Victor Lystedt: “Ray also has got it so that if Zack can keep on working hard, that means Ray has to work hard. He’s flipped it on Zack. He’s saying, ‘I’m not your motivator. You're motivating me.’” Victor and Zack Lystedt are also again doing something that created a tight father-son bond before the latter’s accident. They watch NFL games together. “We’re still football fans,” Zack said. They both notice one thing has changed. The announcers, like the NFL itself, are placing far more emphasis on the serious nature of concussions and the potential damage if not properly managed. Zack Lystedt is part of the reason this has happened. But that doesn’t mean he has become complacent in championing his cause. “I’m not even done,” Zack Lystedt said. “That's the crazy thing.” Tuesday, Part II will examine why states are reluctant to embrace the passing of legislation to protect youth football players from post-concussion damage.",Raw Data

Just before Thanksgiving, Jovan Belcher spoke about how grateful he was for his family, friends and Kansas City Chiefs coaches — those who helped an undrafted free agent linebacker from Maine become an NFL starter. “First and foremost, God. Family and friends just keeping me focused, coaches and just everyone,” Belcher said in an interview with KCChiefs.com, the team’s news website, on Nov. 21. At 25, Belcher appeared to have achieved all his dreams, professionally and personally. Eleven days later, Kansas City police allege Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Michelle Perkins, 22, before going to the Chiefs practice facility at Arrowhead Stadium and fatally turning the gun on himself as team personnel pleaded with him to stop. According to the Kansas City Star, Police Capt. David Lindaman said Belcher and Perkins, parents of a 3-month-old daughter, got into an argument around 7 a.m. Saturday at their home in the 5400 block of Crysler Ave. in Kansas City. According to police, at about 7:50 a.m., Belcher shot Perkins multiple times. The victim was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Lindaman said Belcher’s mother, who was visiting the couple and their new baby, witnessed the shooting and is being interviewed by police. A neighbor told FOXSports.com he was stunned by the tragedy. “There have never been any issues in the past,” said Freddie Sinclair, who lives next door to the site of the murder on the 5400 block of Crysler Ave. Belcher left the scene and went to the Chiefs’ headquarters, police said, encountering general manager Scott Pioli, head coach Romeo Crennel and other team personnel at the Arrowhead Stadium facility. Police were summoned to the stadium at about 8:10 a.m. It was there, police say, that Chiefs personnel worked to keep Belcher from committing additional acts of violence, to no avail. As police arrived, they heard a gunshot. “The coaches said when (the police) pulled up (that) they were never in danger,” Darin Snapp, a public information officer at the Kansas City Police Department, told reporters outside Arrowhead. “He never threatened them. They talked for a little bit.” The Chiefs released a statement: “We can confirm that there was an incident at Arrowhead earlier this morning. We are cooperating with authorities in their investigation.” Belcher was in his fourth year with the Chiefs, joining the team as an undrafted free agent out of Maine in 2009. A special teams staple, he earned the starting inside linebacker job at the start of the 2011 NFL season. He recorded 87 tackles that season. In the offseason, Belcher agreed to accept a tender offer and re-signed on March 22, 2012. He played in 11 games this season, starting 10, with 38 tackles and one pass defensed. He had no career interceptions. He was regarded as a hard-working player, an overachiever, who rose from being a standout multi-position football player and wrestler at West Babylon High School in New York, in the heart of Long Island, to earn a $1.927 million base salary as an NFL starter in 2012. In his Nov. 21 interview with the Chiefs website, Belcher described his drive to succeed beyond his small college background. “You just have to be hungry,” Belcher said. “It had to be like taking my plate on Thanksgiving. You have to want it more than the next person. You have to just refuse to be denied.” Asked to describe his first NFL play, Belcher echoed the thoughts of many who take football’s ultimate stage” “Fast. Very fast.” At West Babylon High, Belcher played linebacker, offensive tackle, nose tackle and fullback in addition to being a standout wrestler, a three-time All America selection in that sport. As a senior, Belcher led his football team to its first undefeated regular season. For the Maine Black Bears, he played defensive end his junior and senior years, making the switch from outside linebacker, where he played as a sophomore and freshman. Belcher believed his skills at various positions as a prep star helped him be a more well-rounded athlete. “Just being versatile,” Belcher told KCChiefs.com about his sports background. “I think it helped build my whole mental mentality, to never give up and just keep fighting and wrestling was a big part of and it still is.” The University of Maine issued a statement Saturday detailing Belcher's career at that school: ""Jovan Belcher of West Babylon, N.Y., attended the University of Maine from 2005-2008 and was a linebacker through the 2008 football season, when he was one of two senior co-captains. He graduated from UMaine in December 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in child development and family relations. In his senior year, Belcher was named the 2008 CAA Preseason Defensive Player of the Year and named to the Preseason All-CAA Team. In his UMaine career, Belcher played 44 games. His stats include 293 tackles, 44.0 tackles for loss and 18.0 sacks. UMaine Head Football Coach Jack Cosgrove says Jovan was a “tremendous student-athlete. 'His move to the NFL was in keeping with his dreams,' says Cosgrove. 'This is an indescribably horrible tragedy. At this difficult time, our thoughts and prayers are with Jovan, Kasandra and their families.'"" —FOXSports.com national writer A.J. Perez contributed to this report.",Raw Data

Jones played his entire 19-yaer career with the Braves, finishing with 2,726 hits, 1,623 RBIs, 468 home runs, a lifetime .303 average and an OPS of .903, the highest of any Braves player in history. What he called a dream come true brought it all rushing back. Theres just this wave that comes over you, kind of disbelief and kind of a reflection of Where has it all gone? and How did it happen so quick? he said. It was 19 years but it seems now like it went by in a flash. I guess what we all want to do is try to leave our mark and this is certainly a good indication that you left your mark. Jones will become the fifth figure from the Braves run of 14 consecutive division titles to have his number retired, joining Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Bobby Cox and John Smoltz. While Jones won National League MVP in 1999, a league batting title and two Silver Slugger Awards, its their World Series runs together that Jones says came to mind wheb he was told no other Brave would ever wear No. 10 again. We play a team sport and our goal every year down here at spring training was to give ourselves an opportunity to win a World Series, Jones said. I got a chance to do that in 95 and got a chance to play in two more World Series in 96 and 99 and I think a lot of players would die for three opportunities at World Series. Back in the 90s, we felt like it was going to happen every year. We felt like it was our right to be in the World Series. Its not easy and the best team doesnt always win, which has been illustrated. But having three opportunities and getting one under our belt, that was huge and something Ill never forget. Madduxs jersey was retired in 2009, with Glavine, Cox and Smoltz in the three years that followed. But as manager Fredi Gonzalez said, Jones No. 10 could be the last one retired for some time. ""Good for (Jones),"" Gonzalez said. ""That's no surprise to anyone or anybody. But I started thinking, who's the next guy? But it's like whose the next guy that we have that spent 18 years with the organization."" As Juan Francisco and Chris Johnson, the players vying to take Jones hold job at tird base, Jones stood on the grass, his fielding now reserved to taking balls thrown over by the fielders and dropping them into a bucket at his feet. During batting practice, Jones peered in, his foot propped up on the cages wheel, watching the likes of B.J. Upton, Justin Upton and Jason Heyward take their cuts. He would offer a few words of advice and worked with the younger players, breaking down their swings. Jones is close to the game again, but theres no itch to be back on the field. Hes comfortable with his new vantage point where he can visit, then return to his new life. I thought this week would be pretty hard. But I stand out there while theyre watching ground balls and I dont really miss it, Jones said, laughing. I standing behind the cage watching them face live pitching and I see somebody hit a ball off the end of the bat and I know how that feels. Youre fingers go completely numb and I dont miss that. When theyre conditioning at the end of the day and theyre huffing and theyre puffing, I dont miss it. There are things hell miss; the camaraderie with the teammates and coaches and the everyday banter, but its one time he says hell miss most of all. Id be lying if I said I wasnt going to miss from 7-10 (p.m.) when the game starts, Jones said. But its all the other stuff that you have to endure during a course of a season that Im over. So like I said, Im OK with it. Ive come to grips with it. His is a career that, most certainly, will end with enshrinement in Cooperstown when hes eligible for the Hall of Fame after the five-year waiting period. Hes the only switch-hitter in history with at least a .300 average and 300 home runs and is second all-time behind Eddie Murray for RBIs by a switch-hitter. The accolades and whatever comes after youre done playing, thats really out of my control, Jones said. My motto in life is Dont worry about things you cant control. What I can control is the resume that I put up and thats over. ... All I know is I went out and did the best I could with what Ive got.?",Raw Data

The lottery was conducted in a televised event live from ESPN studios in Bristol, Conn. The Mercury had 276 chances out of 1,000 to receive the first overall selection, the second most of any of the four teams in the Lottery mix. It marks the third time Phoenix has won the WNBA Draft Lottery. The Mercury previously came away with the No. 1 overall selection in the 2004 Draft, which they used to select Diana Taurasi, and for the 2009 Draft, when they chose Lindsey Harding. Chicago, which had the smallest chance of winning the Lottery (10.4 percent), will have the second pick in the Draft, and will be followed by the Tulsa Shock, which had the second fewest chances (17.8 percent). fourth pick. WNBA officials and a representative from the accounting firm of Ernst & Young conducted the Draft Lottery at ESPN Headquarters in Bristol, Conn. to establish the order of selection for the first four picks of the 2013 WNBA Draft.

708,"With a strong arm that allowed him to pick the Packers apart from the pocket and speedy legs that helped him break free for big gains, Colin Kaepernick did a little bit of everything in a record-setting, sensational playoff debut - and Aaron Rodgers just couldn't keep up. Kaepernick passed for 263 yards and ran the San Francisco 49ers right back to the NFC championship game with a 45-31 win over Green Bay in an NFC divisional game Saturday night. Kaepernick rushed for a quarterback playoff record 181 yards and two touchdowns and threw two scoring passes to Michael Crabtree. Next up for the Niners: a game on Jan. 20 for a spot in the Super Bowl, against the winner of Sunday's game between the Seattle Seahawks and Falcons at Atlanta. ''It feels good. We're one step closer to where we want to be,'' Kaepernick said. ''I feel like I had a lot to prove. A lot of people doubted my ability to lead this team.'' And what a playoff debut it was by the second-year pro making just his eighth NFL start. No doubting Jim Harbaugh's big midseason gamble switching quarterbacks now. Rodgers never got in sync for the Packers (12-6), finishing 26 of 39 for 257 yards with two touchdowns. Kaepernick ran for scores of 20 and 56 yards on the way to topping the rushing mark of 119 yards set by Michael Vick in 2005 against St. Louis. Crabtree caught TD passes of 12 and 20 yards in the second quarter and wound up with nine receptions and 119 yards for the Niners (12-4-1) in the NFC divisional matchup. Kaepernick, sporting a burgundy beanie partially covering his head, was greeted at his locker after the game by former 49ers quarterback John Brodie. San Francisco had 579 total yards with 323 on the ground, scoring its third-most points in the franchise's storied playoff history. ''Our offensive line did an amazing job today,'' Kaepernick said. ''They shut everybody down inside. Our receivers, our tight ends, blocked great outside, and our running backs were running hard, so it made it easier on me.'' Frank Gore and Anthony Dixon each added 2-yard touchdown runs in the fourth quarter for the No. 2 seed NFC West champions, slim favorites on their home field in a rematch of Week 1. They added to their memorable night by setting a franchise postseason record for yards rushing, 119 of those by Gore to complement Kaepernick. Rodgers, the former Cal star passed up by San Francisco with the No. 1 pick in the 2005 draft, never got going. Rodgers rooted for the Niners as a kid in Northern California. This was another early exit for the Packers, who lost in the divisional playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants a year ago and were denied a chance to defend the title they won after the 2010 season. Those Green Bay road stars of two years ago - they won three away from Lambeau Field on the way to the Super Bowl - didn't have it this time against San Francisco's stingy defense and a no-fear, second-year quarterback who would not be denied. A kid who was born in Milwaukee and grew up a big Green Bay fan until the day he was drafted in 2011 out of Nevada. ''I didn't know how fast he was,'' Green Bay defensive back Charles Woodson said. ''Coming in I really never paid attention to it. But he is fast.'' San Francisco advanced to back-to-back NFC title games for the first time since reaching three in a row following the 1992-94 seasons, with 1994 their last trip to the Super Bowl. With the sellout crowd at Candlestick Park waving red flags reading ''Quest for Six'' - a sixth Super Bowl title, that is - Kaepernick did his part and then some to deliver in the first key step. Even after an early interception that gave Green Bay all the momentum in a hostile road stadium. Kaepernick topped Vick's mark with the 56-yard keeper on an option play in the third quarter. That gave Kaepernick 163 yards on 12 carries, also setting a 49ers franchise record for the postseason. ''The execution for the 49ers on the read option was excellent, but our issues were bigger than that,'' Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. ''We did not a very good job of keeping him the pocket. He was able to get out of the pocket for a number of big conversions.'' Kaepernick joined Jay Cutler in 2011 and Otto Graham in both 1954 and `55 as the only players with two rushing and two passing touchdowns in a playoff game. David Akers kicked a 36-yard field goal moments before halftime to give San Francisco a 24-21 lead at intermission after Green Bay tried to ice the struggling veteran by calling timeout before his kick. Mason Crosby's 31-yard field goal tied the game at 24 midway through the third quarter, then Kaepernick took over again. San Francisco's defense handled the rest. Kaepernick had 11 carries for 107 yards rushing by halftime. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. The strong-armed Kaepernick brushed off the interception he tossed on the fourth play of the game that Sam Shields ran back 52 yards for a touchdown, then took control with his pinpoint passing to his favorite go-to guy - Crabtree - and with his quick-burst ability out of the pocket. ''He does a great job of responding,'' Harbaugh said. ''He has done that any time there has been an interception he has thrown, a safety or a turnover, he's responded with a scoring drive. That's rare. I think that's a rare quality. So far he's shown that he's got that ability to come back.'' San Francisco, fueled all year by its near miss in overtime of the NFC title game, made it two victories against Rodgers and Co. this season after a 30-22 Week 1 win at Lambeau Field. Kaepernick bounced back from the early interception and again after a second-quarter taunting penalty in which he threw the ball down in the face of safety M.D. Jennings after being hit by Jennings and Erik Walden. Center Jonathan Goodwin grabbed Kaepernick in an effort to settle him down after his 15-yard run was negated by the 15-yard flag. Two plays later, Kaepernick found Crabtree for his 20-yard TD as San Francisco capitalized on another Packers turnover. Rodgers answered right back on the Packers' next chance, driving his team 80 yards on six plays and hitting James Jones on a 20-yard touchdown of his own that tied the game at 21. Green Bay got help from a 15-yard personal foul penalty by Dashon Goldson for a helmet-to-helmet hit on DuJuan Harris. ''We felt like we gift-wrapped them 14 points off turnovers in the first half and our defense was playing all right,'' Rodgers said. ''And then we just didn't get it done in the second half. I knew we were going to have to score some points. We knew we were going to have to put up at least 38 points.'' Former California receiver Jeremy Ross fumbled Andy Lee's punt early in the second and C.J. Spillman recovered as San Francisco got the ball back at the 9. Kaepernick threw a 12-yard TD pass to Crabtree three plays later. Rodgers' streak of 183 passes without an interception spanning the previous five games ended when Tarell Brown picked off the ball on a deep third-down throw in the second quarter. Brown had another interception in the waning moments. ''We expected them to try to get him out on the perimeter. But we didn't expect to let him do what he did,'' Woodson said. ''Give him a lot of credit. He played a great game. He made a lot of great plays out there today. It was hard to swallow.'' Harris ran 18 yards for a score in the final minute of the first quarter as Green Bay took a 14-7 lead. Rodgers connected with James Jones on a 44-yard completion one play earlier before Harris easily ran right up the middle into the end zone for a Packers team that managed 45 total yards rushing in the season-opening loss. Such moments were few against a 49ers defense happy to welcome back All-Pro lineman Justin Smith after he missed the final two regular-season games with a partially torn left triceps muscle. Notes: The Green Bay defense gave up the most total yards (579), yards rushing (323) and second-most points in the playoffs in franchise history. ... San Francisco improved to 13-3 at home in divisional playoff games. ... The 49ers had 48 offensive plays in the first half to 20 by Green Bay.",Raw Data

LATEST IN ACC HOOPS Kelly returns, Duke tops Miami Wake retires Chris Paul's jersey Virginia Tech defeats Clemson The son of Dell Curry, Virginia Tech's second all-time scorer, scored 19 of his 22 points in the first half as No. 6 Duke opened a 20-point lead and sent Virginia Tech to its ninth consecutive loss, 88-56 on Thursday night. ''I just wanted to come out tonight and play well,'' Curry said. ""The first two times I played terrible.'' He took care of that in short order, hitting three of his five 3-pointers before the game was 7 minutes old. ''I'm always trying to be aggressive early on,'' Curry said. ''Coach called the first few plays for me so I was able to get some good looks and they went down.'' Curry finished 6 for 14 from the field overall, but missed only once in six tries from behind the arc. Duke shot 53.6 percent for the game (30 of 56) and was 12 for 17 on 3-pointers (70.6 percent). ''Our shooting was terrific. Seth set the tone for that in the first half,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ''He put on an amazing display with 19 points and we stayed steady the whole time.''

Duke, meantime, buried the Hokies quickly with a 3-point barrage. Curry had three 3s and Quinn Cook and Sulaimon also connected in an early 19-6 run, and after the teams swapped baskets, Curry capped a 15-3 burst for Duke with his fourth 3-pointer of the half. ''Curry came out on fire,'' Virginia Tech coach James Johnson said. ''Before I could turn around he had 19 points.'' That made the score 37-17 after 16 minutes, and Curry added a fifth 3 before halftime. Duke was 8 for 9 from behind the arc in the first 20 minutes.

710,"OAKLAND The most important player on the Los Angeles Lakers' star-studded team sat wrapped in a black robe at his locker after the game, his body hurting, his words at times whispered, the exhaustion emanating from him in waves. He'd just returned from seven weeks off with a leg injury and somehow managed to play 41 dazzling minutes and use them to spin the Lakers into an entirely new team. ""We needed it,"" Steve Nash said of the Lakers' rousing 118-115 comeback and overtime win over the Golden State Warriors. ""We need to build every day. And we needed something to build on."" What they needed, it turned out, was Steve Nash himself. That idea that Nash's return wouldn't by itself prove enough to reverse the Lakers' 2012 doldrums? Dismiss it. For one night, at least, he made a notion that had seemed like the wishful thinking of embattled head coach Mike D'Antoni look pretty damn real. The man Kobe Bryant called a great point guard after the win, the leader D'Antoni labeled, simply and accurately, a ""winner,"" and the missing ingredient Dwight Howard curiously dodged praising after his own tough outing was everything every one of them needed him to be. Nash turned a flood of faults, many belonging to those three men, into the team's best win of the season. It came with a mix of awe and delighted surprise to sit in the stands and watch Nash return and change everything. Watching him work alchemy on the Lakers prompted that rare feeling that comes with watching an all-time great who still has it at an age 38 that reminds you his magic is fleeting, that the greatness unrolling before your eyes is special in part because it cannot go on forever. That was what bubbled across the brain as Nash hit huge shots down the stretch, including a 14-footer with 36 seconds left in overtime that sealed it, as he made incredible passes, as he turned the pick and roll into an art form, as he created space for a team suddenly alive with confidence, as he undercut a Warriors team that is very, very good. Nash finished with 12 points and nine assists in a game in which his numbers couldn't do justice to his impact. ""I think that we're a completely different team with him out there,"" D'Antoni said. Most important for the Lakers, Nash obscured the glaring issues that before his return had sunk them, had filled the locker room with doubt and had cast a shadow over D'Antoni's leadership. Bryant's mind-boggling shot selection? He was 16-of-41 41! but it didn't matter. Howard's lackluster competitive spirit, highlighted by the fact he played just 28 minutes during an overtime game because he picked up five early fouls and finished with just 11 points and six rebounds? An afterthought. That porous defense that has marked D'Antoni's brief L.A. tenure much more than his up-tempo offense? No big thing. Even Howard's surly mood after the game, and what it does or does not portend about his ability to accept a sometimes-diminished role or diminished nights if the team wins big games, can wait for another time. The fact is, the Lakers needed this win as much as they needed to look, finally, like the Los Angeles Lakers. ""We played hard,"" said Bryant, who had 34 points. ""That's the thing we talked about during our time off. Dwight had four or five fouls at the time. Pau had four or five fouls. We weren't playing particularly well. I wasn't shooting the ball well. We just said that we had to go harder. It didn't matter what the challenge was. We just had to go harder, and that's exactly what we did."" Harder meant coming back from a 14-point deficit early in the fourth quarter. It meant taking everything the battle-tested and still 18-10 Warriors threw at them. Harder meant seven lead changes in the fourth quarter, it meant Kobe scoring seven of his points in the fourth quarter and overtime, it meant Nash hitting a huge three with 1:46 left in the fourth-quarter to give the Lakers a lead and Nash using a pick and roll to get the ball to Howard, who got it to an open World Metta Peace with 26 seconds left in the fourth quarter to again take a lead. It meant, as the Warriors answered every barrage, finally seeing a Lakers team able to step up to a big moment against a very good team and get it done. Nash, for his part, said there's more to it than him. ""If we become a great team, that's not down to me,"" he said. ""If we don't, it's not down to me either."" A week ago I would have agreed with him. Today? Today, having seen him in action, I'm not so sure. There are a ton of problems and issues that the Lakers will have to work out to get where they want to go. But maybe Steve Nash really is the answer to solving them and getting there.",Raw Data
711,"Eurosport - Tue, Feb 12, 2013 13:33 GMT Related Content Bet on Cycling Hamilton described one transfusion which caused an adverse reaction from his body, making his urine turn black. Speaking through an interpreter by video link from the Spanish embassy in Washington, Hamilton spoke for almost three hours about his time as a patient of Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes between 2002-04 when the rider paid him as much as 110,000 euros (£90,000) for his services. The 41-year-old, who came clean about his doping past in an award-winning book 'The Secret Race', said he met Fuentes, who denies involvement in doping, at a clinic or in apartments in Madrid and Monaco and in ""many, many hotel rooms"" and the pair spoke and sent text messages using ""secret phones"". With Fuentes watching him on a large-screen television, the American told the court in Madrid his first blood transfusion under the doctor's direction was in March 2002 and he said he had met him ""probably 15 times"", each time having blood extracted or reinjected. Their relationship ended in September 2004 when traces of someone else's blood was found in one of Hamilton's samples and the rider was suspended for two years, he added. Last August the American was stripped of the time-trial gold medal he won at the 2004 Athens Games by the International Olympic Committee. ""Yeah he (Fuentes) gave me a calendar with a schedule of races, a schedule of when to take what performance-enhancing drug and if I remember right he gave me EPO (erythropoietin),"" Hamilton told the court. ""He offered me EPO, testosterone, growth hormone, insulin, I think that's it,"" added the American who was wearing a light grey suit, white shirt and striped tie. ""My biggest fear was something like this (trial) would happen."" Fuentes and four other defendants, including his sister Yolanda, are appearing in court almost seven years after anabolic steroids, transfusion equipment and numbered blood bags were seized by police as part of the Puerto investigation. The proceedings have attracted international scrutiny because anti-doping authorities, who are represented in court, are hopeful it will finally lead to evidence of wrongdoing by athletes in sports other than cycling coming to light. Fuentes said shortly after the trial began he had clients in sports including soccer, tennis, athletics and boxing. A World Anti-Doping Agency request for access to the blood bags has been repeatedly denied by the Spanish courts and the organisation awaits the Puerto judge's ruling on their latest petition made last month. As Spain's current anti-doping legislation was not in force in 2006 when the police raids took place, Fuentes and his fellow accused are being tried for violating public health regulations and the prosecutor has asked for prison terms of two years. Hamilton, who said he used EPO and banned growth hormone treatments before becoming involved with Fuentes, was questioned about whether he had been warned of the possible risks from blood doping and if he had any adverse reaction to the transfusions or drugs. He said he had always checked to make sure his code number ""4142"" was on the bags of blood to be reinjected. ""I had a transfusion in July of 2004 (during the Tour de France) that gave me a bad fever and I felt sick,"" said Hamilton. ""The reason why I knew was that 30 or 40 minutes later when I went to the bathroom my urine was black. ""The insulin I tried one time but did not like the way it made me feel, sweating, increased heart rate, just a strange sense. ""You'd always feel a little bit different. I would say that no two times were exactly the same. But yeah your body reacted to the blood extractions and reinfusions."" The judge asked Hamilton if he had anything to add at the end of his testimony. ""Yeah I'm sorry for breaking the rules,"" he said. Fuentes responded to Hamilton's testimony, saying: ""He knows what he has done, he has said he has done many things with many people"" The lawyer for one of the defendants then announced he no longer wished to call Spanish rider Alberto Contador to the stand. Contador, who was stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title after testing positive for a banned substance, was due to appear in court on Friday. The trial is set to end on March 22.",Raw Data

715,"The agony that Arsene Wenger was going through after Arsenal's Capital One Cup defeat to Bradford was clear to see in his tortured post-match interview - and I have to admit, I felt for him. Even though he hasn't guided Arsenal to a trophy since 2005, it's hard to watch him going through the ringer because since he first arrived at Highbury over 12 years ago he has brought so much to the English game. Arsene Wenger: facing arguably the biggest test of his 16-year reign as manager? Back then he was a real innovator and went on to create a team unlike any other; he brought a freshness and a joy to the game, playing in a style that a lot of other teams are now imitating. I've never believed that the day would come when I thought Wenger might walk away from the club but looking at his body language the other night I honestly think that could happen. I've never believed that the day would come when I thought Wenger might walk away from the club but looking at his body language the other night I honestly think that could happen. Jeff Stelling Quotes of the week He still has a year-and-a-half left on his contract but it's abundantly clear that he isn't enjoying his football at the moment and as things stand I think there is a real danger that he might not see out those 18 months. So Arsenal fans - particularly those who are protesting against Wenger now - be careful of what you wish for. Those fans should be asking themselves 'how many managers are there out there who could replace him and do a better job?' If pushed I can think of only one and that's Pep Guardiola, who seemingly wants to manage not only in England but at a London-based team. Everybody has jumped to the conclusion that will be Chelsea but I'm not so sure. But apart from Guardiola, who do you want Arsenal fans? Do you really want Jose Mourinho with his 'win at all costs' approach? Maybe you do - but do you really want a manager who pokes opposition coaches in the eye when things are going badly? Let me know if you like by using the feedback form at the bottom of this page. In the past people have criticised Wenger for sticking by his principle of playing kids in the League Cup's various guises, so it must have been particularly galling for him to put out a strong team against Bradford, to lose and still end up taking plenty of flak. But when you consider the players who were out there on the pitch, I don't think you can level the finger of blame at Wenger this time - not when he selected the likes of Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla, Gervinho, Lukas Podolski, Wojciech Szczesny, Per Mertesacker and Thomas Vermaelen. Wenger has been criticised in some quarters for failing to motivate his players but when it comes to the quarter-final of a cup competition - particularly a match that could see them on the wrong end of a potential giant killing that would be a blot on their CV forever more - the players should be able to motivate themselves. I'm not going to be a total apologist for Wenger, though, because one of the things that puzzled me about Tuesday's match - and I'm sure it puzzled Arsenal fans as well - was how Wenger set up the team. Podolski is effectively a central striker yet he was playing out wide; Gervinho is a wide player but was playing as a central striker; Aaron Ramsey is a central midfielder, yet took up a wide role. Maybe Wenger, after so successfully transforming Thierry Henry from winger to striker, thinks he can do it again? But it rather smacks of square pegs in round holes, I'm afraid, and it causes a fair amount of dissatisfaction. The question, with the January transfer window approaching, is can things really continue like this at Arsenal? Disgruntled fans will say 'no' but there's still a very good chance that Arsenal will finish in the top four at the end of the season and, if that's the case, I know of 88 other league clubs who would love to be in that position. At present Arsenal are a soundly-run club. Some supporters will say they err too much on the side of caution but Arsenal did spend significantly in the summer and it amazes me when I hear people say that Arsenal need to go out and buy players for the present, not the future. Have those same people not looked at the ages of Olivier Giroud, of Podolksi and Mertesacker? Wenger did go out and buy established players in the transfer window. The trouble is that this time around the younger players haven't really flourished for one reason or another; I'm thinking of Wilshere, in particular, and before that, Kieran Gibbs. The Emmanuel Frimpongs of this world who were supposed to be 'the next generation' are struggling to deliver. Frimpong, currently on loan at Charlton, is just one of a phenomenal number of players at Arsenal who haven't quite made the grade there and perhaps never will. I've read reports this week that Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has promised to make 'significant funds' available to Wenger in January so that he can strengthen the squad but the club's recent lack of success means that attracting high-calibre players will be difficult. Moreover, Arsenal's commitment to a rigid pay structure is a major stumbling block - one that cost them the services of Robin van Persie and probably Samir Nasri too. Who knows - it may cost them Theo Walcott in the not too distant future as well. So how are Arsenal going to attract the superstar names unless they break that structure? Every manager out there will tell you that January is the worst time to buy, and in Arsenal's case it's hard to see how they can achieve immediate returns because there aren't many players eligible to play in the last 16 of the Champions League who will sign for a wage that is less than they believe they are worth. For my money, Arsenal simply have to give the players who are there right now more time to prove themselves. Giroud has barely had a decent run in the team. Likewise, Podolski has been in and out. Yes, they've just got Wilshere back but only because he's playing at 90 per cent and the return of Abou Diaby, who was fantastic when he was fit earlier in the season, still seems some way off. Personally, I think Arsenal should be reluctant to go out there and spend for the sake of spending. The club is being carefully run and they shouldn't ruin that with a kneejerk, panic spending spree. Instead they should wait until the summer and if things are no better by then, Wenger - if he is ready for the challenge - will have a far greater number of players to choose from. Jeff's Gem of the Week Sorry Arsenal fans, but you know what is coming - yes, it's Bradford. It was quite something for a team of lower league pros who have been around the block a couple times to produce a performance like that. They were outstanding throughout the whole 120 minutes even if for much of the second half it was backs-to-the-wall stuff. They showed terrific resilience and when Arsenal equalised I don't think there was a football fan in the land - not even in Bradford - who did not expect them to capitulate in extra time, but they didn't! The bottle they showed was something else. Alan Connell's penalty, which put them 3-1 up in the penalty shoot-out, was absolutely fantastic. Bradford have always had fantastic support and rightly so because they were one of the very first clubs to introduce an innovative scheme where you could buy a season ticket for a ridiculously low price. They did it just to fill the ground and they did so successfully that a lot of clubs have followed their example. There are obviously good people running the club. I'm so pleased for the manager Phil Parkinson because he hasn't had the easiest of times since his success at Colchester. Meanwhile Bradford have spent years in the doldrums and it's so good to see them on their way back. They've got a good ground, a fantastic fan-base and a good manager. Hopefully, from their point of view, they can go further in the cup and secure promotion as well.",Raw Data
716,"NEW YORK, NY February 25, 2013 New York Liberty Head Coach and General Manager Bill Laimbeer announced today that the team has re-signed guard/forward Essence Carson and agreed to a contract with free agent guard Katie Smith. Per team policy, the terms of both deals were not disclosed. It was very important for us to re-sign Essence. She is a cornerstone of our franchise moving forward. Essence is a very athletic guard that should drive our style of play, said Laimbeer. We were also fortunate to acquire Katie. She brings leadership, toughness and a discipline for the game. Carson played in all 34 games in 2012, making 23 starts. She was third on the team in scoring with a career-best 11.6 points per game and also averaged career highs in rebounds (3.4) and assists (1.7). Carson, entering her sixth year in the league, has appeared in 168 career games averaging 8.6 points, 2.4 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. A seventh overall pick of the Liberty in 2008, Carson earned her first career WNBA All-Star nomination in 2011. She has made trips to the playoffs in four of the past five seasons, including the Eastern Conference Finals in 2008 and 2010. In 16 playoff games, Carson is averaging 8.9 points and 2.7 rebounds per contest. A 14-year veteran of the league, Smith is a two-time WNBA Champion, winning a pair of titles with the Detroit Shock (now Tulsa) under Laimbeer in 2006 and 2008. She is a two-time First Team All-WNBA selection, and in 2011 was voted one of the Top 15 Players in WNBA history. Smith has made seven All-Star appearances, which is tied for the league all-time lead. She ranks first in the WNBA in both three-point field goals made (878) and attempted (2,377), and is third in free throws made (1,412) and career points (6,244). Smith boasts career averages of 13.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game during the regular season in addition to shooting 36.9 percent from three-point range. In eight playoff appearances, she has totals of 12.8 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game. Her success also extends to the international level, having captured three Olympic Gold Medals in 2000, 2004 and 2008. Smith is the all-time leading scorer in the history of womens professional basketball (ABL & WNBA) with over 7,000 career points. Smith signed with the WNBA in 1999, joining the Minnesota Lynx after a two-year stint in the ABL. She has played for four franchises - Minnesota, Detroit, Washington and Seattle - during her WNBA career.

717,"Victoria Azarenka overcome an often hostile crowd to win back-to-back Australian Open titles, beating Li Na 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a dramatic final on Saturday that contained a break for fireworks, two medical timeouts and a nasty fall that caused Li to black out momentarily. The Chinese star first tumbled to the court after twisting her left ankle, and had it taped after falling in the fifth game of the second set. On the first point after a 10-minute pause in the third set while fireworks crackled overhead from nearby Australia Day celebrations, Li fell over again and slammed the back of her head into the court. The women's final between Victoria Azarenka and Li Na offered great tennis and plenty of drama. See the photos. The 2011 French Open champion was treated immediately by a tournament doctor and had another time out before being allowed to resume the match. The second incident didn't appear to affect Li's movement, but she later said it was a serious fall. ''I think I was a little bit worried when I was falling down,'' she said. ''The head was touching the floor. Because two seconds I couldn't really see anything. It was totally black. ''So when the physio come, she was like, `Focus on my finger.' I was laughing. I was thinking, `This is tennis court, not like hospital.'' Azarenka, who broke down in tears and sobbed into her towel when the match ended, won four of the next six games to claim her second major title and retain the No. 1 ranking. ''Unfortunately, you have to go through some rough patches to achieve great things. That's what makes it so special for me,'' she said. ''I went through that, and I'm still able to kiss that beautiful trophy.'' The win meant that Azarenka will maintain top spot and Serena Williams, who lost in the quarterfinals, will become the new No. 2 in the rankings. On a crisp Saturday night, Azarenka won the coin toss and elected to receive, a ploy that seemed to work when a nervous Li was broken to start the match. After a double fault on the first point, Li's forehand long gave Azarenka the early lead. The 2-hour, 40-minute match featured 16 service breaks, with Li losing her service nine times. When she first injured her ankle, Li was trailing 3-1 in the second set. When she came back, she won three of the next four games to level the set at 4-4, but Azarenka broke back and then her serve to level the match. Azarenka broke in the opening game of the final set, just two games before the match was suspended for the fireworks, a planned stoppage of play that both players were notified about before the match. While Azarenka jogged around and practiced her serving motion during the 10-minute fireworks break, Li sat on her courtside chair for most of the stoppage. It was on the first point that she again fell to the court. From the outset, the capacity crowd at Rod Laver Arena was firmly behind Li, cheering loudly when she was introduced. Azarenka, meanwhile, had her errors applauded, and one spectator even mocked the loud hooting sound she makes when she hits a shot. The chill from the crowd was a remnant of Azarenka's semifinal win over American teenager Sloane Stephens, when Azarenka was criticized for taking a questionable 10-minute medical time out near the end of the match. She was accused of taking the time out to compose herself after she'd wasted five match points while serving for the match against Stephens, although Azarenka said she needed the time out because a rib injury was making it difficult for her to breathe. In the second set Saturday, a few fans heckled Azarenka over the incident. One man yelled, ''Take a deep breath, Vicky.'' By the end of the match, she appeared to have won some of the fans back. Azarenka's friend, rapper Redfoo, yelled down to her from the player box ''You deserve it,'' and she later blew kisses to the crowd. Someone else in the crowd shouted ''Victoria, we love you.'' Azarenka appeared to quickly forgive the crowd, saying during the trophy presentations that she wanted to thank the fans for their support. ''I will always keep very special memories of this court and it will be in my heart forever,'' she said, pausing several times to find the right words. ''Of course, I (almost) forgot to say congratulations to Li Na, she's had a terrific start to the year ... hope to see you in many, many more finals.'' Azarenka and Li had met twice before in Grand Slam tournaments, with Li winning both times - in the fourth round of the 2011 Australian Open and quarterfinals at the French Open. Li lost the 2011 Australian Open final to Kim Clijsters but won her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros a few months later, beating Francesca Schiavone. But after failing to advance past the fourth round at any major in 2012, Li hired Carlos Rodriguez, Justine Henin's former coach. The hard training he's put her through in the past four months appears to be paying dividends. Li won a WTA tournament in China before travelling to Australia, where she advanced to the semifinals at the Sydney International. She said she could take heart from her recent experience at the Australian Open, where she lost in the final in 2011 before winning the French Open three months later, and Sharapova doing the same last year. ''So I don't know, maybe I wish I can do the same this year, as well,'' Li said. In the men's final on Sunday night, Novak Djokovic attempts to win his third consecutive Australian Open against U.S. Open champion Andy Murray. Djokovic has had the benefit of an extra day off after an easy three-set win over David Ferrer on Thursday night, while Murray needed a tough five-setter to defeat Roger Federer. Murray has predicted a tough match with long rallies against Djokovic, the player he beat in the final at Flushing Meadows in September. ''I'm ready for the pain,'' he said. I hope it's a painful match, that will mean it will be a good one.'' In the other final Sunday to end the year's first Grand Slam, the unseeded pairs of Jarmila Gajdosova and Matthew Ebden of Australia and the Czech Republic's Lucie Hradecka and Frantisek Cermak play for the mixed doubles championship.",Raw Data

Velamuri, India Why Arsenal Won't Sign Anyone It's not that there isn't anyone out there, it's not that the money isn't there...it's more that they haven't got a specific weakness. Hang on before you lynch me, hear me out. The trouble with Arsenal is that it is just generally across the board that they are...well just a little bit mehhh. They are ok but like 20% or 25% short of what you want. I'ts not like you can say 'Arsenal are great if only they had a new keeper they would win the league'. Basically other than maybe Jack Wilshire you could name three or four players that are better in almost every position. So, firstly, that means the replacements are bloody expensive and secondly that also means then that it is a very difficult team to turn around, you almost need to swap out most of the team to make a real impact. One player not even Messi or Ronaldo would really make the difference (Okay they would make a bit of a difference but not enough!). So, sorry Arsenal fans, it's probably another two years before they can win something. Andy, Toronto 44 Trophies To Ex-Arsenal Players. Anybody Beat That? *Sigh* Arsenal fans, please stop putting a '$' or a '' in the name of your outgaining players name. Examples are: A$hley Cole or Ca$hley Van Per$ie Na$ri Ce$c Fabrega$ Yes blah blah blah they are on more money, but since your last trophy in 2005 a total of 44 trophies have been enjoyed among the outgoing star players at your club. Source here: http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4498786/Stars-quit-Arsenal-and-win-44-medals.html 44! To Arsenals 0...in 8 years!!! I won't go through them all, but you've got the obvious ones like Vieira, Henry, Nasri, Cesc and Cole, but there's even players like Lauren, Seb Larsson, Reyes, Sol Campbell and Lass Diarra. I wonder if any other club can match that kind of difference of 44 trophies to outgoing players since leaving within eight years. Maybe Leeds? I'd be interested to know. TJ (Wil$here to Man United...eventually) Good Luck Wilf Congratulations Wilf. In my opinion United is the best place for him to develop his talent. While it is sad to lose a player with his quality who has come through the academy, it is an inevitability of our current status. The deal our chairmen have got is a good one with money to strengthen now and Wilf staying until the end of the season to help our promotion push. His ambition matches his talent and he fully deserves a move to a massive club like United. Everyone at Palace will wish him well and make the most of him for the rest of this season, it will be a while until we see such a player again. For the United fans what you have got is an amazing talent, he does everything at such pace and it makes him incredibly difficult to play against. I have seen him do things that are difficult to comprehend just sitting watching so can't imagine what playing against him must feel like. Quite often he has two or three players marking him, which frees up the rest of our team and in particular Bolasie on the other wing, but this is demonstrated in his goal statistics. Some would argue he doesn't score enough but in reality he contributes goals consistently nearly every game, either directly assisting or providing space for others. He won't have the same attention at United and given the space I think he will really kick on and become a force, United have got a great deal here and I really hope to see Wilf fulfil his potential there. Obviously after helping us get promoted of course. Ant, CPFC The Follies Of The PL In reply to Nathan, the reason why the Spanish and French players have thrived in the EPL is the same reason why the Spain and France national teams have had more success than England over the past 15 years, far more technically gifted players. It doesnt make sense to me why the likes Zaha/Henderson/Wickham/Carroll have gone or are going for huge money when ya can pick up far better players in at least six leagues around the world for half the money. If I was Man City, the first signing I would make would be to get Benfica's and Porto's scouts. The players they pick up for pittance around the world every year and then sell on for huge profit while remaining very competitive themselves is astounding, and is surely the type of financial sustainability what FFP is looking to reward. MagnumPIG (10m on Coutinho is a waste however) French Hits And Flops In response to Nathan (in Arsene we trust...London), I don't think the French are necessarily the safest bets when it comes to picking foreign players for English clubs. A quick wikipedia search shows that they have been the most numerous imports, but as shown below in my (unofficial and completely biased) list of hits and flops, it's pretty 50-50 when it comes to success (I've only considered the best known players out of that wikipedia list): French hits: Cantona, Ginola, Cabaye, Sessegnon, Dugarry, Sagna, Clichy, Nasri, Henry, Vieira, Petit, Desailly, Leboeuf, Makll, Anelka, Darcheville, Distin, Gallas, Djorkaeff, Dumas, Givet, Grimandi, Kaboul, Legwinski, Malbranque, N'Zogbia, Pirs, Flamini, Queudrue, Laurent Robert, Saha, Silvestre (hesitate here but I guess he was a success for a while), Evra, Wiltord... French flops: Guivarc'h, Laurent Blanc (I'd say he actually flopped for ManU), Obertan, Pogba, Deschamps, Abou, Aliadire, Arphexad, Ba, Barthez, Bellion, Bonalair, Boumsong, Cheyrou, Christanval, Coquelin (so far), Cygan, Dacourt, Alou Diarra, Diomde, Goma, Kapo, Koscielny (so far), Diaby (same), Ferri, Le Tallec, Dalmat, Sinama-Pongolle, Marlet, N'Gog, Piquionne, Prunier (who can forget his appearances for ManU), Schillaci, Vignal... I would say Spain has a better success rate (very few outright flops). Wonder if the Scandinavian nations have been more successful too (they have a reputation of adapting well to life in the UK) Mike, Chelsea, based in Auckland Shouldn't We See Giant-Killing On TV? So, what a week it's been in the League Cup - and evidence of the excitement, unpredictable nature and drama of the domestic cups. Ok, so Man U didn't take it seriously, and it was Arsenal's fifth choice 'trophy', but there's no doubt that the big teams didn't go out purposefully to lose (high-scoring drama with Reading v Arsenal and Chelsea v Man Utd remember). So then we have the FA Cup. The biggest, most important domestic Cup in the UK, famous for giant-killing stories that trump those of Bradford. We have two prime opportunities for such stories tomorrow - Macclesfield v Wigan, and Norwich v Luton. Both unlikely to see under-dog victories, but we all hope to see one. Neutrals across the country, whilst their teams are having a break from league action, will be following these games with interest. Five matches have been chosen for Live TV coverage, and they feature the teams who almost every weekend, have a live game on TV - Man U, Man City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. Would it not have been nice, following such a great Cup week, to have followed this up with lunchtime TV games featuring the two potential giant-slaying games, or are we not bored of seeing the same players on TV every week? Maybe it's just me.. Adam Shortland (Luton Town...oh, that's why he wrote this) What About Villa? As I understand (correct me If I'm wrong), due to a hospital A&E in the Millwall area protesting tomorrow against closure, Millwall have moved their FA cup tie with Aston Villa to tonight (quite a nice gesture by both clubs to agree with). Instead of showing it on ITV or ITV2 they have decided upon Ray Mears, who shows how a slightly portly man can survive when face with perilous circumstances, and You've Been Framed, a collection of amusing mishaps caught on camera. I won't go too much into killing two birds with one stone, but as much as I subscribe to there being too much football on TV sometimes, (sometimes, but you can always change channel) why isn't this? It bloody annoys me to be honest, there's nothing better than a game of football on a Friday evening and a wee flutter, and before I get accused of being disrespectful, yes, I will be watching the AFCON match instead (Burkina Faso v Ethiopia), and there appears to be a Bundesliga game. It's just that I used to check the league fixtures to see if there was something to watch, whereas now I scan the TV channels to see IF it's being shown. It's the FA cup for God's sake, and just so I'm being fair, SKY have been guilty of this before when a League 1 or 2 match has been played but not shown. Just so you're aware, my local streams football like a rivulet and so the players move like Dimitar Berbatov, but that's not the point. On a Friday evening, if there is a match on I say it should be shown. I demand to be sated. Chris, ITFC, (Any tips on Burkina Faso v Ethiopia anyone?) Liverpool Villa's Best XI Under Lerner I wrote in after the League Cup debacle and vented my spleen about Villa and where it has all gone wrong. And as I prepare to go to Millwall tonight I find myself thinking about what could have been. And in order to torture myself more, I came up with a Villa first team that have all played for the club during Lerner's tenure. And it made me sad to think how good this team could be. Imagine a 4-2-3-1 GK - Friedel RB - Luke Young - probably the weakest position in the team, but still handy in his day. CB - Mellberg. CB - Laursen - with Mellberg, could you imagine a better looking centre-back pairing, makes me go weak at the knees. Rugged man beard of Olof and the golden haired, blue eyes of Laursen. I am in heaven. LB - Warnock - why is he wasting in the reserves when we have problems? CM - Gareth Barry - was our best player when he left. CM (Captain) - Stilyan Petrov - great leader, massive miss this season and really puts everything into perspective when you think about it. Seems like a genuinely decent guy as well. LW - Downing - player of the season when he left. CAM - Milner - definitely his best position in the middle of the park. RW - Young - annoying diving and all that, but still a massive talent. CF - Darren Bent - great finisher who is wasted at the moment with no service. I know why Lambert doesn't play him as he doesn't do much other than score, but in this team he wouldn't need to. Subs: Given Dunne Benteke Agbonlahor Sidwell - central midfield is a massive problem Albrighton Bannan Manager - Martin O'Neill of course. There isn't much point to this mail, other than maligning the combination of bad luck (Laursen's injury, Petrov's illness) bad management (Friedel was frozen out by Houllier, as was Warnock) and Lerner cashing in (Downing, Barry, Milner, Young).

720,"Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com. He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. David Price won the American League Cy Young Award in 2012, finishing with a 20-5 record and becoming the first AL East pitcher in nearly a decade to claim the league ERA title. See which teams are shelling out the highest MLB payrolls in 2013. But he scored an even bigger victory just before the end of the year: He beat the fiscal cliff. Even more intriguingly, he did so in a way that hinted at the possibility of a future trade. Not long before the clock struck midnight on New Year’s Eve, Price and the Tampa Bay Rays reached agreement on a one-year contract for 2013 worth slightly more than $10 million. The ingenuity of the team and Price’s agent, Bo McKinnis, was in the details. Price’s contract included an immediate $5 million signing bonus, a 2013 base salary near $1 million, and $4 million in deferred salary payable in 2014. Why is that breakdown significant? Well, remember what was going on in Washington, DC, at the time? Congress was working to avoid the fiscal cliff. Eventually, Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which raised the top federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. That obviously affected Price, who earned more than $4 million in base salary during the 2012 season. But wait. Only about 4 percent of MLB players are college graduates. See who's at the top of the class. By giving Price $5 million of his new contract right away, before the New Year began, it became income earned in 2012 — under the lower rate. For Price, the end result figures to be a federal income tax savings of roughly $230,000. When factoring in state taxes and the new Medicare surcharge, one expert said Price’s total savings will amount to $400,000. (While Florida does not have state income tax, the Rays play half of their games on the road, rendering that income taxable.) Apparently, it’s good to have an agent with a degree from Vanderbilt University’s Owen Graduate School of Management. There also was a clever wrinkle in this deal for the Rays: the $4 million in 2013 salary that will be deferred until 2014. Price is one of the best pitchers in baseball, but with each passing day it becomes less likely that the low-budget Rays will be able to sign him to a long-term extension. As evidenced by the trades of James Shields and Matt Garza in recent years, the franchise’s financial model doesn’t seem to permit carrying expensive starting pitchers. Because Price is set to become a free agent after the 2015 season, the Rays likely will need to trade him in the next 12 months if they want to maximize their return. (Acquiring teams generally want at least two years of control on a player in order to surrender elite prospects.) So, what’s the significance of that $4 million deferral? Because the Rays won’t pay that money before next winter, the collective bargaining agreement allows them to negotiate a way for Price’s (theoretical) new team to assume that obligation. In other words, the Rays could deal Price within the next year and end up paying only $6 million of the roughly $10 million he is owed on his 2013 contract. Just in case you weren’t convinced by three postseason appearances in five years, despite severe payroll disadvantages . . . Rays general manager Andrew Friedman is a very smart man. Price doesn’t have the biggest contract in baseball. But it’s very possible that he has the smartest. And it’s fitting: Price is a Vanderbilt guy, too.",Raw Data
721,"Tiger Woods may or may not be back — whatever that means — but throughout the longest of Sundays on the Southern California coast, he was once again the champion he used to be. Woods played 25 holes at a soggy Torrey Pines in 6-under par and, with 11 holes left in his final round at the Farmers Insurance Open, takes a commanding six-shot lead into the Monday finish. It’s been a virtuoso, vintage performance by Woods, who will surely win for the eighth time on a course he’s loved since he was a boy, and one that’s served to quiet wagging tongues. John Senden, a normally circumspect Australian with one Tour win, started Sunday four shots behind Woods, but didn’t think the tournament was over. “You really do never know what can happen,” he said. ""At the end of the day, as comfortable as he is, he's still a golfer just like us so anything is possible."" Anything may be possible, but it’s impossible to imagine a middle-of-the-pack player calling out Woods — “a golfer just like us” — four years ago. That he did speaks to how far the legend of Tiger Woods has been damaged since late 2009. The 14 majors and 13 years of otherworldly doings have become distant memories. In their place is the New Tiger, one who can still win, but — like the rest of them — only when it’s his week. While he won three times last year — second only to Rory McIlroy — Woods also faltered on the weekends at the year’s final three majors. Such vulnerability didn’t go unnoticed in the locker room. And so eyeballs were trained on Woods — even more than they usually are — on a chilly Sunday morning. He answered the bell. Woods started the day with a two-shot lead and quickly distanced himself from the peloton with a tap-in birdie on the second hole after expertly spinning a wedge off a ridge and then converted a two-and-a-half footer on the exacting par-3 third. He cruised along — three more birdies against a lone bogey — until the 18th, a par 5 he’s never bogeyed in 36 rounds at Torrey Pines. Woods’ drive found a corner in a fairway bunker, leaving him an awkward play and a mid-iron for his approach. He hit into the right greenside bunker but failed to convert an eight-footer for par; the only time he hasn’t gotten up-and-down from the sand in seven tries this week. His body language said that it wasn’t the way he wanted to finish, but he didn’t have time to fester because he was back on the first tee 30 minutes later. Woods’ first drive of the final round was, simply, horrendous. A quick pull hook that was closer to the sixth fairway than the hole he was playing. But there was something else I remember about Woods, back in the day: He didn’t need to be in the short grass at Torrey. He won here once despite finishing last in fairways hit. Certainly, the errant shot didn’t bother him; he calmly shaped an iron right-to-left, up and around a pine and found the putting surface, from where he safely two-putted. Woods made another ugly par on the second after going way left again off the tee, but then sunk a 15-footer on the third for birdie. On the fourth, with the Pacific Ocean on the left, Woods went well right. “That wasn’t left of the cliff,” he joked later, “You can hit it 400 yards to the right and still have a shot, so I was fine.” Fine’s a relative concept. Woods was stymied by a tree and could only punch a low shot toward the green. He came up well short of a tricky green. But then he chipped in for birdie. It was really a remarkable stretch of four holes. Good players, from where he’d hit the ball, could have been well over par. He was 2-under. And that’s the Tiger I remember, too. For good measure, Woods gouged a 5 wood out of the right rough on the sixth, a par 5, and found the green, leading to a ho-hum two-putt birdie to give him a six-shot lead as darkness fell. “It’s probably the whole package,” a tired Woods said later of what was working for him. “I’ve driven the ball well, I’ve hit my irons well, and I’ve chipped and putted well.” Though others have handed him the trophy, Woods knows there’s still work to do with defending champion Brandt Snedeker — whose putter can get very hot — and another former champion, Nick Watney, his closest pursuers. “I’ve got to continue with executing my game plan,” he said.",Raw Data
722,"This ought to be a ruinous time in Scottish soccer. With Rangers in the fourth tier and the national team in tatters, dark clouds should be packing together and starving the northern end of the British Isles of light, relegating its soccer scene to oblivion. When Rangers bankruptcy sent it to the Third Division, that was supposed to pretty much be it for serious professional football in Scotland. Overnight, broadcast rights for the Scottish Premier League were worthless, now that there was no more Old Firm played against Celtic four times a year. And when the money goes, the soccer follows out the door. As for the Scottish national team, manager Craig Levein was recently fired after the Scots took just two points from their first four World Cup Qualifiers, essentially eliminating them 20 months before the World Cup kicks off. It will be the fourth consecutive tournament they miss. They havent been to a Euro since 1996. Things are so bad that Scotland, ranked 70th in the world, was glad not to lose to bottom-feeders Luxembourg, ranked 144th in the world, in a friendly on Wednesday. They only won by a score of 2-1 against a team that usually celebrates when it loses by just a goal or three. But things are not as bad as all that. Solely because of Celtics European Cinderalla run. A club like Celtic, a giant domestically but inconsequential on the European stage, isnt supposed to be able to compete in the UEFA Champions League. Ahead of the season, most people would have told you they arent even worthy of being in the tournament, period. Celtic, like all Scottish clubs these days, is made up of scraps and spare parts. Free agent signings and loans and bargain pickups. Its payroll is laughable when laid next to the tournaments other entrants. Its spine of Fraser Forster, Efe Ambrose, Kris Commons, Victor Wanyama and Georgios Samaras cost less than 6 million pounds, according to the Guardian. The rest of the squad it got virtually for free. Grouped with world-beaters Barcelona, Spartak Moscow of the newly filthy-rich Russian league and Benfica, one of the best developers of talent in the world, Celtic stood no chance whatsoever, so the consensus rang out. But Celtic held Benfica to a 0-0 draw in its opening game. Nobody paid it much mind until Celtic overturned a 1-2 deficit with 20 minutes remaining into a 3-2 victory, courtesy of Samarass 90th-minute winner at Spartak. Suddenly, Celtic had four points from two. It was contending, sitting in second place in the group one of the spots that grant a place in the Round of 16. TEARS OF JOY Watch as Rod Stewart celebrates Celtic's historic win over Barca. Away to Barca, Celtic even had the temerity to go ahead on a Samaras goal in the 18th minute. It took an Andres Iniesta strike on the brink of half-time and a 94th-minute Jordi Alba goal to save Barcas expensive bacon. Surely Celtic would collapse in its second game against Barca. It couldnt withstand the sort of pressure Barca applied forever. And then it did. Hosting Barcelona, the Bhoys put on a defending clinic. They deftly covered one another and didnt succumb to endless fouling. Overall Celtic had just 16 per cent of possession and completed only 166 passes, as many as Barcas Xavi connected on by himself. Barca as a team completed 955 passes. But on Celtics sparse attacks, Wanyama thumped in a header off a corner in the 21st minute. And Tony Watt, just 18 years old, fresh off the bench, making his Champions League debut and newly acquired from Airdrie United for just 50,000 pounds, ripped a shot past Victor Valdes on a breakaway. Lionel Messi scored for Barca in the 91st minute. But the Catalans had no further retort. For all their dominance, Barca couldnt answer the Scottish willpower. Celtic defended courageously, seeing out a clock that seemed to tick only every ten seconds or so. A packed Parkhead heaved as 60,000 chanted and cheered and sang The Fields of Athenry, the Irish folk song adopted by the iconic Catholic club. They couldnt wait for the game to be over, but didnt want it to end, this precious moment of significance. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Scores | Stats | Standings More Champions League | Video Uber-fan Rod Stewart cried when the last whistle finally sounded. Celtic sits on seven points now, three more than Benfica, four more than Spartak. It has got two games remaining, against the aforementioned pair. If it holds on, it will be counted among the 16 best clubs in Europe. In the year of its supposed doom, Celtic has shone a light into the long, sinister tunnel facing Scottish soccer, like so many leagues that have had to fold in the games financial arms race. Their football might be relevant yet.",Raw Data
723,"For the first two months of the NBA season, the long awaited, supposedly bitter rivalry between the New York Knicks and their crosstown foes in Brooklyn wasn’t playing out like much of a rivalry at all. The Knicks were for the most part thriving while the Nets were unresponsive and faltering — to the point firing their coach became necessary. And, with 6-1/2 games already separating them after Brooklyn’s loss in Milwaukee on Dec. 26, the final game of Avery Johnson’s tenure as coach, all the hype promoting this can’t-miss “Battle for New York” felt like much ado about nothing. This town only had one true title contender, and Brooklyn wasn’t it. But after an 88-85 win at Madison Square Garden on Monday afternoon, the Nets (25-16) suddenly find themselves within a single game of the Knicks (25-14) in the Atlantic Division standings, and just 2-1/2 games behind the Eastern Conference-leading Miami Heat. And the memory of that punchline of a team that lost 10 of 13 after an 11-4 start has dissipated — a distant, unpleasant reminder of how bad things once were. “Our guys are obviously elated and they should be really proud,” Nets interim coach P.J. Carlesimo said. “I thought that our assistant coaches really had a good game plan, but a game plan is meaningless if the guys don’t execute it, and our guys made them work. That’s all you can do. Nothing came easy.” The Nets have thrived since Carlesimo took the reins from Johnson, going 11-2 since the former Blazers, Warriors, Sonics and Thunder head man took over. And with exactly half the season finished, they’ve taken themselves from the brink of the draft lottery to the middle of the hunt in the East, where seemingly anyone could emerge as No. 1. Many will point to Brooklyn’s favorable schedule since Carlesimo’s promotion as the source of its recent success — and, to be sure, the Nets haven’t exactly faced a murderer’s row of opponents, with wins over Charlotte, Cleveland, Washington, Sacramento, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Toronto dotting the landscape along the way. Additionally, blowout losses to Atlanta and San Antonio haven’t done the Nets any favors in the eyes of their detractors. But solid victories over the Pacers, Thunder and now a redemptive win over New York — which beat the Nets twice in December, once in a laugher — have shown this team’s ability to hang with the league’s best. And shooting guard Joe Johnson’s preseason proclamation that Brooklyn was the best team in the Big Apple is looking more legitimate by the day. “That’s not going to change,” Johnson said when asked if he still stood by his assertion. “Did today reinforce it? I don’t know. I thought we came out and played great basketball and definitely made a case.” In a contest when seemingly everyone on the Nets roster played well, Johnson was the star for Brooklyn, scoring 25 points, including an isolation jumper over J.R. Smith — who called a 2-2 season split with the Nets, “like kissing your sister” — to give Brooklyn an 85-84 lead with 22.3 seconds left to play. Johnson scored 10 consecutive points in the fourth quarter to keep the game within reach for the Nets and has come into his own under Carlesimo, averaging 18.6 points per game since Carlesimo took over. “Joe Johnson is a heck of a player,” Carlesimo said. “He’s a money player, and he’s been a money player his entire career. If he didn’t, somebody else probably could have stepped up too, but we all feel very comfortable when Joe’s got the ball in the fourth quarter.” Brook Lopez had 14 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks Monday, and Kris Humphries chipped in 11 points and 13 boards off the bench. Deron Williams, who previously called out Johnson’s system during the Nets’ dark days, had 14 points and 12 assists, and across the locker room, players were quick to give Carlesimo credit for the turnaround. “He’s been great, I think guys are responding well to him,” Williams said. “He’s different than a lot of coaches I’ve played for with his sense of humor and his sarcasm, but he’s been a straight shooter, he’s defined roles, and he’s done a great job of just leading this team. . . . I think, most importantly, our focus has been a lot better, our energy, our enthusiasm has been a lot better — not only in games, but overall, and I think that translates.” Now, is it possible that the Nets could have gone on this redemption tour under Johnson? Sure, but I wouldn’t necessarily guarantee it. Beyond its cupcake schedule, Brooklyn has seemingly played with a new sense of pride under Carlesimo while showing a previously lacking sense of commitment to the coach’s goal. It’s not necessarily a good look to give up on your coach when things turn south, but that’s what appears to have happened, and the Nets should be commended for stepping in and turning things around before an increasingly dire situation got worse. A tough three-game Western Conference road trip through Minnesota, Memphis and Houston beginning Wednesday will tell us a little bit more about the viability of the Nets as a true title contender, as will the subsequent homestand that includes games against Miami, Chicago and the Lakers. But in handling the Knicks on Monday, Brooklyn not only reignited a rivalry that was already in danger of becoming irrelevant — leaving us salivating over what a playoff series between the teams might be like. It also put the Nets back in the national discussion, somewhere no one expected them to be just a few short weeks ago. “We’ve put ourselves in a nice position, but it’s meaningless if we don’t build on it,” Carlesimo said. “I love where we’re at at the halfway point, but we’ve got to continue to build and we’ve got to get some guys healthy and not tired and keep getting a number of people contributing, which is what we’re getting right now.”",Raw Data

Quinton “Rampage” Jackson used the UFC on FOX 6 conference call on Tuesday to say his goodbyes, taunt and vent. “He’s just like the other guys I fought. He’s a coward,” Jackson said of Saturday’s opponent, Glover Teixeira. That was on the second question of the call. Other fighters on the UFC on FOX 6 card in Chicago also made their presence known, including a foul-mouthed Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone. But it was Jackson — in the final fight of a multi-fight UFC deal — who was the most outspoken. “I want to get this last UFC fight out of the way and enjoy myself as a free agent,” said Jackson, a former UFC light heavyweight champ. “I’m going to see who’s interested in me.” Previously, Jackson said that he wasn’t happy with the fighters he’d been matched up against or his compensation. Jackson added his apparent inability to wear Reebok, his apparel sponsor, into the Octagon as another reason he’s putting the UFC in the rearview. “I see other fighters sponsored by Nike. Why can’t I have Reebok?” Jackson said. “It’s stupid stuff like that. It’s not only about money. It’s about respect.” Many other professional sports have exclusive sponsorship deals that limit the brands their athletes can wear. While UFC does have exclusive deals in the beer category with Anheuser-Busch (Bud Light), the same is not confirmed for Nike. Jon Jones. Chael Sonnen. What more could you want? New episodes Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on FX. When emailed about Rampage's Reebok situation, a UFC spokesperson replied, “We work with apparel companies from all over the world through our approved partnership program. We’ve not yet been approached by Reebok on behalf of Rampage, but welcome the conversation. We do everything we can to support our athletes getting these types of sponsorships and will continue to do so moving forward.” As for future fights, Jackson said that UFC officials offered him a new contract, but he declined to re-sign. “I have been mad with the UFC for a long time,” Jackson said. “It’s turned me into a very negative person. I just want to be a positive person. I have to get rid of all the negativity in my life. I have to get rid of some friends ... some negative family members. I’m getting rid of UFC. “I think that they’re happy with me leaving, as well.” Beyond moving to another MMA organization, Rampage said boxing and maybe more movies were in his future. Later in the call, Cerrone got into it with Jackson-Winkeljohn MMA teammate Demetrious Johnson over which one would get the “Fight of the Night” bonus. “You better fight on a different card if you want that,” Cerrone said. When asked what type of fight to expect as he takes on Anthony Pettis, Cerrone frankly said he would ""go and throw the (expletive) down.""

725,"Speculation has been rife that Chelsea's Champions League-winning hero was set to quit Shanghai Shenhua after just six months in China, with a host of clubs linked with the Ivory Coast star. But Galatasaray have moved into pole position after making an offer to his current club, with a spokesperson for the Sports PR Company saying: ""They have made a formal bid for him."" It is understood a deal could be concluded as early as Sunday evening for the 34-year-old, amid reports he has agreed an 18-month contract. Turkish champions Galatasaray have already signed Inter Milan star Wesley Sneijder this month as they look to bolster their squad after reaching the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will face Schalke, and they have also been heavily linked with Manchester City defender Kolo Toure. Drogba's last act for Chelsea before joining Shenhua last summer was scoring the winning penalty in their final shootout triumph. Last month Drogba returned to train with his old club during the Chinese off-season in preparation for the African Nations Cup, in which he is currently competing in South Africa. FIFA rejected a special request from the striker for him to join a club on loan outside the transfer window, amid speculation linking him with Juventus, AC Milan and Liverpool, among others. Despite his protests to the contrary, reports persisted that Drogba's move to China had not worked out, largely due to boardroom wrangling. He signed a two-and-a-half-year deal at Shenhua, netting him around 250,000 a week and reuniting him with Nicolas Anelka. Anelka is on the verge of joining Juventus on a deal until the end of the season. There are conflicting reports about the precise nature of Drogba's move to Galatasaray, amid suggestions it would initially be a loan arrangement with an option to buy for around 8.5million.",Raw Data

Love the NFL Truths. Wish I knew football and cultural issues as well as you. Rush Your NFL Truths for Week 9: 10. It’s not a coincidence that Cam Newton made significant progress last week. A competitor is inspired by criticism. After throwing a game-changing, pick-6 interception in the fourth quarter on Sunday against the Bears, Newton marched the Panthers 53 yards in 11 plays for a go-ahead field goal. Panthers WR Steve Smith dropped a would-be, go-ahead TD catch. Smith also fell down on Newton’s pick-6. In the postgame news conference after the Panthers' 23-22 loss, Newton sounded and looked like a leader rather than a crybaby looking to deflect blame. Was he perfect on Sunday? No. When a teammate bailed him out with a fumble recovery in the end zone, Newton didn’t stick around to celebrate. He jogged to the bench and sat alone. Newton is a work in progress. But you can’t bake a cake without turning on the heat. Shielding Newton from the heat with bogus claims of racism will only stop Newton’s cake from rising. Football, like life, is a game that humbles its participants. Newton needs to be humbled. It will toughen and season him. Humility will make him a better player. It will make him respect the game and add urgency to his preparation. Everyone needs critics. They keep you honest and alert. They make you work harder. The people without a passionate band of critics are the people I don’t trust. 9. Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts are 4-3 and you don’t hear much hype around the No. 1 overall pick. Why? Screw it, let me ask the question everyone wants to know: Why is Robert Griffin III, whose Redskins are 3-5, getting more hype than Luck? Griffin has better stats. He’s completing a higher percentage of passes (66 to 55). He has a better TD-to-INT ratio (8-3 to 8-8). Also, Griffin plays on the east coast and Luck plays in flyover country. But, most important, Griffin has played a far more challenging schedule than Luck. In the last four weeks, the Redskins have lost to the Falcons, Giants and Steelers. The Colts have beaten the fraudulent Vikings, Packers, Browns and Titans. It’s going to be a long time before we know who the better QB is, Griffin or Luck. Hopefully we’re looking at a Manning-Brady situation and both rookie QBs are outstanding for a long time. 8. With 83 seconds to play, the ball on the Giants' 28 and three timeouts in its pocket, Dallas faced second-and-1 and somehow never ran the ball once to get a new set of downs. Cowboys coach Jason Garrett had QB Tony Romo throw the ball three straight times. Two fell incomplete, the last was picked off. You have to run the ball on third down. I don’t care if they know it’s coming. I don’t care that Felix Jones is unreliable and already had a critical fumble. Tony Boo Boo is unreliable, too. Tony Boo Boo threw four interceptions on Sunday. Jason Garrett is an idiot. 7. I’m normally against firing coaches midseason. It really serves no purpose. Plus, you could prevent some coach from having a Tom Coughlin-like recovery. But, I could make a strong case for canning Garrett, Andy Reid, Romeo Crennel, Norv Turner and Rex Ryan right now. Turner and Ryan could still turn things around. Might as well save their pink slips for January and play things out. The situation in Kansas City is hopeless. Vince Lombardi couldn’t fix what ails the Chiefs. Might as well let Romeo cement his legacy as one of the worst head coaches in recent NFL history. Reid and Garrett, I’d can ‘em now. Garrett can’t manage game situations and he’s contributed to Romo’s inconsistencies. Reid is the pass-happy version of Marty Schottenheimer. Reid’s act in Philly is stale. He’s a good coach who has stayed in one spot too long. Schottenheimer did 10 years in Kansas City and bounced. Reid has been in Philly for 14 years. Get Reid out of Philly before he subjects rookie QB Nick Foles to the kind of beating Michael Vick has endured the past two years. 6. I’m back in love with Big Ben and the Pittsburgh Steelers. If they beat the Giants this weekend, which I expect, Pittsburgh will be my favorite to win the Super Bowl. Pittsburgh’s last eight games are against Kansas City, Baltimore, Cleveland, Baltimore, San Diego, Dallas, Cincinnati and Cleveland. Pittsburgh could enter the postseason on an 11-game winning streak. I can’t imagine them losing more than two games the rest of the way. 5. There are three candidates for league MVP right now: 1. Matt Ryan; 2. J.J. Watt; 3. Peyton Manning. Ryan has to be the frontrunner as long as the Falcons remain undefeated. His performance in the wind at Philly was important. He’s not a “dome” QB tossing up stats away from the elements. Ryan was spectacular in tough conditions. Watt leads the league in sacks, has recovered two fumbles and has broken up 10 passes. He’s halfway to the most dominant defensive season since Ray Lewis owned the 2000 season. No offense to Marshall Faulk, but considering Ray’s Super Bowl performance that season, Ray should’ve been the MVP of the league in 2000. If Watt continues his marvelous play, I hope MVP voters don’t automatically vote for the QB with the best stats and regular-season record. I’m blown away by how good Manning has been this season. And I know I’m repeating myself from earlier this season, but I’m equally shocked that Peter King predicted Manning would be this good. If Ryan and the Falcons falter and lose two or three games, Manning is going to be the favorite to win this award. I won’t object, even if Watt finishes the season strong. 4. I’m not sure we’ve seen a team as bad as the Bears start 6-1. I don’t like teams with bad offensive lines and moody quarterbacks. The Bears can’t protect Jay Cutler and eventually that's going to catch up with them. The Carolina Panthers' front four owned Chicago on Sunday. If Steve Smith doesn’t slip and fall, the Bears lose at home to the Panthers. I see the 5-3 Packers winning the NFC North and the Bears backing into the playoffs at 10-6. Lovie Smith and Jay Cutler are going to stick around Chicago for a few more years and continue to do the same dance. 3. I still can’t believe Patriots guard Brian Waters is going to sit out the entire season. I expect Waters to play next season for the Cowboys or Texans, teams in his home state. The Patriots reportedly offered the 35-year-old Waters $4 million to play this season. He has chosen to sit out. My money is on Waters returning and putting together one, or perhaps even two, more Pro Bowl-caliber seasons. Waters is one of the most underrated offensive linemen of all time. He played in the shadow of Will Shields and Willie Roaf in Kansas City for years. He then got lost in the chaos and turmoil created by Scott Pioli’s arrival in KC. I’ve only seen two offensive guards play at a higher level than Waters when he was at his peak — John Hannah and Larry Allen. In 2004, when Kris Jenkins was still a beast for the Carolina Panthers, Waters put a clown suit on Jenkins, who had to leave the game with an injured shoulder. Waters is a Hall of Fame-caliber player who was never in the right situation to get the proper hype. 2. You can’t go wrong picking either Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein or Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o for the Heisman Trophy. I’m so tired of every top football award going to a quarterback or running back that I slightly prefer Te’o. Notre Dame is clearly winning football games with its defense. The Irish are in the hunt for the national championship because of the defense Te’o leads. What more does a defensive player have to do to win the Heisman Trophy? Regardless, whether K-State and ND win out, Klein and Te’o should remain at the top of most Heisman ballots. They’re the two most important players in college football. *1.* Big Game Bob Stoops should consider leaving Oklahoma and trying his hand in the NFL. He’s lost his college mojo. You’ll never convince me Stoops isn’t a great football coach. He’s hit a stretch of bad luck and has come up small in a series of big games. I like what Greg Schiano is doing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Jim Harbaugh obviously handled the transition from college to pros really well. Some NFL team should make a run at Bob Stoops.",Raw Data
727,"The Cowboys fired defensive coordinator Rob Ryan on Tuesday. Blame Robert Griffin III. This will not be in the press release. It is the truth. The Redskins quarterback beat the Cowboys on a single leg in the season finale. With another week of healing, RG3 barely had time to breathe against an obviously better Seattle defense. And so less than a week after promising anger and discomfort, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones landed on a target: The leader of his battered and ineffectual defense. The feeling around Valley Ranch was Ryan inherited a good defense from Wade Phillips that had not gotten better and, while there were injuries, there were playmakers left. These were Jones' own words. Translation: They were 8-8 and somebody had to pay. Jones had promised as much in an interview on the Cowboys flagship radio station last week. I can assure our fans this, that it is going to be very uncomfortable from my standpoint; its going to be very uncomfortable for the next few weeks and months at Valley Ranch, Jones said. This brought giggles from most in the league, and absolute belly laughs from longtime Cowboys watchers. Nobody is laughing any more. A week that began with firing running backs coach Skip Peete a big deal mostly for Peete continued with letting go of a Ryan brother. Firing Ryan two years into a three-year deal is a much bigger deal and a real sign that Jones patience level has run out. He had told me as much in the week leading up to the season finale against Washington. I asked if it was hard to be patient when the Redskins were finding a way to win with a rookie quarterback. He demurred, and I asked if he was losing patience period. Well now thats a different question, Jones said and then went on to admit that yes, he is finding it hard to be patient. It is hard watching these games unfold and what were doing and especially the way we are doing it we are doing it early in the ballgames the way we are playing, he said. When you know and figure what is at stake, a fumble, those kinds of things, it is a little bit of agony. In other words, he was feeling this way before Week 17. Getting beat by the Skins and their rookie quarterback, settling for yet another 8-8 season without playoffs then watching Seattle (with a rookie quarterback) beat Washington had to have dropped Jones patience level to zero. And he was not firing Cowboys coach Jason Garrett so . . . Does Ryan deserve to be dropped in the grease for this failure? Hardly. The Cowboys defense was without big-time playmakers like Sean Lee, lost for the season in October, and relying upon a very beat up DeMarcus Ware. He barely looked like himself in that Skins game. There certainly were more excuses on that side of the ball than offensively. This will make the next couple of days and weeks at Valley Ranch very interesting. More specifically, it will be interesting to see how uncomfortable, if at all, things get for Garrett. His job as head coach is safe but the same is not guaranteed for his role as play-calling offensive coordinator. Jones always insisted he wanted his coach to call plays on whatever side of the ball was his specialty but there are fair questions about Cowboys quarterback Tony Romos development, as well as clock management. So there is a chance, albeit a slim one, that Jones forces a coordinator on Garrett. If so, it will be more fallout from the loss to the Skins and a Jones patience level that has bottomed out.",Raw Data

''Any time you look at the PED situation, you look at the Lance Armstrong situation - you look at stuff like that, it's serious out there,'' Thomas said.

All inevitably fall under three categories: the banal (Edin Dzeko's 'Happy New Year'), the self-important (Balotelli's 'Why always me?' or James Beattie's 'Obvious') or the sad indictment of society's celebration of the lowest common intelligence (Dimitar Berbatov's 'Keep calm and pass me the ball'). When a man like Berbatov reduces himself to that, I think we all died a little inside. Such messages highlight footballers' obsession with the self. 'Pass ME the ball'. 'Why always ME?' We have created a game which worships the greedy and abuses the weak of character or unstable of mind. A game which mocks optimism and pisses all over hope. A game which has forgotten its role in society. With that in mind, it is little wonder that our players act as they do. On Sunday, Malian midfielder Seydou Keita revealed a t-shirt message upon being presented with the Man of the Match award following his country's game against Niger. Thankfully, this time things were a little different. 'Peace for Mali', it read. It was a simple message, but necessary. Since January 2012 there has been war in Mali, with a military organisation(MNLA) ousting President Toure in March 2012 in an effort to gain political autonomy for the north of the country. In reaction, Islamist groups (including a splinter group of Al-Qaeda) has been battling the MNLA. With Foreign Aid now invited to assist the country from the UK, USA and France, amongst others, Human Rights Watch has made claims in recent days that Malian security forces have been killing civilians as violence escalates further between the military and Islamist groups. Keita's message was a simple bid to plead to stop a conflict that has caused 2,000 deaths and 375,000 people to be displaced in a year, and shows little sign of abating. But what's all this 'real life' stuff from Keita, does he not realise that he is a footballer? Shouldn't he have been 'bantering' with his team mates after victory? Shouldn't his interview have been limited to ""taking each game as it comes"" and ""proud of the boys""? Well, perhaps Keita understands the importance of his role, and the difference he can make. His message was not composed through an obsession with the self, but in recognition of others. In January 2012, Keita became an Oxfam campaigner against starvation in Africa: ""If we act now we could save the lives of women and children who are always the first victims of food crises."" During last year's AFCON (which began shortly after the outbreak of war in Mali), Keita broke down in tears after his side reached the semi-finals: ""I'm appealing for people to stop. It's not normal, we don't do that. We need peace, we are all Malians."" And finally, on Monday, Keita reiterated his hope for peace. ""We felt set for kick-off. However, our thoughts and hearts are focused on the situation in Mali. We are thinking of our families and the entire nation. We have faith that peace will return, but cannot stop thinking of those back home."" Can you imagine such dignified and considered statements from many others in our game? So Wayne, how did you rate your performance today? ""I was very happy, but just wanted to take this chance to thank fans for watching at a time when all may not be well domestically"" ""Nice to hear your own fans booing you, that's loyal supporters."" Opposite reactions, different mentalities. One of those considers his own feelings to be superior of the watching (and paying) public, the other comprehends his responsibility and duty. And Keita's example is the exception rather than the rule. Football does matter to players, I understand that, but we cannot allow our game to become another victim of self-obsession. We have to regain the concept that Bill Shankly was wrong. It isn't a matter of life or death, or anywhere near as important. But neither is it 'just a game'. Jonathan Wilson recalls meeting an elderly man on the joyous streets of Mali's capital city Bamako in 2002, after the hosts had beaten Algeria to qualify for the quarter-finals. With a grin lighting up a craggy face, the man exclaimed, ""This is the best night since independence."" That's it, that's what I'm after, that's what football should do. Rather than cause arguments about diving, fights about bragging rights and the collective shaking of heads over a lack of patience or humility, football should inspire. It should provide escape from the strife of life. And that's it, that's what I'm after, that's what footballers should do. Rather than cause arguments and the collective shaking of heads over a lack of loyalty or common decency, footballers should appreciate the good they can do, the responsibilities they have and the difference they can make. The African Cup of Nations is a beautiful tournament because teams are often not playing simply for personal or collective glory, but instead playing for their people. Started in 1957 at a time when the continent was warped through colonisation, the tournament acts as a symbol of the stumbling march of Africa's progression. It has caused entire populations to demonstrate emotions of sadness, anger, amazement and joy at events that don't actually matter, thus allowing that necessary escape. Last year, Libya's team played for unity despite political in-fighting at home, a group passionate and proud to represent a free state. Zambia's players sobbed after their victory, dedicated to a squad decimated by a plane crash in 1993. Eight of the 16 nations competing in this year's AFCON are listed as having ongoing military conflict back home. Every team seems to have a back story, and almost every team has suffered adversity in order to simply take part. This is fairytale minus the twee Hollywood sentimentality. This year, that story is Keita's. As captain of his country, he recognises that millions of people will use the fortunes of a team as respite from the rigours of war through no fault of their own. He has used the publicity of the tournament to raise awareness (without watching the game, I wouldn't have thought to write the piece) and will hope to act as an ambassador for his nation. Sometimes, mercifully, footballers do get it right.",Raw Data
730,"1) Up for the Challenge For some reason, this year's World Club Challenge – the 14th on the bounce in this country, which is a pretty impressive record of consistency given rugby league's poor history of sticking with a concept – has taken a while to catch the imagination. Maybe it's familiarity breeding a little ennui – this will be the fifth appearance in the fixture in six years for Leeds, and their third against Melbourne Storm. Perhaps it's the fact that the Rhinos beat Manly last year, making it easy to forget that Australian clubs had won each of the previous three. But the sight of Craig Bellamy, Cameron Smith and Gareth Widdop sharing the top table at Monday's press conference in the Taverners at Headingley with Brian McDermott, Kevin Sinfield and Danny McGuire was a reminder of the potential treats that lie in store. Billy Slater, Ryan Hoffman, Brett Finch and Cooper Cronk were back at the Storm's hotel in the middle of Leeds. Jamie Peacock, Rob Burrow, Kallum Watkins and Ryan Hall were eating their lunch in the Carnegie cafe bar. The expensive new Headingley pitch will be graced by the cream of rugby league from either hemisphere, and under the famously competitive and grouchy Bellamy, the Storm never start a match anything other than fiercely determined to win. What's not to like? Reading Don McRae's fascinating, and occasionally hilarious, interview with McDermott cranks up the anticipation another notch. But the involvement of Bellamy, Slater, Smith and Cronk makes me pessimistic about the Rhinos' prospects of retaining their crown. There must also be questions about their buildup in the first three rounds of the Super League season – a decent opening hit-out against Hull, followed by a scrappy derby defeat in the mud at Castleford, and victory on cruise-control against Salford (I've not seen either of the last two games, so feel free to correct these second-hand conclusions below). There does not seem to have been a game of the quality or intensity of the defeat Leeds suffered at Wigan the week before their Manly triumph last year. In addition, there has been attrition – they have lost Zak Hardaker, who has rapidly become a key figure at full-back, and Ryan Bailey, who has risen to the World Club Challenge in the past. Sure, Melbourne haven't played a competition game this year, are missing several key members of last year's squad, and have to cope with the usual problems of acclimatising from late Victorian summer to lingering Yorkshire winter, in addition to a hostile Headingley crowd. But unpopularity will hardly be a new sensation for the Storm, who have grown accustomed to travelling north to Queensland or New South Wales as the bad guys every second week, whether because of their wrestling tactics or salary cap misdemeanours. Class acts such as Smith and Slater will rise to, rather than run from, the challenge. Leeds will need to match, and probably surpass, the quality and passion of their performance against Manly if they are to have any chance of another famous win. 2) Don't take it away It wouldn't be a World Club Challenge without a debate over the future of the fixture. A working-party would now appear to have settled on exporting the game to Australia (or New Zealand) this time next year, and then staging an expanded Challenge involving the top three clubs from each hemisphere in Europe in early 2015, with a view to taking the games on the road in future years. That all sounds pretty positive, but it does run the risk of squandering something that has shown such unusual durability. And not hosting the NRL champions next February will be a major loss. Isn't there any chance of having one game in each hemisphere next year? 3) Worth the Waite This is very un-rugby league, but I wanted to take a minute to soak up some of the good things that happened last weekend, and have largely been overlooked. If you didn't catch Sky's full-time highlights package or the Super League Show on the Beeb, check out Ben Cockayne's second try for Wakefield at London, or a couple of crackers from Josh Charnley and Jermaine McGillvary in Huddersfield's stirring win against Wigan. Jordan Tansey's performance at full-back for Castleford in defeat at Bradford offered huge promise for the Tigers, and even Salford scored two terrific tries in their latest drubbing at Leeds. It seems a little un-PC to say so, but I also loved the rather old-fashioned approach taken by the Catalan Dragons in their televised game at Warrington last Friday. ""Horribly messy,"" said the Wolves coach Tony Smith. But what does he expect? Are teams supposed to turn up and admire Warrington spreading the ball to the wings, as they do so well? He'd probably moan then, as well, about the lack of competitive games in the Super League. The Dragons decided to get among the Wolves, and see what happened. Olivier Elima was wonderfully niggly off the bench. Brent Webb played the part of pantomime villain to perfection, goading Ben Westwood on his way to a second stint in the sin bin. The loveable old rogue David Ferriol may have retired to his Limoux vineyard, but his spirit lives on. For that, I suspect we have David Waite, who has returned to Perpignan to assist the Catalans' new French coach Laurent Frayssinous, to thank. Waite, the Australian who became Great Britain's first overseas coach back in 2001, is urbane, intelligent and bilingual, although occasionally hard to understand in English, never mind French. He's also a pleasingly old-fashioned rugby league coach who has never been averse to sending his forwards out to cause a bit of mayhem. Très bien, Monsieur Waite. Encore. Meanwhile France's appointment of Richard Agar as coach of the national team for the World Cup also strikes me as a shrewd one – and it will need to be, given their tough draw in a group involving Samoa, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. But probably the most heartening thing I've read this week concerned another Brit who has coached the French, Bobbie Goulding. I've had my moments with Bobbie in recent years – in fact I don't think we're talking any more – but Ian Ridley's interview with him in last Saturday's Daily Mail suggested that the former Great Britain scrum-half is ready to put some tough years behind him, after showing the courage to seek professional help from the Sporting Chance network fronted by the Arsenal legend Tony Adams. 4) Child's play There is one more bouquet to deliver from the weekend, although it won't be popular, so it comes with a bit of a brickbat. James Child contributed hugely to the quality of Saturday's Huddersfield-Wigan game with a restrained, unobtrusive refereeing performance. Yet he still left the field to a chorus of boos at half-time, and the reaction to my suggestion on Twitter that he's had a good game – ""What a load of tripe"" – was depressingly predictable. Still, everyone is entitled to their opinion. What really irritates me is the witless, abusive and arrogant chant of ""You don't know what you're doing"" to which a minority of supporters so regularly resort. Perhaps it's wrong to be irritated – one can only admire their combination of faultlessness in their own professional lives, an exhaustive knowledge of the laws of rugby league, and perfect vision to know exactly what's going on from the back of the stand. Or maybe they're just hypocrites. Now I'm not saying the refs are perfect. Let's pick on Steve Ganson, because he's old and ugly enough not to be overly concerned: he didn't have his best game at Bradford last Saturday, with some really tough calls on Castleford. Similarly Sky's coverage confirmed that the early offside penalty that Richard Silverwood awarded against the Catalans at Warrington, thereby setting the tone for the early exchanges, was harsh. But does that mean they don't know what they're doing, or that anyone watching the game – whether from the terrace or the press box – has the right to hurl abuse on the assumption that he or she could do any better? Apparently, depressingly, yes. Modern society, I suppose. 5) Gimme five Right, we need cheering up after that lot. How about a Festival of World Cups? Launched in Leeds last Wednesday, this is, slightly confusingly, only tangentially linked to the main Rugby League World Cup that will be staged in the UK and Europe this autumn. There will be five more lower-case rugby league World Cups held before that, during a two-week period in July: for women, students and police in Yorkshire; for the armed forces in Colchester; and for wheelchair rugby league in Gillingham, the stronghold of the Medway Dragons amateur club. We'll try to provide regular details of the build-up to those competitions in the coming months. Any contributions below the line would be very welcome. It's your forum, and I know regular bloggers would be interested to learn more. 6) Global grafters There's much more upbeat stuff to rattle through in tackle six. The University of Gloucestershire All Golds have just been crowned national student champions, defeating Loughborough University, one of the traditional powerhouses of the student game, in the final. That's a perfect boost to the ambitious All Golds ahead of their entry into the new semi-professional Championship One competition – and they have also signed a partnership deal with the Bristol Sonics, who operate a couple of levels down in the Conference League South. With the World Cup coming to Bristol, when the Cook Islands face the USA at the Memorial Stadium in October, there is a feeling of momentum in the south-west. Three schools from the rugby hotbed of Gloucester – St Peter's High, Churchdown and Chosen Hill – were also represented at the Midlands finals day in the Carnegie Champion Schools competition, with three from Derbyshire and others from Telford and Wolverhampton. Small acorns, but hugely heartening all the same. Meanwhile, Warrington have hosted a delegation from Deutschland Rugby League, Ukraine has a clutch of newly-qualified coaches and referees, and Lebanon's under-18s gained revenge on Saudi Arabia. All these developments, both nationally and internationally, are almost entirely reliant on the enthusiasm of league nuts from either Australia, England or both. That's a long way from the superstars of Melbourne and Leeds, where we came in. But unsung heroes, the lot of them.",Raw Data
731,"Days after Nike Golf debuted its new dynamic duo in a special effects-laden television ad, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy both shockingly missed the cut in their season-opening tournament. In what’s believed to be only the fifth time the world’s top-two ranked players have exited early at the same tournament, the Swoosh’s stars swooned in the Abu Dhabi Championship on Friday. It was a black day for both players, who have much on the line this year, and for Nike, which has gambled $150 million on McIlroy succeeding Woods in the long-term as golf’s biggest star. And it can’t have felt good, either, for the sheikhs who paid Woods $3 million to show and about half that to secure McIlroy’s appearance. Woods doesn’t come cheaply, but he’s usually very good value for his money, never before missing a cut when he’s been paid to appear. Indeed, this was the first time in 22 regular European Tour events — eight of which he’s won — that he won’t be playing on the weekend. Much will be made of the fact that a two-shot penalty incurred during Friday’s second round — for a seemingly innocent mistake — led to Woods missing the cut by a single stroke. After consulting with playing partner Martin Kaymer, Woods took relief from an embedded lie not knowing that such relief isn’t free on sand. Neither Kaymer, nor McIlroy, who was the third in the featured group, knew the rule, either. But blaming his early exit on the penalty ignores that he was so sloppy that those two shots carried such weight. In what is a big year in Woods’ career — he’s now 37 with a major drought entering its fifth year — I expected him to start his season with bang. If he was disappointed in Abu Dhabi last year when he couldn’t overcome English journeyman Robert Rock in the final round, what to make of this year’s debut? Woods looked like a man who wasn’t very prepared and hasn’t played a lot of golf since his World Challenge in early December. His tee shots, often with three wood, were all over the desert — he hit just 11-of-28 fairways in his two rounds — while his powers of recovery just aren’t what they once were. He turned in 41 on the front nine on Friday. That’s not very good. Woods did make a game of it on the back, firing four birdies — including three in a row — but inaccuracy on the 17th led to a bogey and then on the closing hole, his 20-footer for the birdie that would’ve given him a Saturday starting time came up short. ""I didn't hit it particularly well,'' Woods conceded. ""I putted great but just didn't hit it very good. I was struggling with that. I fought hard. “Got off to a bad start and I battled back and got it to where I thought I could play the weekend, and thought I might have a chance, just post two low rounds. But I won't be able to do that.” While Woods will quickly have the chance to redeem himself — he opens his PGA Tour season next week at his beloved Torrey Pines in the Farmers Insurance Open — McIlroy has no such chance. He’s scheduled the next four weeks off and no doubt will be enduring a lot of speculation about his Middle Eastern capitulation. Many questioned the wisdom of the 23-year-old abandoning the equipment that got him to No. 1 in favor of Nike’s deep pockets. He was more crooked than Woods with his new Nike clubs, especially off the tee. Not surprisingly, the Northern Irishman admitted that he was rusty and said the fault for his matching rounds of 75 lay more with “the Indian than the arrows.” Perhaps that’s true, but it didn’t go unnoticed that after just one day of using a Nike putter, McIlroy went back to his Scotty Cameron Titleist putter. He explained that the Nike putter was better on faster greens, but it was clearly a touchy subject when reporters pressed him on the change. ""I'm not here to talk about my contract. I'm here to talk about my golf,” he said, “And today it wasn't so good.”",Raw Data

The burning embers of the Twin Towers had a way of being invoked when a particularly dicey part of the Patriot Act needed selling 11 years ago. Kasandra Perkins and Jovan Belcher would be alive if there had been no handgun in their home, Jason Whitlock says. This was the smart play. Watering down constitutional rights is not easily undertaken. So scaring Americans and then using that fear to explain why this egregious assault on their rights is for their own good is genius. This is exactly why the right protecting against unreasonable searches and seizures of Americans is no longer absolute, thanks to the Patriot Act, and a right to a speedy and public trial by jury was only days ago finally reaffirmed in the Senate, with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) so eloquently arguing, “If we relinquish our rights because of fear, what is it exactly, then, we are fighting for?” Yes, tragedy is a dangerous time for the Bill of Rights because somebody is always there to wave a flag or an orphaned baby and use that to explain why we need to voluntarily give up rights our Founding Fathers so wisely gave to us. And so it is with this Jovan Belcher tragedy. The Kansas City Chiefs linebacker gunned down his girlfriend — the mother of his baby — and then killed himself, leaving a 3-month-old girl without parents. That this is a tragedy is inarguable. That this is some sort of referendum on the Second Amendment and our right to bear arms is absurd. My esteemed colleague, Jason Whitlock, argued just that in a very thoughtful column, noting “What I believe is, if (Belcher) didn’t possess/own a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today.” NBC analyst Bob Costas used this as a jumping off point to proselytize during halftime of “Football Night in America” about perspective in sports and the dangers of guns. The problem with intelligent, impassioned, well-reasoned arguments is how seductive they are. It is easier to blow off the crazy guy screaming “ban all guns” than journalists such as Whitlock or Costas who are arguing rather convincingly how the Second Amendment threatens our liberty rather than enhances it. What I know for sure is the distinguished senator from Kentucky is right. And his impassioned defense of the Sixth Amendment on the Senate floor last week needs to be Googled and viewed by everybody calling for a gun ban in response to the Belcher tragedy. “We have nothing to fear that should cause us to relinquish our rights as free men and women,” Paul said. “I urge my colleagues to reject fear, to reject the siren call for ever more powerful government.” This is not simply about guns. This is about rights. It is a slippery slope from doing something in the interest of public safety to giving up what we hold dear. The slope is greased with fear, with a self-righteous belief that we know better than the framers of the Constitution. And it is all based on informal fallacy. The idea that if we just ban all guns Kasandra Perkins does not die and a 3-month-old baby is not orphaned is the very essence of a stated premise that fails to support its proposed conclusion. Yes, guns are dangerous and people such as Belcher sometimes use them to do awful things. What I believe in my heart is Jovan Belcher was going to find a way to wreak havoc that day whether he had a gun or a knife or only his fists. And even the potential to stop him is not justification for willingly handing over rights guaranteed to us. If this makes me a gun nut or a wing nut or a preachy PITA, I am OK with those labels. Although, I prefer Constitutionalist. There are not a lot of us left — not absolutists, at least. Conservatives argue for limiting the right to a speedy trial because terrorists are dangerous. Liberals argue for taking away my right to bear arms because people like Belcher use them in unspeakably horrific ways. Hell, the mayor of New York wants to take away my right to buy a big cup of Coke while in his city because obesity has become such an epidemic. Where does it end? Taking away free speech, freedom of the press? Restricting our right to peaceably assemble? Whittling away our very liberty? Democracy means the majority decides what rules govern us. Liberty is the idea that we all have certain rights that cannot be taken away, not even by a majority. These are the “inalienable rights” of the Declaration of Independence, and when we give them up voluntarily, for whatever reason no matter how altruistic, what we find is all we have done is given more rights to the government that were intended for us. Doing so makes us less safe, not more. So I absolutely believe in “a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed” just as I do the right to a trial by jury and freedom of religion. And as tragic as this Belcher murder-suicide story is, as much as my heart breaks for that little girl, the answer is not taking away or willingly giving up the right of Americans to bear arms. Because if we give up our liberty for the mirage of safety, what really have we won?",Raw Data
733,"ARLINGTON, Texas A euphoric group Texas A&M players had congregated in perfectly symmetrical lines in the corner of the end zone at JerryWorld. Arms locked, swaying, per tradition as the Aggie War Hymn played and The 12th Man sang in unison. It was one of those amazing scenes you only get from college football. And it was at this moment quarterback Johnny Manziel executed his best run, sprinting from his postgame TV interview duties to join his teammates just at The Fighting Aggie Band had reached the ""saw Varsity's horns off, saw Varsity's horns off"" portion of the presentation. For all of y'all not from Texas, ""Varsity"" is the University of Texas, and beating The Longhorns biggest rival in Oklahoma, 41-13, in this Cotton Bowl felt almost as good as taking a saw to Bevo. Especially because, afterward, Sooner Nation had to tip their caps and admit they had been Johnny Football-ed. ""He's the best player I think I've ever played,"" Sooners defensive coordinator Mike Stoops said. ""He's got magic in him. He'll have a chance to win four of them Heismans if he stays healthy."" For any of y'all who did not have a Manziel crush on Johnny Football before A&M's Cotton Bowl W, welcome aboard. A few quick things: This is not simply about his stats, although that is where most will focus. Yes, the redshirt freshman helped A&M to 7,000 yards this season, a first by an SEC team. Yes, in this win, he rushed for 229 yards and two TDS, and passed for another 287 yards and two more TDs. Yes, he had a huge role in beating Alabama and getting them to this game. Yes, he won the Heisman. These are just numbers and awards. The impact of Johnny Football, the real impact, is much bigger and much harder to quantify, especially if you are not from around here. What Johnny Friggin' Football did was justifiy The SECession of A&M from The Big 12 this season, provided a solid slap to this four-team playoff The BcS plans to unleash on us in a year, re-established Aggie dominance in the fight for football hearts and minds in Texas and even provided fair warning for Oregon coach Chip Kelly. Can a single kid, a freshman at that, do all of this? Yes he can. So you start with Johnny, you have to start with Johnny because he is the catalyst. A&M athletic director Eric Hyman tells a story about the first time he watched the Aggies practice. It was August. He had just taken the job, coming from South Carolina in the SEC. So did he think A&M had what it took to compete in that league? He looked at the defense and he thought about a Prozac prescription. Then he looked at the offense and thought ""damn,"" as in wow. He told Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin that he really liked this quarterback. It was at this point Sumlin told him that was the backup. He then pointed to the slightly smallish kid wearing No. 2 and said, ""That is our starter."" In the coming weeks and months, he came to appreciate the kid who played the game like a video game. What he did Friday, slaloming through the Sooner defenders and tip-toeing along the sideline, was very much what he did all year. Only better. And by doing so, he pumped life into what has otherwise been an yawn-fest of a BCS bowl season. Anybody want to defend no playoff now? We had a chance for an Oregon-A&M shootout in a playoff game with that winner possibly facing the winner of 'Bama Notre Dame, or any of the delicious other possibilities that come with an eight-team playoff. ""We knew what the rules were before the season. You have your schedule. You play your games. You try to win 'em all. That's the way college football is set up right now,"" Sumlin said, artfully dodging if he wished for a playoff considering how well his team is playing. ""That means every game you play is important."" Well, every game except the last one. ""The way things are set up now, no, there's no reason to ask (what if),"" Sumlin said. Instead we watched Oregon pound Kansas State and Louisville beat Florida and yet another beat-down of Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl. Can we just let them win one? So in a bowl season marred by mostly boring, inconsequential, noncompetitive games played in front of blackmailed fans and universities and empty seats, the Cotton Bowl was a bright shining star. It was packed. It was electric. It was not competitive after halftime. A quick word on Oklahoma and more specifically coach Bob Stoops: He got clowned. His short staccato answers afterward revealed his embarrassment that Big Game Bob has gone from a nickname to a punch line. And herein lies the lesson for Kelly and possibly 'Bama coach Nick Saban as well. Leave. Leave now. Because Stoops used to be Kelly, a highly coveted college coach, mentioned for various NFL openings and this Dallas Cowboys job in particular. He stayed because Sooner Nation loved him. What he has learned is love is fleeting, and absence not permanence fuels desire. And just like in all levels of football, you are only as good as your quarterback. He also got Johnny Football-ed. We all did really. Coming into this season, virtually nobody thought A&M was going to be competitive in its first season in the SEC. They were giggling from Tuscaloosa to Death Valley. ""You know when I went to SEC media days hearing all that negative talk about how they didn't think we were going to be able to compete,"" Aggie offensive lineman Luke Joeckel said. ""Me and the other guys that came back went to the weight room, went to the field and told everybody and put a chip on the entire team's shoulder to prove them all wrong."" It was not just at SEC media days. Varsity was giggling, too. The thought in Austin was they had screwed up in College Station. They were stepping into an arena in which they could not compete. They were destined to be No. 2 in Texas for a while. Absolutely, the Aggie players, coaches, administrators and fans were thinking about this as they swayed in the corner of the end zone and ""goodbye to Texas university, so long to the orange and white"" just as the quarterback the 'Horns passed on joined them. They, too, had been Johnny Footballed.",Raw Data

Nowitzki has 24,375 career points, seven ahead of Iverson. Patrick Ewing is 17th at 24,815. Nowitzki stopped another Phoenix run in the fourth with a 3-pointer after the Suns had pulled within five, sparking a 10-0 run that put Dallas ahead 91-76. Brandan Wright, who entered just seconds earlier after sitting four straight games, converted a three-point play and Vince Carter hit two free throws before getting a steal that turned into a layup by Dahntay Jones. ""I'm starting to feel better,"" said Nowitzki, who missed the first 27 games after knee surgery. ""I have a little more pop on my jump shot. I have a little more lift."" Wright was the fourth center used by coach Rick Carlisle, who decided to give rookie Bernard James his first career start. Wright's three-point play put Dallas' lead back in double digits for good with 10:30 remaining. The lead was 17 with about 5 minutes left when Marion stripped a driving Dragic, and Darren Collison flipped the ball to Jones for an easy dunk and a 102-83 lead for the Mavericks, who are still on the outside of the playoff picture heading into a four-game road trip that ends in Oklahoma City. ""Honestly, this was as close to a must win as we have in the regular season,"" Nowitzki said. Elton Brand played his 900th career game and finished with 12 points for Dallas. The Mavericks, who had their eighth straight game with at least five double-figure scorers, had four different players score during an 11-0 run bridging the first and second quarters. Nowitzki hit a jumper, Carter and Rodrigue Beaubois had consecutive 3-pointers and Jones converted a three-point play for a 38-21 lead. Dallas pushed the lead out to 46-26 on a layup from Chris Kaman and back-to-back buckets by Marion, who had six straight points in the second and finished the half with a game-high 12. Collison, whose streak of 16 straight double-figure games ended, was scoreless on just one shot attempt in the first half but led Dallas with four assists before halftime. The Suns settled for a lot of long jumpers and shot 38 percent in the first half, going 1 for 9 from 3-point range. Luis Scola finished with 14 points for Phoenix, while Michael Beasley and P.J. Tucker had 12 apiece. ""When you put yourself in a hole like that and you finally dig yourself out, to sustain it takes a lot out of you,"" said Hunter, who fell to 2-2 since replacing Alvin Gentry. ""We just couldn't sustain it."" NOTES: Most of the game was played with a two-man officiating crew after Leroy Richardson strained his right calf early in the first quarter and didn't return. ... The Mavericks decided to keep veteran G Mike James at the end of his second 10-day contract, which guarantees his contract for the rest of the season. He played just 1:28 of the fourth with the outcome settled. ... Eight of the Suns' first nine games under Hunter will be part of a back-to-back set. ... James' start made it the 17th different starting lineup for Dallas this season.",Raw Data
736,"Reshanda Gray scored 19 points and sparked a big run in the second half before leaving with a left hamstring injury, Layshia Clarendon added 23 and California beat Utah 71-54 on Sunday. ''That's what we're about, let's find a way and get it done,'' Gottlieb said. ''That was obviously the shift in the game when we upped the pressure, got a bunch of steals and made plays the way we like to.'' Afure Jemerigbe scored 10 points while guard Eliza Pierre had five points, four assists and eight rebounds while playing the post position at the top of Cal's smothering press in the second half. That helped the Bears to their seventh consecutive win over the Utes and assures Cal (17-2, 7-1 Pac-12) of keeping at least a share of first place in the conference. ''We were fighting for something. We were fighting for our season,'' Pierre said. The Bears had trouble getting anything going against Utah's triangle-and-two defense until Gray scored 11 points as part of a 17-4 run midway through the second half. Gray, who also had eight rebounds, sat out the final 4:22 with an ice bag on her leg after straining her left hamstring. Cal was already without forward Gennifer Brandon, who injured her right foot in Friday's win over No. 20 Colorado. Guard Brittany Boyd also came up limping on the same play that Gray strained her hamstring on. It didn't matter. Utah committed 21 turnovers, including six in seven possessions after Cal made the defensive switch and went to the full-court press. ''That's normally a strength of our team,'' Utes coach Anthony Levrets said. ''We were tired ... and when you're tired like that sometimes that can overwhelm you, and it did tonight.'' Michelle Plouffe scored 19 points and Paige Crozon added 13 for Utah (10-9, 1-7). The Utes played without second-leading scorer Taryn Wicijowski who injured her right knee while attempting a layup in the first half of Friday's loss to Stanford. She's scheduled to undergo an MRI in Salt Lake City on Monday. Brandon's absence was even more noticeable. Cal struggled getting the ball inside against Utah's compact defense and was forced to settle for mid-range shots until Gray took over with 13 minutes left. She had 11 points during the big run by the Bears in the second half then later scored on a layup with 6:23 remaining to put Cal up 60-48. Gray then limped off the court less than 2 minutes later. The Utes, who haven't defeated the Bears since 1988, stayed close in the first half despite another strong game from Clarendon. Clarendon had four points during a 13-3 run midway through the first half then later made a 3-pointer that gave Cal a 32-23 lead with 1:03 left. That put Clarendon over 1,500 points for her career. Crozon cut the gap to 32-28 at halftime with two free throws and a 3-pointer just before the buzzer. Utah's freshman guard didn't miss in the first half, making all four shots from the floor - including 3-for-3 on 3s - and had 13 points before the break. The win leaves Gottlieb two shy of 100 for her career.",Raw Data
737,"Each FOXSports.com fantasy contributor shared three-to-five fantasy baseball sleepers to keep an eye on heading into owners' fantasy baseball drafts. Over the next two months, expect several updates to our positional fantasy baseball first base rankings. Ryan Howard, Phillies – The perils are clear-cut and genuine: rising age (turned 33 this offseason), an accretion of injuries and declining performance (a career-worst .219/.295/.423 slash last year). Yet Howard still possesses one of the more powerful strokes in the league, evidenced by 14 homers in 71 games, and his 27.5 home-run-to-fly-ball percentage was his best showing since 2008. Moreover, while hitting .280 is a pipedream, his 25.6 line-drive percentage states Howard’s putrid 2012 batting average was a product of bad luck. If Howard can notch 140 games, it’s easy to envision production along the lines of 30 jacks, 100 RBI and 80 runs. For the 20-something ranked first baseman, that’s one of the better selection values in your draft. Ike Davis, Mets – It was a tale of two seasons for the Metropolitan first baseman: Pre All-Star: 295 PA, 12 HR, 49 RBI, 30 R, .201/.271/.388 Post All-Star: 289 PA, 20 HR, 41 RBI, 36 R, .255/.346/.542 Davis’ 20 second-half home runs were the second-most in the Senior Circuit last season, and his 32 total long balls were tied for fifth-best in the league. Alas, most owners will see the seasonal slash of .227/.308/.462 and scoff. Make no mistake, home is not where the heart is for Davis, as he was stuck on the interstate in 77 games at Citi Field (.188 average) with only a third of his taters (11) coming in the Big Apple. Yet in 183 career games before 2012, Davis posted a .271 batting mark, meaning that average should see improvement in 2013. Replicating the round-tripper output might be a stretch, though turning just 26 years old in March, the best should be yet to come for Davis. Adam LaRoche, Nationals – Seems to be an overriding sentiment that LaRoche’s 2012 feats (.271/.343/.510, 33 homers, 100 RBI, 76 runs) were an aberration. Yet, subtracting his injury-filled 2011 campaign, LaRoche submitted similar figures from 2008 to 2010, with an average harvest of 25 blasts, 89 ribbies, 73 runs and a line of .269/.339/.485. Better yet, projected to bat in the heart of Washington’s dynamic lineup, no reason to believe the run and RBI yield will lapse. With Michael Morse no longer suiting up in our nation’s capital, LaRoche has top-12 potential. Adam Dunn, White Sox - Yes, the average is so abysmal that it negates his 16.2 walk rate. Yet, in formats where batting marks are not scored, it’s hard to ignore last year’s 41 homers, 96 RBI and 87 runs. Suppose their remains suspicion from Dunn’s infamous 2011 output (.159/.292/.277 in 122 games), yet the Windy City slugger’s rushed return from an early-season emergency appendectomy was probably the catalyst for this lethargic showing. Dunn’s mean output from 2004 to 2010 further illustrates this anomaly, with the Big Donkey brandishing a line of .253/.381/.533 l with 40 dingers, 101 RBI and 94 runs. Likely to be available near the end of your draft, Dunn offers great value for a backup first baseman or starting utility player. Brandon Belt, SF - I’ll apply the “post-hype” sleeper tag to Belt this season. The 24-year-old former fantasy “Next Big Thin” posted strong numbers in his first full season of play. Belt struggled during his 2011 introduction to San Francisco, but settled into a groove last year. He batted .275 with 40 extra-base hits and 56 RBI while stealing 12 bases. Most importantly, Belt picked up his production markedly in the second half of the season, boosting his batting average by 39 points. He also batted .315 at home, a full 78 points higher than his road mark. Obviously, the huge power alleys in San Francisco will hold his power output down, but it’s clear that he’s just finding his stroke. Brett Wallace, HOU - Wallace has long been on the fantasy radar, appearing on “sleeper” and “breakthrough” lists throughout minor league career. He produced solid numbers as a member of the Astros in 2012, his third taste of major league pitching. Wallace batted .253 with 20 extra-base hits and 24 RBI in 229 at-bats last season. Unfortunately, the former first-round pick by the Cardinals also struck out every 3.14 at-bats (insert your Pi joke here). Wallace generated a .372 BABIP for the Astros last season. His high strikeout rate remains problematic, but Wallace is just now entering his power prime. Wallace will serve primarily as the DH for Houston this season while logging some at-bats at first base to spell Carlos Pena. I’m curious to see whether it finally clicks for Wallace. Justin Morneau, MIN - Can you label a former league MVP as a true “sleeper?” I believe that based on the prevailing concern about Morneau’s health and his early draft status, he represents a “value” play, at a minimum. Therefore, I’ll take some liberty in adding Morneau to the back of this list. Morneau appeared in 134 games last season, producing 47 extra-base hits (19 home runs) with 77 RBI. His second-half batting average was 43 points higher than his first-half effort, and his power numbers stayed consistent. Morneau enters the final year of his contract without the concerns of surgery and rehabilitation of the past several seasons. He’s a career .280 hitter with three 30-home run seasons on his resume. Brandon Moss, OAK - I don’t discount the presence of Chris Carter and Daric Barton. I simply can’t dismiss a slugger that tore the cover off the ball in one-half of a season in Oakland. Moss slammed 39 extra-base hits, including 20 home runs, with 52 RBI in 265 at-bats. Granted, he also struck out 90 times (one per 2.94 at-bats). I believe you know where I’m headed with this analysis. Moss posted a ridiculous .440 BABIP to yield his .291 season batting average. He’s also expected to see at-bats in the outfield. Eric Hosmer, Royals - Sophomore slumps are nothing new in sports. Hosmer experienced his last season. In 24 more games played (compared to 2011), the first baseman produced fewer runs (65), hits (124), doubles (22), triples (2), home runs (14), and runs batted in (60). There are some whispers that a shoulder injury (rotator cuff, no surgery) was partially to blame for his paltry .232 batting average. I’m interested to learn where Hosmer falls in 2013 fantasy baseball mock drafts. Once FOXSports.com’s mock draft engine is turned on (coming in February), I’ll be sure to dig into the data to learn his 2013 average draft position. Owners may be able to steal this first baseman in later rounds. Previous stats indicate this guy possesses the ability to hit .275 with 20 home runs, 80 RBI and 20 stolen bases. Anthony Rizzo, Cubs - Bryan LaHair shocked everybody with his hot, All-Star-worthy start to the 2012 season. While the late bloomer mashed in the big leagues, the Cubbies’ first-base prospect, Anthony Rizzo, tore the cover off the ball at Triple-A Iowa. Rizzo, a top prospect dealt by the Red Sox and Padres, hit .342 with an OBP over .400 and 23 home runs in 70 games. After LaHair’s in-season meltdown (he hit .202 after the All-Star break), Rizzo won the first-base gig and hit .285 with 15 home runs in 87 games the rest of the season. One glaring weakness is Rizzo against lefties. He hit .208 with an OBP of .243 against southpaws. Still, because of the hype and prospect love surrounding this guy, expect Rizzo to be selected as a middle-tier first basemen. Ike Davis, Mets - Fantasy owners want to love Ike Davis. Heading into the 2011 season, the Mets first basemen looked to build on his 2010 freshman resume of 73 runs, 19 home runs and 71 RBI, but only managed to play in 36 games due to an ankle injury. Last spring training, Davis was diagnosed with the fungal infection known as “Valley Fever.” The good news was he only missed six regular-season games in 2012. The bad news was 240 of his at bats came at Citi Field where he hit .188 with a .277 OBP. Away from his home field, Davis hit 21 of his 32 home runs with a .262 batting average. Also worth noting that after posting a .201 BA in the first half of the season, Davis hit at a .255 clip during the second half with 20 home runs to finish the 2012 season. Allen Craig, Cardinals - According to my rankings, there is a severe tier drop (pun intended) after Craig. He had an injury-filled 2012 season (knee surgery, hamstring injury, and chest discomfort) yet still managed 22 HRs, 92 RBI, and a .307 AVG in 119 games. Since 2010, Craig has improved in almost all statistical categories. Yonder Alonso, Padres - First base is supposed to be a team’s power source, but it’s difficult when you play in an unfriendly home run ballpark. Petco Park surrendered .62 HRs per game (28th). He may have only finished with nine homers, but he tallied 39 doubles (fifth among other first basemen). Alonso also wrapped up 2012 with a .273 AVG (top 10 of first baseman). If you look deeper into Yonder’s stats, you’ll also see that he’s a clutch hitter. His best batting average comes when there are runners on first (.343) or runners on second and third (.333). So, even though the Padres only scored 651 runs last year (about four runs per game), Alonso took advantage of his opportunities. Chris Davis, Orioles - Yes, this is the same Chris Davis that is known for his strikeouts (both swinging and pitching). In 2009, he struck out every 2.6 at-bats (391 ABs). Since joining Baltimore, he has improved to a K/3 plate appearances (515 ABs). His organization also put a great deal of confidence into the slugger. In the offseason, they dealt Mark Reynolds to Cleveland and signed Davis to a one year $3.3 million contract. Last season, Davis hit a career-high 33 home runs. That was second among first basemen and three more than Prince Fielder…in 23 fewer games. Worst case scenario, you’ll have a great relief pitcher to add to your bullpen. Mat Gamel, Brewers - If patience was a fantasy baseball stat, Gamel would be an All-Star. Early in his career, he was stonewalled by Fielder. Last season, he finally gets a chance to play and injures his ACL. About a month ago, Gamel’s future was again in question. Would he get reps in the outfield? Would Corey Hart split time with him at 1B? Now with the news that Hart will miss three to four months after knee surgery, Gamel jumps up the rankings. With Mat likely hitting behind Ryan Braun, Aramis Ramirez, and Jonathan Lucroy the deck is stacked in Gamel’s favor to shine. I wouldn’t stretch in the draft for him, but I’d keep Mat in the queue for a bench or utility role. It’s tough to tab first basemen as sleepers. Since there are so many 25-homer bats at the position, you’re looking at 15-18 or them going in the top 150 picks. Still, here are a handful of second-tier and low-end guys that can provide late value on draft day. Ike Davis, Mets – Ike, Ike, baby! Davis started slowly in 2012 due to an illness called Valley Fever, and hit just five homers in the first two months of the season. Then he hit 27 homers from June 12 through the end of the year, while posting an impressive .888 OPS in the second half. The main concern about Davis is his .227 batting average, but that was dragged down by some bad BABIP luck (.246 last season). There’s 40-homer upside here, and even though his BA won’t be great due to a high strikeout rate, it probably won’t hurt you. Davis has been going in Round 10 during early drafts at Mock Draft Central, and I suspect he’ll be on a few of my teams. Kendrys Morales, Mariners – Morales missed most of 2010 and all of 2011 with an ankle injury suffered during a home run celebration. His return in 2012 was OK, as he batted .273 with 22 homers and a .787 OPS. But look a little closer, and you’ll see that Morales hit 14 homers with an .810 OPS in the second half. Great? No, but solid, and with a bit more upside than most when you’re looking for that backup corner infielder. Check Morales’ 2009 stats to see what’s possible. Brandon Belt, Giants – Yeah, I know. It’s hard to pick a first baseman if you can’t expect at least 20 home runs, let alone 15. However, Belt is only 25, and his minor-league track record suggests more power than he’s shown so far in San Francisco. He’s no more than a late-round pick in standard mixed leagues, but he could give you a batting average north of .280 with 20 homers and 10 steals. I’m ready to give him one more chance. Logan Morrison, Marlins – Morrison has been a disappointment as a big leaguer, showing only modest power with a .250 batting average, and his 2012 was cut short due to a knee injury that eventually required surgery. LoMo’s failure to reach his potential has made him a forgotten man in fantasy circles – he’s basically being ignored in early drafts (ADP: 262). You shouldn’t expect a breakout, but he’s still young, will bat third in the Marlins’ pitiful lineup, hit 23 homers in less than 500 at bats a couple of years ago, and also qualifies in the outfield. That versatility could help you in daily lineup leagues, and the bet here is that he’ll be a pleasant surprise.",Raw Data
738,"ATLANTA Youd be hard pressed to find a more composed and confident athlete in his dealings with the media than Tony Gonzalez. Yet there was Gonzalez talking about how he had never cried after a win until Sunday, the first playoff victory in his brilliant career. Not until the Falcons miraculous 30-28 victory over the Seahawks sent them to the NFC Championship Game against San Francisco at the Georgia Dome next week. Gonzalez has consistently said this season that he is 95 percent sure that this, his 16th year in the NFL, will be the final one in what is certain to be a Hall of Fame career. But talking on Sunday, he didnt sound like that 5 percent of doubt loomed. He sounded like someone who knew his brilliant career was coming to an end without a playoff win to adorn it after going 0-for-5 in his previous five trips to the postseason. Gonzalez thought he was going to be 0-for-6. The Falcons led by 20 entering the fourth quarter but he watched them blow it. They trailed 28-27 with 31 seconds left in regulation. At the end of the game, I thought, Here we go again and I guess it wasnt meant for us to get a playoff victory, I guess for me individually, I guess it was never going to happen, Gonzalez said. But the guys stuck in there and we were able to make those plays. I tell you what, I am happy because emotionally it was up and down and what a rollercoaster of emotions. Im spent right now, but Im so happy that we were able to pull it out. Gonzalez was targeted seven times and caught six passes for 51 yards, including a one-yard touchdown. As usual, Gonzalezs yards represented quality over quantity: four receptions went for first downs and a fifth was the touchdown. Between the regular season and playoffs, Gonzalez owns a mind-boggling 1,264 receptions, second all time, and 106 of them have gone for touchdowns. But he said a rather ordinary 19-yard reception over the middle on Sunday was probably the best and most important catch I ever had in my life. Thats because that catch, with 13 seconds left in regulation, set up Matt Bryants 49-yard, game-winning field goal. Shoot, Ill never forget it, Gonzalez said of his catch. It was wonderful. Gonzalez arrived in Atlanta in 2009, improving what was an 11-5 team the year before, but head coach Mike Smith credited Gonzalezs professionalism for getting the team to where it is. Watching him practice rubs off on everyone on our football team, Smith said. Not just the wide receivers, tight ends and offensive players. He affects everybody. Among those with whom Gonzalez is close is four-time Pro-Bowl wide receiver Roddy White. White said seeing Gonzalez so emotional was kind of crazy. But when youve been in the league 16 years and thats the first time you win a playoff game, its going to be like that, White said. Im happy for that guy. He deserves it. On to next week. I was like, Hey, man, stop all the crying, lets go. So Gonzalez will have time to collect his emotions a swing he said he had never experienced. He went from I guess it wasnt meant to be to all remaining possible. One more thing, he said. Just because we got this victory, this isnt it. I told you from the beginning, our goal is to try to get to the Super Bowl win and this is one step closer for us and Im happy for it.",Raw Data

740,"Tim Tebow has been criticized for years about his quarterback skills, his arm and how he throws. He refuses to accept anyone calling him a quitter or phony. The New York Jets backup quarterback insisted Wednesday that he didn't ask out of running the team's wildcat plays last week, but acknowledged what he said in a meeting with coach Rex Ryan might have been misinterpreted as such. ''I never said, `Hey, I don't want to do anything or I won't do anything,''' Tebow said. ''That wasn't the talk at all. He knows that, and everybody on this team knows that. I'd never not do something if I was asked, and I think that's what's disappointing about the whole situation, people saying, `You quit,' or, `You didn't do this.' It was not it at all. ''It was just me asking to get an opportunity to play the position I love, which is quarterback. It wasn't me asking out of anything.'' Last Tuesday, Ryan chose to go with third-stringer Greg McElroy over Tebow in place of the benched Mark Sanchez for Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers. After hearing the news, Tebow went to Ryan to discuss the situation and told him he wanted to be ''a regular quarterback.'' ''I was definitely disappointed and frustrated,'' Tebow said. ESPN New York first reported Sunday that Tebow had then asked out of the wildcat, and a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed that to The Associated Press. But Tebow thinks it was a situation in which he wishes he was ''more clear'' when he initially spoke with Ryan. Tebow realized that Ryan might have misinterpreted what he said when they met when he wasn't in wildcat packages during practice Wednesday and Thursday, and then sat down with the coach last Friday to clear the air. ''I just asked for an opportunity to play quarterback and he definitely understood that,'' Tebow said, ''and then Friday, I went up to him again and reiterated that, `Hey, I'll do anything for this team like I have all year.''' More than anything else, Tebow said, he's most disappointed by the attacks on his character and reputation during the last few days - adding that his Christmas ''wasn't the best'' because of all the talk about how he let his team down. ''When people talk about how you play football and how much, that's one thing,'' Tebow said. ''That really doesn't bother me. I think the only thing that's been disappointing these last few days and frustrating is people saying, `Oh, you quit on your team or you're not a good teammate.' ''For people to not know the situation and then start to bash your character and then say you're a phony or you're a fake or you're a hypocrite, I think that's what's disappointing and that's what's frustrating. Your character is who you are as a man, and that's a lot more important.'' Tebow later added: ''You work your whole life to build a reputation, and then people try to bring you down when they don't understand even what happened. It's disappointing.'' Miami center Mike Pouncey, who played with Tebow at the University of Florida, walked through the Dolphins' locker room Wednesday saying: ''Free Tim Tebow!'' That has been the sentiment among Tebow's many supporters, yet the popular backup has had a minimal role in the Jets' offense. He hasn't played a snap in four of the last five games, partially due to him recovering from two broken ribs, but he hasn't been the dynamic addition the Jets expected him to be. New York will either trade or release Tebow after one season. Looking for more on the Jets? Get the inside slant, stats, scores, schedules and more scoops right here. When asked if he wanted to return to the Jets next season, Tebow said: ''I'm looking forward to this game vs. Buffalo, and we've got to pull together and get a win.'' Not exactly a ringing endorsement, especially from a guy who repeatedly said he was ''excited'' to be a member of the Jets when he was acquired from Denver last March. ''It's hard for Timmy, man,'' Pouncey said last week. ''Timmy is a great player. He's a great friend of mine. I wish him nothing but success, and I know he's going through a hard time right now. I had the opportunity to talk to him after our last game and you could tell that he was upset and sad that he wasn't the starting quarterback up there. But I know that once he gets his opportunity he'll do the best he can. ''If the opportunity is not in New York with the Jets, it will be somewhere else. He's a guy who is never going to give up on anything, and I know he wants to be a starting quarterback in this league. And that day will come again for him.'' Notes: CB Antonio Cromartie and S LaRon Landry were selected to the Pro Bowl as backups on the AFC roster. It's the first time the Jets are sending two defensive backs - and it comes in a year in which star CB Darrelle Revis was lost early in the season with a knee injury. ''When Revis went down, it speaks volumes to what guys took on and made sure everyone was being accountable,'' Cromartie said. ''And our back end doing what they were supposed to do.'' Landry is the first Jets safety to go to the Pro Bowl since Erik McMillan went in 1988-89. LT D'Brickashaw Ferguson is a second alternate, while C Nick Mangold and KR Joe McKnight are third alternates.",Raw Data
741,"Whenever the Knicks lose, Amar’e Stoudemire can be found in some corner of the locker room with his head down, voice low and legs wrapped like a mummy from the costs of another wasted effort. Stoudemire then pledges that the Knicks have yet to accomplish anything of substance and notes the urgency to snap out of whatever malaise that is on the verge of setting in. The More Technicals Jackson Gets, the More Perplexed the Bobcats Become (February 7, 2011) Keep up with the latest news, on the court and off, with The Times's basketball blog. Go to Off the Dribble Stoudemire again backed his sentiments with an on-court statement Sunday by roaming for 41 points in the Knicks’ comfortable 117-103 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks (26-24) avenged a narrow loss to Philadelphia (23-27) two days earlier and regained some cushion between them and the 76ers. They won for the fifth time in their last 15 games behind Stoudemire, who matched his season high, and Landry Fields, who scored a career-high 25 points and had 10 rebounds. “We knew how important this was,” Stoudemire said. He also totaled seven rebounds, four assists and a couple of push-ups when he fell after being whistled for a fourth-quarter foul. “I couldn’t stop Amar’e one-on-one, and as a team, we couldn’t stop him,” said Philadelphia’s Elton Brand, who had a team-high 28 points after scoring 33 in the 76ers’ win on Friday. The Knicks moved the ball better, a point Coach Mike D’Antoni emphasized before the game, and they shot a season-high 59.7 percent and made 11 3-pointers. The Knicks held Philadelphia to 28 rebounds, the lowest by an opponent this season, in part because the Knicks left few to grab. Ultimately, however, there was a bittersweet edge to the afternoon. Stoudemire received his 14th technical in the third quarter from the official Bob Delaney. Stoudemire had poked the ball loose from Spencer Hawes but fouled him. Stoudemire raced up the court in protest, a relatively mild act, but Delaney assessed the technical. The N.B.A. is trying to curtail player complaints. With 32 games left in the regular season, Stoudemire is two technicals away from an automatic one-game suspension. “I hope they look at it and I hope they rescind it,” D’Antoni said. “I don’t know. To me, I don’t know how you play the game without any emotion whatsoever.” The Knicks season’ is chugging along in a rickety pattern of winning streaks and skids. With less than three weeks left until the Feb. 24 trade deadline, the Knicks are in the process of determining whether to try to obtain Carmelo Anthony now, or later through free agency. The latest discussions involve the Minnesota Timberwolves as a facilitator in an Anthony deal, according to two people involved with the talks, who voiced skepticism that it would develop much further. In the proposal, Anthony would go to the Knicks from Denver and the Nuggets would receive Wilson Chandler from the Knicks and Corey Brewer and a first-round draft selection from Minnesota, which would import Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry’s expiring contract. Minnesota’s possible involvement was first reported by ESPN. It is just the latest in season-long speculation involving Anthony. Any discussion involving Anthony can drag on, as the Nets could attest, and nothing will probably happen until near the trade deadline. “I don’t think we have anything going, but at least we’re getting a feeling of possibilities, let’s put it that way,” Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, said. He added that he was not feeling more confident about a deal, but “we have a better feeling for what’s going to happen.” Anthony’s greatest strength is his scoring. On Sunday, the Knicks needed no such help as six players scored in double digits. Their defensive efforts lapsed again, though, and Philadelphia shot 54.2 percent. The Knicks led throughout the second half, but the 76ers sliced the deficit to 6 points entering the fourth quarter. Chandler and Toney Douglas stretched it back out with 3-pointers. Stoudemire shot 5 for 5 in the fourth quarter, part of his 9-of-10 second-half performance. Fields made three 3-pointers in the fourth quarter. “He either stopped the bleeding or put us ahead,” D’Antoni said. “He’s been playing good all year.” With the Knicks struggling of late, D’Antoni started center Timofey Mozgov for the first time since Nov. 16, when the Knicks had plummeted to 3-7. D’Antoni acknowledged that he had rushed Mozgov into a starter’s role and reduced him to a sometime part-time and often no-time player. Mozgov had 8 rebounds and 3 points in 30 minutes Sunday. “We would like to get to the point where we have a big lineup out there with Mozgov,” D’Antoni said.

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. Anthony Pettis described the shoulder surgery as ""minor"" before he entered the operating room. It wasn't and neither has been the wait for the lightweight to get his chance at a UFC title, a shot that Pettis could inch closer toward with a victory over Donald Cerrone at UFC on FOX 6 on Saturday. Take a look at the most brutal shots from UFC on FX 7. ""It turned out I had two tears in my labrum,"" Pettis told FOXSports.com. ""I thought I'd only be off a couple months. Then they found (further damage) and I wasn't even able to train until the end of the year. I couldn't do anything but wait for my shoulder to get better."" The last time Pettis, 25, fought — a knockout victory of Joe Lauzon — was the same night Benson Henderson seized the lightweight crown with a decision over Frankie Edgar last February. Henderson has defended the title twice since (victories over Edgar in a rematch and Nate Diaz) as Pettis was sidelined with shoulder issues and a staph infection. Cerrone went as far as to claim Pettis was ducking him. ""I'm not a guy that runs. Ever,"" Pettis said on a recent conference call with reporters. ""I mean, I'm not afraid of anybody in the division. I'm going to fight everybody in the division. So for him to be calling me out while I'm injured, it sucks."" A victory over Cerrone doesn't necessarily mean a shot at Henderson, whose last loss came against Pettis. Pettis beat Henderson to claim the final WEC lightweight title in December 2010 before the promotion was absorbed by the UFC. Pettis and Cerrone are among the list of contenders in a weight division that is one of the strongest in the UFC. Others include Daiz, Gilbert Melendez, Gray Maynard and Michael Chandler. Maybe that's why this fight could be the most pivotal in Pettis' career — even if he's playing it off as a run-of-the-mill bout. ""I think he's just another guy at the top of the division,"" Pettis said. ""Everyone is tough up here. I'm confident coming back and I have no doubt in my game."" This bout may not be atop of the UFC on FOX card — that honor goes to the flyweight title fight between champ Demetrious Johnson vs. contender John Dodson — but many around the sport have already labeled the fight as a potential Fight of the Year candidate. ""I think the fight's going to be exactly what all the fans and the media think it's going to be,"" Cerrone said. ""We're going go and throw the (expletive) down. I mean Anthony is where he is because of where his talent is."" It's easy to see why this fight is so anticipated, trash talk aside. Both are athletic and have shown they can win in just about any situation. Pettis could be the more balanced fighter with a solid stand up game as well as being an excellent grappler. ""I wouldn't say (Cerrone is as well-rounded),"" Pettis said. ""He's got a good stand up game and he's a decent wrestler. I still know what's coming."" Pettis is best known for one the most acrobatic moves in MMA history, the so-called ""Showtime Kick"" he unleashed against Henderson when he ran up off the fence and delivered a debilitating kick to Henderson's head. Cerrone said in the weeks before the fight such stunts won't work against him. ""Everybody knows what my style is and what I'm going to do,"" Pettis said. ""Try to stop it. I mean, they know I'm a flashy fighter. They know I got crazy kicks. I'm good everywhere and they just got to stop it. So he can say anything he wants to say but, you know, on (Saturday) we're going to see what happens."" However it happens, a victory gets Pettis at least back in the title conversation, something he's been left out of for nearly a year. ""I was definitely on the outside looking in,"" Pettis said. ""I do feel like I'm one of the best in the lightweight division. I'm going to go out there and prove that. Against a guy like Cerrone, it's the best guy to prove (that) against. Come (Saturday), I guess that question will be answered if I'm at the top of the division.""",Raw Data

Visit Jay's exclusive page for hot scoops and watch MMAthetics and The After Party. After another disappointing season in Dallas, the Cowboys fired defensive coordinator Rob Ryan on Tuesday. Shortly after sources confirmed the firing to FOXSports.com, Ryan began telling friends in the league that he has been let go. Who's fired and hired? Check in here for all the NFL head-coaching moves. He then confirmed the news himself, though apparently is not too concerned about being unemployed. ESPN's Tim MacMahon tweeted that Ryan told him, ""I'll be out of work for like five minutes."" ''At this time, the decision has been made to move forward in a different direction philosophically on defense,'' Cowboys coach Jason Garrett later said in a statement. ''I have an immense amount of respect for Rob as a person and as a football coach.'' Some players also reacted to the firing, taking to Twitter to praise Ryan. ''It was a privilege to play under Coach Rob Ryan! One of the greatest,'' defensive end Jason Hatcher wrote. ''Sad day. I'm hurting right now.'' The Cowboys ranked 19th in the NFL in total defense in 2012 and gave up the ninth-most points in the league, 25 per game. It was his second season with the team. In 2011, the Cowboys were 14th in total defense and gave up 53 fewer points. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. Dallas' defense sputtered down the stretch this season, surrendering at least 28 points in four of the final six games of 2012, going 3-3 in the process. Some of that, however, could be attributed to the loss of key cogs on defense, including inside linebackers Sean Lee and Bruce Carter, who were both lost for the season before December. Dallas was Ryan's fourth stop in his NFL coaching career, as he served as defensive coordinator in Cleveland (2009-10) and Oakland (2004-08) after coaching linebackers in New England from 2000-03. The firing came a day after Dallas cut loose running backs coach Skip Peete. The Cowboys finished the season 8-8, losing to Washington in Week 17 in a game where the victor would win the NFC East and the loser would go home. — The Associated Press contributed to this report",Raw Data
744,"When you watch Lawrence Frank day in and day out, as I’ve had the pleasure of doing for the past three months, it’s clear he has a plan. He’s so fundamentally sound and so into the game and such a student of basketball. He has goals for individuals and goals for the team and this group continues to get closer and closer to achieving those goals. Kevin O’Neill, former Pistons assistant coach under Rick Carlisle, is a very good friend of mine who was Lawrence’s head coach at both Marquette and Tennessee. He always told me great things about Lawrence – a tireless worker and a really solid guy who got along with everybody and that’s exactly what I’ve seen from Lawrence Frank this year. To me, he has a great understanding of how to achieve the delicate balance between pushing players and being very exacting as a coach and also getting along with his players. We all know there are coaches – and a lot of them – who could do one or the other, but it’s very, very difficult to do both. If you do that, you have a chance for great success. I see that success on the horizon, but I have to add that I don’t think it’s that far away. You can’t spend a few hours around Lawrence Frank and not realize that he understands this game. He has wisdom far beyond his years. He made a decision a long time ago that he wanted to be a basketball coach and he works so hard at it. His preparation is beyond the beyond, but he doesn’t consider it work. I believe it’s a labor of love for him. He truly enjoys it. If you’re around Lawrence, you find you can’t ask him a question that he doesn’t have an answer for and a lot of statistical evidence to back it up. Players don’t get this far without being intelligent on top of being talented. If they’re around a coach who really has some answers when they need answers, they’re going to open their ears and their eyes and really listen and watch. I think that’s what happens with the top-shelf coaches. I’ve seen tremendous improvement from his team all year long. The 4-20 start was difficult. I always figure it shouldn’t matter to me, doing my job, how the team is playing. But sometimes it can be hard to watch. All of that has changed. I love how they’re playing right now and they’re only going to get better. As Joe Dumars said last week, Lawrence has the same approach in good times and in bad. He doesn’t overreact to anything. He responds but he doesn’t overreact and there’s a dramatic difference. Nothing happens that he doesn’t know about on the basketball court. He’s going to try to make a correction or maybe even run more plays similar to the ones that are working out the right way, but he will never not respond to a situation – positive or negative – on the court. But, again, he won’t overreact. The guys who can do their business that way, especially on this level, I believe will be able to stay with a team long enough and keep their attention long enough to have the kind of success that every franchise wants for their team. As I said at a gathering we had for Fox Sports Detroit with the Adcraft Club of Detroit at Comerica Park a few weeks ago, when you have a coach who is a gym rat and you know that, maybe some people have their mind made up about him before they meet him and think this guy is going to be difficult and have a one-track mind. But he’s not difficult. He’s not just a good guy, he’s a great guy. The media respect and like him and I really, truly believe his players believe that, too. Is basketball his top priority? Absolutely? Is coaching basketball what he wants to do? Absolutely. I don’t think he wants to be a general manager. If you’d ask him if he’d rather be a coach or an owner, I think he’d rather coach. Certainly basketball is at the top of his list, but he’s awake so many hours he finds time to stay in touch with everything else in the world, too. And I think that helps him as a coach. It’s going to be a tough, uphill climb given the schedule the Pistons have had recently and still have staring them in the face, for them to make the postseason. I’m not saying they won’t, but I will say this: If you see how they’re playing now, coming so close to being able to play a full 48 and finish games and get wins, they’re getting there. If the Pistons do not make the postseason, they’ll finish the season playing as well or almost as well as any other team that doesn’t make it. All that means is success is just around the corner. It makes the potential for next year very exciting.",Raw Data

746,"Four players embroiled for nearly 10 months in the NFL's bounty investigation of the New Orleans Saints no longer have to worry about suspensions or fines, and can try to move on with their careers on the field. Off the field, the fallout from the dispute could endure for some time, particularly in federal court. In a surprising rejection of his successor's overreaching punishments, former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue threw out ''all discipline'' current Commissioner Roger Goodell had imposed on two current Saints, linebacker Jonathan Vilma and defensive end Will Smith, and two players no longer with the club, Browns linebacker Scott Fujita and free-agent defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove. Tagliabue, appointed by Goodell to handle player appeals in the matter, essentially absolved Fujita, but agreed with Goodell's finding that the other three players ''engaged in conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football.'' The 22-page ruling Tuesday allowed both sides to claim victory more than nine months after the league first revealed the Saints' bounty scandal to shocked fans, describing a performance pool operated by former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams that, among other things, rewarded hits that injured opponents. The four players punished by Goodell have maintained they were innocent of taking part in bounty program from the beginning, saying they never intended to injure anyone on the field. Vilma even has filed a defamation lawsuit against Goodell in U.S. District Court in Louisiana, and his lawyers, Peter Ginsberg and Duke Williams, said they intend to continue to pursue those claims ''vigorously.'' Feed your NFL addiction! Come feast on all the news in our updating blog. ''Commissioner Tagliabue's rationalization of Commissioner Goodell's actions does nothing to rectify the harm done by the baseless allegations lodged against Jonathan,'' Vilma's lawyers said a statement. ''Jonathan has a right and every intention to pursue proving what really occurred and we look forward to returning to a public forum where the true facts can see the light of day.'' While no other players have yet filed similar lawsuits, Hargrove's agent, Phil Williams, said this week that ''the NFL dragged (Hargrove's) name through the mud and lied about him,'' costing him an entire season of his career. Hargrove was cut by Green Bay shortly before the regular season. His agent said a number of other teams inquired about signing him, but only after they were confident that bounty matter had been resolved. That has finally happened, as far as the NFL is concerned, but there are only three weeks left in the regular season. Vilma, suspended by Goodell for the entire current season, and Smith, suspended four games, have been playing for the Saints while their appeals were pending. Fujita who was facing a one-game suspension, is on injured reserve. Hargrove's suspension initially stood at eight games but was reduced to seven with credit for his first five games missed as a free agent, essentially reducing the ban he'd been facing to two games. Tagliabue's ruling did nothing to vindicate Saints coaches or the organization. Rather, the former commissioner criticized the Saints as an organization that fostered bad behavior and tried to impede the investigation into what the NFL said was a performance pool designed to knock targeted opponents out of games from 2009 to 2011, with thousands of dollars in payouts. A ''culture'' that promoted tough talk and cash incentives for hits to injure opponents - one key example was Vilma's offer of $10,000 to any teammate who knocked Brett Favre out of the NFC championship game at the end of the 2009 season - existed in New Orleans, according to Tagliabue, who also wrote that ''Saints' coaches and managers led a deliberate, unprecedented and effective effort to obstruct the NFL's investigation.'' He said Vilma and Smith participated in a performance pool that rewarded key plays - including hard tackles - while Hargrove, following coaches' orders, helped to cover up the program when interviewed by NFL investigators in 2010. ''My affirmation of Commissioner Goodell's findings could certainly justify the issuance of fines,'' Tagliabue said in his ruling. ''However, this entire case has been contaminated by the coaches and others in the Saints' organization.'' Tagliabue said he decided, in this particular case, that it was in the best interest of all parties involved to eliminate player punishment because of the enduring acrimony it has caused between the league and the NFL Players Association. He added that he hoped doing so would allow the NFL and union to move forward collaboratively to the more important matters of enhancing player safety. ''To be clear: this case should not be considered a precedent for whether similar behavior in the future merits player suspensions or fines,'' his ruling said. Tagliabue oversaw the second round of appeals by players, who initially opposed his appointment. The former commissioner found Goodell's actions historically disproportionate to past punishment of players for similar behavior, which had generally been reserved to fines, not suspensions. He also stated that it was very difficult to determine whether the pledges players made were genuine, or simply motivational ploys, particularly because Saints defenders never demonstrated a pattern of dirty play on the field. ''The relationship of the discipline for the off-field `talk' and actual on-field conduct must be carefully calibrated and reasonably apportioned. This is a standard grounded in common sense and fairness,'' Tagliabue wrote in his 22-page opinion. ''If one were to punish certain off-field talk in locker rooms, meeting rooms, hotel rooms or elsewhere without applying a rigorous standard that separated real threats or `bounties' from rhetoric and exaggeration, it would open a field of inquiry that would lead nowhere.'' Saints quarterback Drew Brees commented on Twitter: ''Congratulations to our players for having the suspensions vacated. Unfortunately, there are some things that can never be taken back.'' The Saints opened the season 0-4 and are now 5-8 and virtually out of the playoffs after appearing in the playoffs the three previous seasons, including the franchise's only Super Bowl title to conclude the 2009 season. Shortly before the regular season, the initial suspensions were thrown out by an appeals panel created by the NFL's collective bargaining agreement. Goodell then reissued them, with some changes, only to have them overturned. ''We respect Mr. Tagliabue's decision, which underscores the due process afforded players in NFL disciplinary matters,'' the league said in a statement. ''The decisions have made clear that the Saints operated a bounty program in violation of league rules for three years, that the program endangered player safety, and that the commissioner has the authority under the (NFL's collective bargaining agreement) to impose discipline for those actions as conduct detrimental to the league. Strong action was taken in this matter to protect player safety and ensure that bounties would be eliminated from football.'' The players have challenged the NFL's handling of the entire process in federal court, but U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan had been waiting for the latest appeal to play out before deciding whether to get involved. The judge issued an order Tuesday giving the NFLPA and Vilma until Wednesday to notify the court if they found Tagliabue's ruling acceptable. The NFLPA indicated that it was largely satisfied by how the process worked out, so some federal court claims against the NFL could be dropped on Wednesday, even as Vilma's defamation claims remain. ''We are pleased that Paul Tagliabue, as the appointed hearings officer, agreed with the NFL Players Association that previously issued discipline was inappropriate in the matter of the alleged New Orleans Saints bounty program,'' the NFLPA said in a statement. ''Vacating all discipline affirms the players' unwavering position that all allegations the League made about their alleged `intent-to-injure' were utterly and completely false.'' NFL investigators had concluded that Vilma and Smith were ringleaders of a cash-for-hits program that rewarded injurious tackles labeled as ''cart-offs'' and ''knockouts.'' Witnesses including Gregg Williams said Vilma made a $10,000 pledge for anyone who knocked Favre out of the NFC title game in January 2010. However, Tagliabue found it was not clear if the pledge was genuine or simply a motivational tactic. ''There is more than enough evidence to support Commissioner Goodell's findings that Mr. Vilma offered such a bounty'' on Favre, Tagliabue wrote. ''I cannot, however, uphold a multigame suspension where there is no evidence that a player's speech prior to a game was actually a factor causing misconduct on the playing field and that such misconduct was severe enough in itself to warrant a player suspension or a very substantial fine.'' The NFL also concluded that Hargrove lied to NFL investigators to help cover up the program. The players have from the beginning denied they ever took the field intending to injure opponents, while Hargrove has said he never lied about a bounty program, because there wasn't one. Goodell suspended Gregg Williams indefinitely, while banning Saints head coach Sean Payton for a full season. Tagliabue's ruling comes after a new round of hearings that for the first time allowed Vilma's attorneys and the NFLPA, which represents the other three players, to cross-examine key NFL witnesses. Those witnesses included Williams and former Saints assistant Mike Cerullo, who was fired after the 2009 season and whose email to the league, accusing the Saints of being ''a dirty organization,'' jump-started the probe. Smith said he was pleased that Tagliabue vacated his suspension. ''I continue to maintain that I did not participate in a pay-to-injure program or facilitate any such program,'' he added. ''I appreciate that Mr. Tagliabue did not rush to judgment, taking into consideration all facts presented to him, before ruling — something that was clearly not done by Commissioner Goodell in previous hearings.''",Raw Data
747,"Ken Rosenthal has been the senior baseball writer for FOXSports.com since August 2005. He appears weekly on MLB on FOX. Follow him on Twitter. First off, I’ll believe the Mets are signing Michael Bourn when I see them introduce him at a news conference and present him with a ceremonial cap and jersey. So, the debate over the type of draft pick they should forfeit for him probably is a pointless exercise. Oh, the Mets’ interest in Bourn is serious, according to major league sources. Heaven knows they need outfielders. They have only $33.55 million in commitments for 2014, according to Cot’s Baseball Contracts, giving them the flexibility to sign Bourn — or any free agent, for that matter — to a back-loaded deal. But forgive me for being skeptical. Yes, the Mets locked up third baseman David Wright with an eight-year, $138 million extension in November. But over the past three offseasons, they’ve signed only one free agent for more than $3.5 million — reliever Frank Francisco, who received $12 million. Tip money for Albert Pujols. Now the Mets are going to spend on Bourn, a 30-year-old center fielder whose value will plummet the moment he loses his speed? Now they’re going to turn bold when they stand little chance in the near future against the Uptons in Atlanta, the Mike Rizzo Machine in Washington and Cole Hamels, Cliff Lee and Co. in Philadelphia? Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? Stranger things have happened, particularly when a team awakens from a slumber one day and asks: “How the heck are we going to sell tickets?” But then there is the matter of the first-round pick that the Mets would lose if they signed Bourn. For a rebuilding club, that should be a deal-breaker. Except if the pick is a second-rounder instead. The Mets, as first reported by the New York Daily News, want baseball to cut them such a break. They have a legitimate beef, actually. If they get to the point where they are ready to sign Bourn — capital I, capital F — that beef could lead to a battle between the players union and Major League Baseball. One that the union, and by extension the Mets, probably would have a hard time winning. Here’s the deal: The Mets hold the 11th pick in the draft. But under the new collective-bargaining agreement, only the top-10 picks are “protected.” Teams holding those picks can sign a free agent who received a qualifying offer without losing their first-round choice as compensation. Those teams would lose their second-rounder instead. Sounds clear-cut, except for one thing: The Mets had the 10th-worst record in the majors last season. They fell to the 11th spot only because the Pittsburgh Pirates did not sign their No. 1 pick, the eighth overall selection, Stanford right-hander Mark Appel. As compensation, the Pirates will pick ninth this year. Confused by MLB's transaction rules? You're not alone. We explain it all. The draft goes in the reverse order of the previous year’s standings. The idea is to reward the worst teams with the best amateur players. But under the current system, the Pirates could have won the World Series last season — in theory, people, in theory — and still picked ninth. That’s not how the draft is supposed to work. The sympathy for the Mets, though, can go only so far. The clubs agreed to the new CBA. Negotiators for baseball told them that only the first 10 picks would be protected — as opposed to the previous CBA, in which the first 15 picks were protected, along with any compensation picks. Oh, and lest anyone forget, there is a Scott Boras factor in all this. There always seems to be a Boras factor if there is an opening to be exploited, a loophole to be had. Boras represents Bourn. He also represents Appel. Baseball is not inclined to do Boras any favors — and allowing the Mets to lose a second-rounder instead of a first for Bourn would be doing Boras a big favor, increasing his client’s value. The union, sources say, would side with the Mets, citing bargaining history, the spirit of the provision and sheer common sense. But baseball, according to other sources, likely would fight a grievance by the union. Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates. Baseball would not want to establish a precedent for teams that get stuck just outside the top 10. And other clubs — specifically, the Mets’ rivals in the NL East — would justifiably howl over a sudden change in the rules for the benefit of one club. A deal is a deal, right? The arguments on both sides are worthy, but let’s see the Mets force the issue on Bourn before delving any deeper into the legalities. Let’s see them spend big on a free agent for the first time since signing Jason Bay three years ago. I’m not holding my breath waiting for the Michael Bourn news conference.",Raw Data

749,"What I saw from the Pistons in their great win over Toronto heading into the holidays was what I envisioned when the season began – a team that was in a fight, at the very least, for a playoff spot and probably a legitimate playoff team. I know there have been performances on what’s been kind of a shakedown cruise that haven’t been pretty, but if you look at the recent body of work – three wins in the last four games, and everybody has a clunker, like the Pistons did against the Clippers – you can see that this team still has talent, toughness and character. And I especially attribute that to all three of the world champions – Tayshaun Prince, Rip Hamilton and Ben Wallace. They’re all champions, all great at what they do, and you can put them in any order you want. Tayshaun over the years has done whatever it takes to win, so his numbers – even though he can fill up a stat sheet with the best – don’t always blow you away. But people don’t like to play against him. He’s an excellent defender and a great chase-you-down shot-blocker as we all know. The near triple-double he had in the overtime win against the Hornets shows you what he’s capable of doing at the top of his game, when he’s called upon to score and do his part when it comes to carrying a team. He’s so good at fitting in. I don’t think he has a basketball ego that’s easily bruised. He’s a whatever-it-takes kindof guy, but that 28-point, 12-rebound, eight-assist performance – and throw in three blocks – was the Tayshaun Prince that Pistons fans know and love. When it comes to Rip Hamilton, I believe this: reports of his demise are premature, by at least a few years. This guy has been a certified scorer forever. He’s not even close to being finished. It might be that clearing the air, speaking his peace and dealing with rumors and innuendo and then coming off the bench with a fellow super scorer in Tracy McGrady was the best thing that could have happened. You don’t expect 35 every night, but I expect Rip to be Rip every night from here on out. The basketball IQ of Tracy McGrady, by the way, when it comes to setting up teammates, is off the charts. And I think Rip really and truly appreciates that. And certainly Will Bynum is an excellent setup man, as well. When both of those guys are out there with Rip, it’s a dream come true as a scorer. Don’t ever forget what Rip can do. I was happy for him and I think there’s a lot more to come. Finally, what can you say about Ben Wallace that hasn’t already been said. I talked about Big Ben a few weeks ago when he grabbed his 10,000th career rebound, but I love talking about Ben. He’s his own man. He’s done it his way. His name will be up there with the greatest Pistons of all time. No one is every going to forget Ben Wallace. When you can play game No. 1,000, as Ben did against the Raptors, and not just be a factor but a force, that’s something. He’s so disruptive defensively. Toronto just could not get comfortable.. In game No. 1,000, Ben was still Ben – six rebounds, four on the offensive glass, two steals and three blocks and who knows how many deflections. And he still found time for three assists. His basketball IQ is just one of the many reasons Ben Wallace is a certified Pistons legend. I told him after the game that game 1,000 wasn’t just getting to 1,000 – he was still Ben Wallace and I expect more Ben Wallace in the future. It’s still a thrill for me to watch these three great players – pro’s pros – do their thing for the Pistons, and as long as they’re doing them like we’ve seen them do it in the past week or so as their play improved, I think you’re going to see this Pistons team make a real run at a playoff spot before it’s all said and done.",Raw Data
750,"Villa's Set-Piece Woes Continue Whilst you may consider losing to a Championship side an improvement over defeat to League Two opposition, it would be straw-clutching of an impressively high order. Paul Lambert is a manager on the edge as his Aston Villa side succumbed to another humbling defeat. As one wag mentioned on Twitter, it was fitting that the scorers of Millwall's two goals on Friday were named Shittu and Marquis, because they hint at one of Villa's most evident problems. Last season, the club conceded 25 goals from set-pieces, a statistic that indirectly led to Alex McLeish losing his job. After inadequate set-piece marking cost Villa against West Brom last weekend, Lambert addressed the issue: ""It's not rocket science. You go man-for-man. You just make sure you put your head on it. I'm not sure why it keeps happening."" And again after Friday's defeat: ""The first goal was a set-piece and the second was just a crossed ball. The first was just a bog-standard corner."" When players show an inability to follow basic orders, the buck usually stops with one man. Is Rafa Benitez Running Out Of Ideas? Perhaps the biggest frustration of Rafa Benitez's reign for Chelsea fans is the manager's delayed reaction when the Blues are struggling. For the fourth game in a row Chelsea faded in the second half and required Benitez to find a solution, but the interim boss's first idea was to replace Branislav Ivanovic with Cesar Azpilicueta in a like-for-like change. Eventually Demba Ba arrived to assist Fernando Torres' equalising goal, but if the striker had been introduced earlier the Blues may have avoided a fatiguing FA Cup replay in an already-packed schedule. ""Why did you leave it so late to send Ba on?"" reporters asked following Sunday's 2-2 draw with Brentford. ""Because the team was doing well,"" replied Benitez. But a draw against League One opposition and three wins in the last eight matches isn't good enough for a team of Chelsea's quality and the manager will need to oversee a rapid improvement if the Blues are to avoid another cup exit in the Europa League. Glenn Whelan Latest To Demonstrate Reckless Cowardice The use of two-footed challenges is a cause clbre within today's game and Glenn Whelan is the latest player to go under the spotlight. His 'tackle' on Javi Garcia was wild, and certainly showed 'complete disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, his opponent' - the definition used to decide whether a red card is appropriate. Both feet were in the air and stamped down on the calf of Garcia. The only saving grace is that the Spanish midfielder was not seriously hurt. Tony Pulis is a staunch defender of his players, but he must be left fuming by Whelan's wilful negligence. There is no defence for such cowardice in the tackle, and the Stoke manager would do well to discipline Whelan for his actions. Such incidents merely establish reputations further. Thankfully, given Howard Webb's failure to even caution Whelan for the challenge, the Stoke man should expect a letter from the FA and a punishment for his stupidity. In a week where the whole of football has seemingly lost their collective sh*t about Eden Hazard's altercation with the Swansea ball boy, Whelan's challenge was far more serious. Liverpool's Inconsistency Plumbs New Depths Brendan Rodgers has made several calls for Liverpool to show more consistency over the past month and the manager will be bitterly disappointed with his team's performance in their embarrassing 3-2 defeat to Oldham. The result is even harder to swallow after the Reds' fantastic display against Norwich in their previous fixture, in which Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge demonstrated an exciting understanding. But both strikers were surprisingly subdued on Sunday and it wasn't until Steven Gerrard arrived to take the captain's armband from Suarez that Liverpool really sparked into life. As we move closer to the final third of the season, the Reds can no longer afford any slip-ups if they are to remain in the hunt for fourth in the Premier League and Rodgers must ensure that the FA Cup exit doesn't leave a harmful hangover. Wednesday's clash with Arsenal at the Emirates will go a long way in deciding Liverpool's ambitions for the rest of the campaign and the manager may be left to reflect on two wasted opportunities before a tough test against Man City on Sunday. Giroud Brings Cheer To Arsenal Olivier Giroud has suffered somewhat for a problem he can do nothing about: he simply isn't Robin van Persie. This season was always going to be after the Lord Mayor's show for Arsenal fans, and Giroud's struggles in front of goal have been well-documented. Well, prick back your ears and listen to this: Van Persie scored ten goals in his first 50 league appearances for Arsenal. So far this season, Giroud has 13 goals in 33 games, a more than satisfactory return. Whilst the Frenchman's two finishes against Brighton were registered with suitable aplomb, most pleasing for Arsenal's travelling fans will have been the link-up between Abou Diaby and Giroud for the striker's second goal. It was reminiscent, dare I say it, of Van Persie and Alex Song on occasion last season. Giroud may not be the second coming of Jesus, Elvis Presley reborn or the new Van Persie, but he's still a damn good striker at times. An Ode To Pablo Zabaleta Is there a better role model in the Premier League than Pablo Zabaleta? The Argentine epitomises all that we should cherish in a footballer. He is paid well for what he does, but in an age of complacency it is immediately evident that he cares as much as supporters would like, and is highly regarded amongst the backroom staff at Eastlands thanks to his continued commitment to community visits. His stamina and fitness are beyond question, but it is his attacking influence that has become particularly noteworthy. He has four goals in his last 20 domestic appearances (a better record than James Milner and David Silva, amongst others), and his assured calm has seen Micah Richards become a forgotten man at City. City have spent 492million on 36 players since Zabaleta arrived in August 2008. Not many of them have been as important or as loved. Making Changes A Dangerous Game Both Harry Redknapp and Chris Hughton made significant changes for games against lower-league opposition, and both paid a heavy price. In truth, neither side should have struggled at home, especially given the experience on show (QPR's side contained seven internationals), but the FA Cup is not a tournament that can be taken lightly. The position of Swansea as odds-on favourites to win one of the three domestic trophies should have sent a message through the Premier League that there is no Top Four monopoly on the country's silverware. But it appears that certain players failed to get the memo. Both QPR and Norwich started slowly on Saturday and only stepped up the urgency when their ships had already sailed. Just how much damage can a shellacking at home do? Instant evidence can be sourced from the vociferous boos at Roads Carrow and Loftus, and supporters will feel that they have been significantly short-changed by their club. The true impact of such humiliation will be seen in the forthcoming weeks, but both clubs at least owe their fans heartfelt apologies for such inept displays. Andre Villas-Boas Failed To Judge The Occasion Andre Villas-Boas is normally known for his obsessive attention to detail, but the manager's team selection left much to be desired in Spurs' 2-1 defeat to Leeds. You may be astonished to learn that Villas-Boas has not picked the same centre-back pairing in consecutive matches since October, and his decision to partner Steven Caulker and Jan Vertonghen on Sunday proved costly in Spurs' sorry exit. Firstly, both Caulker and Vertonghen usually play on the left and so the young England international was forced to start on his weaker side where he struggled against the lively runs of Ross McCormack and Luke Varney. It was a situation that could easily have been avoided had Michael Dawson not been left on the bench. Furthermore, Dawson would have been a better candidate to deal with Leeds' aerial onslaught. Villas-Boas may have concerns over the England international's suitability for his favoured high line, but on Sunday the manager should have told his team to sit deep to negate their opponent's leading threat of straight long balls into the box. Instead Spurs looked woefully disorganised in defence, with Caulker and Vertonghen repeatedly forced to turn and chase Leeds' punts back towards their own goal line. Villas-Boas had the opportunity to change the team's shape at half time, and he was culpable for a disappointing cup exit through his inaction. Nani Missed A Chance To Shine There was little for Manchester United to gain from their cup game against Fulham. From the moment Aaron Hughes took leave of his senses to hand the home side the lead there was only going to be one winner, and United were never forced out of a comfortably low gear. Such occasions do allow attacking options the chance to impress, but Nani missed his opportunity. His decision-making in the final third still leaves much to be desired, and the quality of his final ball consistently drew groans from an expectant Old Trafford crowd. The Portuguese winger may not get many more chances. Nani is no longer a potential prospect for the future (he is 27 this year), and his manager has an embarrassment of riches at his disposal on the right wing. Fergie's purchase of Wilfried Zaha will surely force one of United's wide options out of the club. At the moment, Nani seems the ideal candidate for departure. ITV And ESPN Ignore Cup 'Magic' Saturday's live games were both pedestrian, verging on dull. But was this any surprise? Both were all-Premier League affairs that in a league sense would not be viewed as stellar fixtures. There is a great deal of guff written about the 'magic of the cup', but surely the TV schedulers should be playing on that very abstract concept in a bid to attract viewers to their live games. Where was the possibility of the glorious upset with Macclesfield v Wigan or Norwich v Luton? Where was the potential for an open, flowing game with Brighton v Arsenal? And where was the banana skin of Bolton v Everton or QPR v MK Dons. All five ties would have provided added interest to the neutral, and yet both broadcasters opted to stick rather than twist. Viewers were punished with low-key affairs, whilst the decision makers paid a heavy price with high-profile upsets elsewhere.",Raw Data
751,"The suspensions of those players, plus unsigned free agent Anthony Hargrove, for their roles in New Orleans' pay-for-pain bounty scandal were lifted Friday by a three-member appeals panel. The Saints' Smith and Fujita, now with the Cleveland Browns, probably will play in Sunday's season openers. Vilma can at least rejoin teammates and coaches in New Orleans - and get paid - even if the linebacker is not yet ready to play because of knee problems. And Hargrove can start talking to NFL teams about giving him another shot, after he was cut by the Green Bay Packers. Still, there's no telling how long the reprieve will last. Coming just two days before the first full slate of NFL games this season, the ruling is a setback for Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league. But while the decision allows the players to rejoin their teams, it does not permanently void their suspensions. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Goodell would ''make an expedited determination of the discipline imposed'' for violating the league's bounty rule. ''Until that determination is made, the four players are reinstated and eligible to play starting this weekend,'' Aiello said. Vilma, who had been suspended the whole season, tweeted: ''Victory is mine!!!! -stewie griffin'' Added Fujita: ''I'm overwhelmed with all the support. Thank you so much everyone. Can't tell you how much it means to me.'' The ruling does not affect New Orleans coach Sean Payton, suspended for the season, interim coach Joe Vitt (six games) or general manager Mickey Loomis (eight games). While the panel did not address the merits of the NFL's bounty investigation, it found that Goodell overstepped his authority in hearing the players' appeals of their punishments for participating in the Saints bounty program, which paid cash bonuses for hits that injured opponents. The panel's decision states that Special Master Stephen Burbank, not Goodell, should discipline players for receiving money from a pool that paid for big plays. Goodell's role, the panel said, should be limited to whether he can prove the players intended to injure opponents, which would fall in the category of conduct detrimental to the game. Players and coaches implicated in the bounty pool have testified under oath in a related federal court case they never intended to injure opposing players. ''Whether the commissioner tries to readdress the situation or not is his call,'' said Peter Ginsberg, Vilma's attorney. ''We are certainly hoping the appeals board has made it clear the commissioner tried to grab jurisdiction and impose penalties over an area he does not have oversight. ... The factual record in the court makes it clear he has acted in a biased and inappropriate manner.'' In a memo sent to all 32 NFL teams after the ruling and obtained by AP, NFL legal counsel Jeff Pash emphasized that ''nothing in today's decision contradicts any of the facts found in the investigation into this matter, or absolves any player of responsibility for conduct detrimental. Nor does the decision in any way suggest what discipline would be appropriate for conduct that lies within the authority of the Commissioner.'' The league's investigation found that Saints coaches and players, led by former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, ran a program from 2009-11 that offered cash payouts for hits that injured opponents. It said specific bounties were placed on quarterbacks Kurt Warner and Brett Favre in the 2009-10 playoffs. The Saints open their season at home against Washington on Sunday, while the Browns host Philadelphia. The NFL granted roster exemptions to the Saints for both of their suspended players and to the Browns for Fujita, meaning New Orleans could carry up to 55 players and Cleveland 54. Earlier this week, Saints interim head coach Aaron Kromer said Smith, who participated in training camp and the preseason before he began serving his four-game suspension on Monday, would be ready to play against Washington if available. Vilma's status was not as clear. His season-long suspension began before training camp and he has been trying to work his way back from offseason surgery on his left knee. Saints players had just finished practice when they received word of the panel's ruling. ''It's huge,'' said Saints safety Malcolm Jenkins, a defensive captain. ''Those are two huge leaders we've got. They're great players. We've got a talented team, but you add Will Smith and Jonathan Vilma, our talent level goes up that much. For our team, it's a break.'' Even if Vilma could not play right away, Jenkins said his presence in the locker room and meetings would be valuable. At Browns headquarters, linebacker D'Qwell Jackson was sure the 33-year-old Fujita would be able to come back and have an immediate impact. ''I'm confident Scott has been keeping his conditioning up and he knows the system,'' Jackson said. ''He's got what 12 years in? He'll be fine. If he's able to come back there will be a lot of excitement in this locker room.'' Fujita was barred from Cleveland's training facility this week, but he stayed in town and worked out on his own at nearby Baldwin Wallace University in the event the suspension was lifted. Fujita, who serves on the NFLPA's executive committee, had expressed confidence he would be on the field in Week 1. Hargrove, docked eight games, was released last month by Green Bay and is not currently with a team. The appeals panel consisted of retired federal Judge Fern Smith of San Francisco, retired federal Judge Richard Howell of New York, and Georgetown professor James Oldham. It met in New York last week to hear arguments from the NFL Players Association, which appealed Burbank's ruling that Goodell had the authority to hear and rule on the players' appeals of their suspensions. NFL attorneys had asked the panel to affirm Burbank's ruling, but the panel sided in large part with the union. The decision likely means that consolidated federal lawsuits brought against the NFL by Vilma and the NFLPA on behalf of the other three players are likely on hold until Goodell reissues punishment. It also spared U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan from having to decide before Sunday on a temporary restraining order requested by the players.",Raw Data
752,"Alex Marvez is a Senior NFL Writer for FOXSports.com. He has covered the NFL for the past 18 seasons as a beat writer and is the former president of the Pro Football Writers of America. He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. Sean Payton wants Saints fans and the city of New Orleans to provide a “gracious” environment when NFL commissioner Roger Goodell comes to visit next week. Just like chugging water and taking aspirin before bed after a bender, the NFL has tried to minimize the headache it knows is coming. This — and not good behavior on anyone's part — is why I believe Goodell lifted Payton’s year-long suspension on Tuesday several weeks earlier than expected. Goodell is shrewd enough to know that any further controversy regarding the bounty scandal that rocked the Saints last year will draw attention away from where he wants the media focus. That’s squarely on Super Bowl XLVII. Payton is doing his part to reduce the local venom awaiting his former judge, juror and jailer. Payton was initially defiant to Goodell when the league announced last March that it had found the Saints guilty of offering financial rewards for knocking opposing players out of games with injuries. He is now sounding a conciliatory tone while toeing Goodell’s company line of a greater commitment to player safety. I wouldn’t say Payton and Goodell are ready to take a walking tour together through the Garden District. But at least in front of the cameras, the relationship definitely doesn’t have the same Pete Rozelle-Al Davis chill as before. When I asked Payton for a description of his relationship with Goodell during a 45-minute news conference Wednesday at the Senior Bowl, he responded with the terms “very good” and “positive.” “It’s changed in that we’ve had a chance to visit a lot,” Payton said in his first comments since being cleared to return. “This was the third full meeting. For me to have an opportunity to sit down 4½ hours on Monday and talk about a number of things openly and candidly with him and vice-versa, it was important. He saw from me the things I was able to reflect upon and make him comfortable with reinstatement.” Goodell realizes he is entering an uncomfortable environment while preparing to lord over Super Bowl festivities. Saints fans are salivating to get their pound of flesh by heckling Goodell — or potentially worse — when he does appear in public settings. Many would rather blindly blame Goodell than admit it was the club’s own fault for not eradicating the bounty program allegedly run by ex-defensive coordinator Gregg Williams after repeated warnings from the league. Payton, general manager Mickey Loomis (eight games) and interim head coach Joe VItt (six games) were all suspended for not curtailing what the NFL described as an irresponsible and dangerous “culture.” This has made Goodell more despised than the most corrupt politicians in Louisiana history (just think about the ground that covers). Restaurants throughout the area have photos of Goodell in their windows with the sign, “Do not feed this man.” T-shirts with the slogan “Free Sean Payton” were hot sellers last summer. Check out the FOXiest fans from stadiums across the country and tweet us your photo. During a trip to the French Quarter last September, I ran into a street performer covered in spray paint. “Gold Man” said tips were never better than when he posed for photos alongside a sign reading “To NFL Roger Goodell” and flashed his middle finger. Saints players fueled additional vitriol with shots at Goodell as their Super Bowl dreams crumbled in Payton’s absence. To an extent, such anger was justified. The league’s case against the Saints was hardly air-tight. Proof came during the appeals process when ex-NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue overturned the suspensions of four players, including two currents Saints (linebacker Jon Vilma and defensive end Will Smith), that Goodell alleged were involved in the bounty program. Tagliabue’s ruling and a 7-9 finish by the Saints was the equivalent of adding more Tabasco to a bowl of gumbo that was already hot enough. Payton would watch video of Saints’ games every week knowing he was powerless to fix a team that wasn’t running the football well or playing any semblance of defense. These failings had a trickle-down effect on the performance of Payton’s prized pupil — quarterback Drew Brees. “Watching from afar there are certain things you would see,” Payton said. “Naturally, it becomes at times frustrating.” Feed your NFL addiction! Come feast on all the news in our updating blog. After a while, though, Payton admits he simply had to accept there was nothing he could do but fill up yellow notebooks with observations and patiently wait to implement them. Now that he’s back, Payton is wasting no time in working to make the Saints a Super Bowl winner once again even though he won’t get the chance to accomplish that inside the Louisiana Superdome where Baltimore and San Francisco will meet. Payton began scouting college talent first-hand at the Senior Bowl on Wednesday morning and had what he expected would be a “painful” afternoon staff meeting planned where the defense would be analyzed. “That’s what 7-9 is,” he lamented. But when he’s done looking back, Payton has to keep moving forward. There are coaching, free-agent and other personnel decisions that must get made. Wasting time thinking about what could have been in 2012 will do him and the Saints no good at this point. “The most important element here is closure and us moving forward,” Payton said. “This next step is important. We’ve got so many other challenges . . . Move onto the next challenge.” I get the strong feeling Saints fans aren’t quite ready to do the same until Super Bowl XLVII has come and gone.",Raw Data

He earned 23 Cup wins as a crew chief, including two victories in the prestigious Daytona 500, as well as a pair of non-points victories in the annual all-star race. The 2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup models have all been unveiled and are headed for more tests soon. Any time NASCAR makes a major change, we question it. The best example I can give you is electronic fuel injection. I was very concerned with electronic fuel injection, and we went through some growing pains with it in the early going. Just ask Brad Keselowski. He had several issues that were not fuel injection but were parts and pieces related to fuel injection. But you know what, in the second part of the year, he never even brought it up. Which was a good thing. That means it was a non-story. I’m sure we’ll go through some growing pains. There are going to be some teams that are going back to the drawing board with a blank sheet of paper. But the brilliant move that NASCAR has made is opening up the testing for teams next year. It scheduled the two additional tests at Charlotte here in mid-December and then is letting the teams go back there in mid-January. The more track time, the more data acquisition they get, the more time they have to work with it. By the time the season gets started, they're going to be pretty close. But there’s no question, it's not much different than when the then-named Car of Tomorrow came out in 2007, which that was a totally new package. That was not only a new body, that was a new chassis and a new everything. That was absolutely going back to the drawing board and back to the very beginning. Even though there are a lot of other rules changes going on with the new body, trying to get mechanical grip back in the cars and trying to get them where they’re not so aero-dependent, I think you’ll see teams make big leaps and bounds. We may even see one or two organizations, just like Hendrick Motorsports in 2007, that really rise to the top quickly with the new body. But the big thing is these cars look cool, they look like race cars. That is something that the fans are excited about and that they are going to truly embrace.",Raw Data
754,"Before the former Chicago Bears star fired a bullet into his chest last year, he left word with his family to have his brain examined for damage he believed was caused by repeated blows to the head from his hell-bent style on the football field. Junior Seau was an even bigger star in the NFL, and yet he ended his life Wednesday in much the same way as Duerson and former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling: self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Now friends wonder if the San Diego icon hoped his death might leave a greater legacy than any of his amazing feats on the gridiron. Former player Kyle Turley, who is dealing with his own mental issues and has already agreed to donate his brain for research after his death, has no doubt that Seau wanted to make sure his brain could be studied for the telltale signs of football-related trauma. That's why, Turley believes, his friend shot himself in the chest instead of the head. ''Knowing Junior as I did, he was a very strong kid,'' Turley told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ''Somewhere, the wires got crossed and he unfortunately decided to end his life. But in his last moment — and I will without a doubt believe this until the day I die — Junior Seau ended his life in a valiant way.'' Seau's death was ruled a suicide by the San Diego County medical examiner's office after an autopsy Thursday. Officials were awaiting a decision by the family on whether to turn over Seau's brain to unidentified outside researchers for study. A more in-depth investigative report could take up to 90 days. Seau, 43, was one of the NFL's most rugged players, a fierce-hitting linebacker selected for the Pro Bowl a dozen years in a row. He played for three teams over two decades, far longer than the average football career, before finally retiring for good at age 40. Three years later, he decided to end his life. There were signs of trouble away from the field: a divorce, a domestic violence charge involving his girlfriend, though he was never formally charged. Hours before the domestic violence arrest, his car plunged over a 100-foot cliff in what some speculated was an attempt to kill himself. Seau survived with only minor injuries and insisted that he had simply fallen asleep at the wheel. Seau never indicated publicly he was having trouble with life after the NFL because of all those blows to the head, and his family said he seemed happy. That's a far cry from Easterling, who died last month at age 62. He suffered from dementia and led a lawsuit filed by a number of prominent retired players, claiming the league didn't do enough to deal with concussion-related injuries. Notably, Seau didn't join that lawsuit. Also, it's not known if he wanted Boston University, which has been conducting research into football-related head trauma, to study his brain for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease that can be caused by multiple concussions and only detected after death. The school said in a statement it was ''saddened by the tragic death of Junior Seau,'' but declined to discuss his case without family approval. Thomas Demetrio, an attorney for the Duerson family, said it would be ''pure speculation'' to say that Seau had the same motivation for ending his life as the former Bears safety. ''Dave made it easy,'' Demetrio said. ''He left notes. He sent texts to his family letting them know he wanted his brain studied. I don't know that we have a good answer for why Junior did it.'' But if Seau was dealing with CTE or a similar condition, that would make it easier to comprehend what sort of jumbled thoughts the former player might've had running through his mind. Demetrio hopes that Seau's family will allow his brain to be studied by the Boston University team. ''We know that CTE affects your judgment. We know it affects the control of your emotions. We know that it affects your suicidal tendencies,'' the attorney said. Others also were struck by the method of death that Seau chose. ''Junior, as we know, put the gun to his chest,'' said Shawn Mitchell, a longtime San Diego Chargers chaplain and pastor at a church in Oceanside, Calif., the beach community where Seau lived and died. ''He was a very big man. If any man could take a bullet and live through it, it would be Junior Seau. He chose to do it that way.'' Seau surely had troubles in his life. Beyond those that were readily apparent to the public, there were plenty of whispers that he played so long largely because he needed the money, that his divorce took a heavy toll on his finances. Turley isn't buying it. Seau, he said, came from humble beginnings and wasn't driven by money. Even if most of his earnings went to alimony and child support, it shouldn't have been enough to drive him over the edge. ''You can talk about the divorce, say he was failing financially. Whatever,'' Turley said. ''A lot of people are dealing with that and they don't kill themselves. This is a person who had more reason to live than not. It just doesn't make sense.'' He is convinced that another factor was in play, a hidden killer that Seau couldn't make sense of and no one else could see. ''There are myriad factors that create a downward spiral of depression,'' Turley said. ''But every one of these cases is exactly the same as far as the brain is concerned. There's a very visual disruption in the brain areas that control impulses, depression, anxiety and all those other things that contribute to this occurring.'' Demetrio said the more players who allow their brains to be studied, the better. Seau's death might help others in the NFL think of the ramifications of head injuries on the field, he said. ''For the benefit of the players playing the game today, starting in peewee football all the way up, the more evidence that can be compiled,'' Demetrio said, ''the safer the game will be.''",Raw Data
755,"﻿AKRON, Ohio — There are maybe 200 people in the gym at Firestone High School on a snowy Friday night. Even those just there for the cheerleaders or a little friendly conversation recognize the best player on the court. He's the biggest guy on the floor, probably standing 6-foot-4 and weighing 225 pounds, but he jumps into passing lanes like a 5-10 guard. His braided hair flops from side to side as he runs the floor, and on this night the overmatched opponent is especially in trouble when he dips his broad shoulder into the lane. He's part-bull, part-bully out there, a fully-grown man nearing the end of his high school career. He's a little like his dad was, but the player who goes by J.T. Lane insists he's better. Jerome Lane Sr. laughs at that thought. ""J.T. can't jump half as high as I could,"" Lane said. Twenty-five years ago Friday, Jerome Lane made the play of his life, a play so good it's come to be known as The Dunk. Then a junior at Pitt, Lane made the highlight play of his life when he caught a pass from then-Pitt point guard and now-Arizona head coach Sean Miller and went up for what became a tomahawk dunk. The rim came down with Lane. The backboard shattered. Color commentator Bill Raftery made an emphatic and now infamous call of ""Send it in, Jerome!"" A couple hours before taking his usual seat as assistant coach for J.T.'s Firestone team Friday night, Lane shrugged his shoulders while discussing not just of the anniversary, but The Dunk's shelf life. ""It must have been a spectacular dunk if people are still talking about it,"" Lane said. ""I dunked the ball a lot of times, in a lot of different ways, but I don't think there's one better than that one. There was obviously some force behind it, but I think it was the angle, too. ""It was the beginning of the (use of the) collapsible rim. I came down, and the rim came down with me, and I'm just thinking the screws came out. Don't get me wrong, I felt like a muscle man, but at the time it all happened so fast. ""Then I felt some glass in my back. It was in my hair, everywhere. The glass was all over the floor. And the poor guy (from Providence) I dunked on, he was on the floor and had glass all over him. ""They hadn't quite mastered the collapsing backboard. If I helped them figure that out, that's pretty cool."" Jerome Lane Jr. has his own first name, but he's never had trouble mimicking his father's game or following his legacy. A decorated football recruit and starter on the Firestone basketball team since his sophomore season, J.T. Lane plans to sign with the University of Akron's football program next month and then also walk on to the basketball team. ""It's an honor for me to have a dad that played in the NBA and that everybody remembers,"" J.T. said. ""He doesn't talk about his career much. He gets on me, but I know I'm better than he was. I can dunk better. ""I always feel somebody's watching me. I know I have big shoes to fill. I have to come out and bust my butt every time I play."" Asked specifically about The Dunk, J.T. said he's seen it ""hundreds"" of times. With a half-smile, he didn't back down from his claim that he's capable of similar. ""I think he went up with his strong leg, the backboard was weak and the rest is pretty good history,"" J.T. said. ""He got lucky."" During that 1987-88 season Jerome Lane was listed at 6-6, 230 pounds. He's 46 now and not exactly in playing shape, but he still looks strong and fit enough to grab a rebound or two if called upon. He's built solid, and on many nights the two most intimidating guys in the gym when Firestone is playing are both named Lane. When he stands to yell at his son, cheeks red and shirt untucked, it's because he holds J.T. to very high standards. ""There was a time, not too long ago, that I would have said J.T. is just a decent player,"" Jerome said. ""He's really changing his game. He can handle the ball. He's improved his court awareness. I'm proud of how he's worked at it."" The senior Lane said the other Firestone players know him simply as coach Lane, not as someone who made one of the most memorable plays in college basketball history. ""I'm fine with that,"" he said. ""I'm just Jerome. When I was done playing (he played five NBA seasons, then in Europe), I came home to Akron hoping to live a regular life. I can walk the streets in Akron, have fun, talk to people ... I like it that way. I don't like a lot of attention. ""People don't even know that I played in the NBA. They just know about The Dunk, and I'm cool with that. I can think of a whole lot of players who get forgotten. And it's a real shame, but kids right now don't know Larry Nance, and Larry Nance had a way better career than Jerome Lane. I was his teammate 20 years ago, and I was in awe of Larry Nance. ""That's just one example, but one thing I've found is people know about The Dunk. The young kids can see it on YouTube. Older people, they see me and that's the first thing they bring up. I had a guy tell me around Christmas he hasn't forgotten that play for 20-some years, and I guess now it's 25. People keep it alive. It's an honor for me."" A few of the Firestone players saw The Dunk for the first time on Friday's anniversary; Firestone head coach Dave Milo made sure of it. ""I showed some of the kids today in a computer class,"" Milo said. ""They were in amazement, like, 'That's coach 'Rome? He looks a lot like J.T.' And he does. J.T. has some pretty good genes. ""I wish more kids today understood the history of the game. Here in Akron, Jerome is a big part of that. And that dunk, that's college basketball history anywhere. I tell the kids about Jerome, and not just that play. I want them to know. ""The first time I saw the highlight, my jaw dropped. I'd seen Gus Johnson dunk like that. I'd seen Darryl Dawkins do it. But Jerome was so strong. It was amazing."" Jerome helps run the Summit Lake Community Center in Akron. He's been an assistant coach at different Akron City Series high schools since 2001. He's been coaching J.T. in football and basketball ""since Little League"" and has helped coach his AAU teams in recent summers. He has a pretty good scouting report on the guy with whom he shares a name — and he's not afraid to share it. ""He's turning up his game,"" Jerome said. ""But he's not as good as his dad.""",Raw Data
756,"Reeva Steenkamp's coffin was draped in a white cloth and carried by six pallbearers at a private funeral Tuesday, just a few hours before Oscar Pistorius said in a court affidavit that he mistakenly killed his girlfriend by shooting her through a bathroom door. Reeva's uncle, Mike Steenkamp, broke down in tears after the cremation ceremony under gray skies in the family's hometown of Port Elizabeth on South Africa's southern coast, saying between sobs: ''We are here as a family and there's only one thing missing and that's Reeva.'' ''We've got together but we miss one,'' her uncle said as he composed himself. Family and friends gathered inside the white crematorium, which had a ''Strictly Private'' sign outside, to pay tribute to the law graduate, model and budding reality TV star who died at Pistorius' house in the early hours of Valentine's Day last week after being shot three times behind a locked door to the toilet. Pistorius said in an affidavit, which was read out by his senior defense lawyer in court in Pretoria, that he loved her deeply and shot her in a tragic error because he thought she was a dangerous intruder in his house. Prosecutors argue he intended to kill her after a fight and he was charged with premeditated murder. Reeva's parents, Barry and June Steenkamp, hugged mourners after the ceremony, which was closed to the media and the public on the wishes of the family. Singing could be heard from inside the building as reporters waited a short distance away outside the gate of the Victoria Park Crematorium. Earlier, the 29-year-old Steenkamp's wooden coffin, which had shining gold handles, the white cloth and white flowers on top, was taken out of a hearse and carried into the crematorium by funeral home staff wearing pink shirts and black jackets. After the service, Mike and Adam Steenkamp, Reeva's brother, walked away from the small group of mourners - which included South African international rugby player Francois Hougaard - to offer a statement to television cameras near the entrance to the driveway to the crematorium. ''I won't say very much,'' brother Adam, who wore jeans, a white shirt and a black suit jacket, said. ''There's a space missing inside all the people she knew that can't be filled again. We're going to keep all the positive things that we remember and know about my sister. ''And we will try and continue with the things that she tried to make better. We will miss her. And that's it.'' Steenkamp campaigned actively against domestic violence and had written on Twitter that she planned to join a ''Black Friday'' protest by wearing black in honor of a 17-year-old girl who was gang-raped and killed in South Africa two weeks ago. What ''she stood for, and the abuse against women, unfortunately it's gone right around and I think the Lord knows that statement is more powerful now,'' Mike Steenkamp said.",Raw Data
757,"If you didn’t make plans to watch the Pistons-Nets game Wednesday night, you might not have ever tuned in. But if you didn’t, you missed a heck of a game. On paper, it didn’t look very likely we’d get one of those. The Pistons were coming off three tough losses and New Jersey was down to eight healthy players. But you never know in this league when a great game is going to break out just because there are so many talented guys in the NBA and always have been. Go back to the first truly great era in Pistons basketball. In the ’80s, people had to make plays with the ball if they wanted to have any chance to win that game. That’s what we saw in New Jersey. Those Pistons teams were fighting against some of the greatest teams of all time, so you had to be able to make a play with the ball or you weren’t going to win. They were able to do it more consistently, really, because they had such great depth – I can’t think of another NBA team that’s ever been any deeper, really. They had so many guys who could make plays with the ball. It started when Kelly Tripucka was our small forward and the Pistons had a pretty darn good team around him and Isiah Thomas, starting with Bill Laimbeer and Vinnie Johnson but also including Detroit’s own John Long and Terry Tyler. There were so many amazing offensive plays made. If you missed shots or free throws or didn’t execute on offense, you had very little chance to win the game. The Pistons got better defensively later in the decade and then they made plays on both ends, but even early in the ’80s, when Kelly and Isiah were leading a Pistons team that at one point would play the highest-scoring game of all-time – who can forget the 186-184 double-overtime win at Denver? – if you blinked, you missed great plays. You could argue the Pistons would have won back-to-back championships with Kelly Tripucka, Adrian Dantley or Mark Aguirre at small forward, for instance, because they were all so difficult to stop. As the decade wore on and Jack McCloskey added Dennis Rodman, John Salley and James Edwards to that great mix of players, you had a team that could play with anybody and was closing in on a championship. But don’t ever forget that it started with a really terrific offensive group. Last night’s game was a reminder that you still have to execute at both ends to win games. And I really, truly believe our current team is getting closer and closer to a team that will make plays with the ball and force the other team to do the same against them. That’s tough to grasp, maybe, when you’re not winning a lot of games, but let’s not forget some of the challenges this team is facing under Lawrence Frank. Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva and Will Bynum have all been out long enough now that you almost forget the Pistons were playing without them on this very difficult road trip. All three of those players are guys who can make plays on the offensive end and have done it on a regular basis throughout their careers. That’s why depth continues to be important in our league and especially important in this compressed schedule. This trip ended with three games in three nights, as most Pistons fans know, and it was a golden opportunity for Walker D. Russell to get on the court and make plays with the ball. He has now proven to me, beyond any doubt, that he can do that in our league. One man’s injury is another man’s opportunity. We saw that with some of the Nets players and we saw it on the Pistons, as well, with Walker D continuing to shine and help set up his teammates. I don’t know if we’ll ever see another team with the kind of depth the Pistons had back in the Bad Boys era, but the New Jersey game was a good reminder how many talented players there really are in the greatest basketball league in the world. Even though it wound up a loss when the Pistons saw two tough-luck shots bounce off the rim in the final seconds, it was a well-played and exciting game. If you love pro basketball, or basketball at any level, you had to enjoy that game.",Raw Data
758,"Eurosport - Megadeal mit Nike: Rory McIlroy Related Content Eurosport - Tue, Feb 19, 2013 17:42 GMT Related Content Bet on Golf The Northern Irishman has not competed since his premature exit from the European Tour's Abu Dhabi Championship but said he was feeling refreshed after mixing some welcome holiday time with 10 days of practice sessions over the past month. ""I'm actually much happier with how I'm swinging the club,"" world number one McIlroy told reporters at Dove Mountain on Tuesday while preparing for Wednesday's opening round. ""The clubs were performing fine in Abu Dhabi, it was just the fact that I wasn't swinging at my best. I feel like I've turned a corner with my swing. I've got it back on track, and that's ultimately what's going to help me play better."" Widely panned for switching his golf brand last month from Titleist to Nike in a lucrative deal reported to be worth as much as $250 million over 10 years, McIlroy said he now tried to blinker himself from criticism as much as possible. ""At the start (of his career) I guess I paid a lot more attention to it, but now I try to not read anything or not watch anything because you don't want any negative thoughts creeping into your head,"" the 23-year-old added. ""It's part of what we do. We're under the spotlight and we're going to get criticised from time to time, rightfully or wrongfully so. That's just the way it is. I've learnt that, and I'm dealing with it."" McIlroy, who has put a new putter and a slightly heavier driver in his bag, said he had prepared himself for likely criticism when his switch to Nike was announced with much fanfare before last month's Abu Dhabi Championship. ""I knew it would happen if I didn't play well, and I probably put a little bit too much pressure on myself to play well because of that,"" he smiled. ""Abu Dhabi was a busy week. There was a lot going on. ""But I've had a nice few weeks off and I feel like I'm coming into this event prepared, ready and swinging the club well. Hopefully that can translate into playing some good golf and getting quite far into this week."" Six-times major champion Nick Faldo was among those who criticised McIlroy for his switch from Titleist to Nike, telling Reuters it was ""a dangerous move"". McIlroy responded: ""Nick Faldo doesn't know how I feel over the golf shot and I don't know how he felt, but my guess is he was a little more analytically minded than I am. ""I try and keep things as simple as possible. If I see the ball going in the direction that I want in the flight that I want, then I'm happy. It feels good, and hopefully I can show that to everyone this week."" McIlroy, who has been vacationing with his girlfriend, former world women's tennis number one Caroline Wozniacki, in recent weeks, will take on a good friend, Ireland's Shane Lowry, in the opening round at Dove Mountain. ""We played foursomes together for Ireland,"" McIlroy grinned. ""We were part of the same Irish amateur team for a few years. ""If we'd have thought playing in the European team championships at Western Gailes that we'd be playing in the first round of the Match Play here in a few years' time ... it's pretty cool to think where we've come from.""",Raw Data

He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. Free agent closer Rafael Soriano agreed to a two-year, $28 million contract with the Washington Nationals Tuesday, major-league sources confirmed to FOXSports.com. Now Boras can focus his attention on finding jobs for starter Kyle Lohse and outfielder Michael Bourn. Soriano is now the highest-paid reliever in baseball at $14 million per year, according to salary data at Cot’s Baseball Contracts. In fact, this deal represents the second-highest annual salary for a relief pitcher in baseball history, behind Mariano Rivera’s $15 million per year from 2010 through 2012. Soriano will take over as the Nationals’ closer after Drew Storen’s memorable blown save against St. Louis in Game 5 of the National League Division Series. Soriano’s deal includes a $14 million vesting option for 2015, which will trigger if he appears in 120 games over the first two years of the deal. By signing Soriano, the Nationals will surrender what would have been the final first-round pick in the 2013 MLB First-Year Player Draft. The New York Yankees — Soriano’s former team — will obtain a compensatory pick between the first and second rounds; it will be their second such pick, after Nick Swisher left to sign with Cleveland earlier this offseason. The Yankees never engaged Boras in contract talks on Soriano after the pitcher turned down their qualifying offer in early November, according to one source. Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports was first to report the agreement.",Raw Data
760,"Going into UFC on FX 7, Michael Bisping was the next logical candidate to challenge Anderson Silva for the UFC Middleweight title. He had gone 6-2 in his past eight fights, with one of the two losses being debatable against Chael Sonnen at UFC on FOX 2 in Chicago, and was coming off a rousing victory over Brian Stann. He was facing off against one of the true legends of MMA, the last man standing from the early days of the UFC, in the Brazilian’s backyard. Silva was even in attendance, as well, to set up the TUF Season 3 winner’s long overdue title shot. You couldn’t have set this up better for Bisping to earn a big-money title shot and give Silva a new challenger. Jon Jones. Chael Sonnen. What more could you want? New episodes Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on FX. And then Vitor Belfort ruined it all by head-kicking him back to the middle of the pack. With Tim Boetsch being punched out by Costa Philippou and Alan Belcher ground out by Yushin Okami, Silva is now left without the crop of challengers that had seemingly popped up after the Sonnen rematch. After the beatdown he gave to Stephan Bonnar in Brazil late in 2012 he had left it open when he’d defend the title again, as he wanted to take some time away from the sport before filming a (questionable) movie with Steven Seagal. And after the last potential challenger to his title lost, and with Chris Weidman being out with a shoulder injury until the summer, even Silva has no clue who’ll he face next. Take a look at the most brutal shots from UFC on FX 7. ""I don't know. I don't know. I need to talk to Dana & Lorenzo,"" the champion said. One has to believe he’s telling the truth. Vitor has already been knocked out in spectacular fashion by Silva and would need two to three more wins in the division against top-tier guys to get another chance at “The Spider.” Hector Lombard has to prove he’s the killer the UFC signed away from Bellator. Weidman’s going to be on the shelf for a while. Chael Sonnen won’t be getting a third crack at the apple nor will Yushin Okami get his second. Everyone else of note has lost recently, as well. Middleweight is full of challengers but none of them is going to cut it. Couple this with Georges St-Pierre wanting to have a couple of fights under him before the super-fight for the ages and Silva’s probably (if not forcibly) content to wait it out to see if someone else pops up to challenge for his middleweight title. He has earned his right to call that shot, of course, and one challenger remains that could perk his ears. There’s one candidate out there, if only by default, that he could face this spring without too much difficulty. Strikeforce champion Luke Rockhold. Of course, Rockhold still doesn’t have a first fight in the UFC despite having come over in the Strikeforce folding. He wants Philippou on FOX in San Jose alongside his American Kickboxing Academy teammate Daniel Cormier, but one imagines he’d jump at the opportunity to take on Anderson Silva instead. Right now Weidman would be the best candidate, but he’s hurt and coming off a significant shoulder injury. He’s going to need a couple of fights to build up the confidence necessary to fully trust that shoulder and face Silva. Make no mistake, with a shoulder injury like the one he has suffered it’ll be a while before he gets back into his pre-surgery groove. Despite all of this, odds are Weidman won’t get the shot. No one has earned a shot by winning impressively on a Fuel TV. To jump from Fuel to headlining vs. Silva in a title bout would be unprecedented. That’s not to say Rockhold’s position isn’t very strong. He’s holding a Strikeforce title and has a win over Silva’s teammate Jacare Souza. And as for that unbreakable precedent, fellow Strikeforce champion Gilbert Melendez is getting an immediate title shot in the UFC against lightweight king Benson Henderson. If Melendez can get a title shot with no prior fights in the UFC then Rockhold can argue for the same privilege. Champion vs. Champion would mean something for Silva, one imagines, and Rockhold should be given fair consideration. It just makes sense.",Raw Data

He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. The improbable last-second comebacks of Baltimore and Atlanta in second-round playoff games were another reminder that there is never absolute certainty in the NFL. Even so, FOXSports.com is going to try and give you the next closest thing heading into this weekend’s conference championship matchups. We’ve ranked all four remaining teams — New England, Baltimore, Atlanta and San Francisco — in 10 categories and rewarded points ranging from best (four) to worst (one). Based upon this, the final totals should reveal which squads will be playing in Super Bowl XLVII Emphasis on should. So who do we think is headed to New Orleans? Continue reading to find out. New England (4): No quarterback has won more postseason games (17) or posted a higher winning percentage (.739 – minimum 15 starts) than Tom Brady. Already the NFL’s all-time postseason leader in completions, Brady is now 227 yards away from surpassing Brett Favre’s all-time postseason mark of 5,855 passing yards. Baltimore (3): When it comes to deep passing accuracy, there is nobody hotter right now than Baltimore’s Joe Flacco. He is averaging a ridiculous 10.8 yards an attempt in two playoff games. A 38-35 double-overtime win over Denver marked Flacco’s fifth career road playoff victory, which is tied with Eli Manning of the New York Giants for the most in NFL history. Atlanta (2): Matt Ryan took a big step toward securing that vaunted “elite” quarterback status with his first playoff win last Sunday against Seattle. Ryan also continued his penchant for clutch play. He has led 22 fourth-quarter/overtime comeback victories in his first five seasons. San Francisco (1): Yup, Jim Harbaugh made the right decision switching from Alex Smith to Colin Kaepernick at midseason. Kaepernick couldn’t have had a better postseason debut than in last Saturday’s 45-31 win over Green Bay. He set the NFL’s all-time single-game rushing record for a quarterback with 181 yards and two scores. Kaepernick added another two scores and 263 yards passing. San Francisco (4): Kaepernick gives San Francisco a running dimension like no other team remaining in the postseason. For meat-and-potato carries, the 49ers have one of the NFL’s most consistent rushers in Frank Gore. He is coming off a 119-yard, one-touchdown effort on 23 carries against the Packers. LaMichael James and Anthony Dixon play complementary roles. New England (3): After having morphed into a pass-first team – and who could blame them with Brady under center – the Patriots are fielding their best rushing attack since Corey Dillon had a 1,600-yard campaign in 2004. Stevan Ridley, who had 1,263 rushing yards in the regular season, continues to lead the way. He is complemented by Danny Woodhead and Shane Vereen, who scored three touchdowns (one rushing, two receiving) in last Sunday’s 41-28 win over Houston. Baltimore (2): Ray Rice rebounded from a two-fumble performance in Baltimore’s playoff opener against Indianapolis by plowing for 131 yards and one touchdown on 30 attempts against Denver. Getting him on track against New England would bode well. The Ravens have a 6-0 playoff record when fielding a 100-yard rusher. Expect a larger role Sunday for swift rookie Bernard Pierce, who had only five carries against Denver after gaining 103 vs. the Colts. Atlanta (1): The Falcons rediscovered their running game against Seattle with Michael Turner and Jacquizz Rodgers combining for 162 yards on 24 carries. Atlanta’s 167 total rushing yards marked the team’s highest output of the season. Turner provides the power; “Quizz” adds speed and shiftiness. Atlanta (4): It’s a pick-your-poison nightmare when trying to slow Atlanta’s plethora of targets. Roddy White (1,351 yards) and Julio Jones (1,198) combined as the NFL’s most productive receiving tandem on one team during the regular season. Tight end Tony Gonzalez remains a matchup nightmare and Harry Douglas is a productive fourth option. If that isn’t enough, the Falcons have rediscovered the screen pass under new offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter. Baltimore (3): Torrey Smith’s emergence as a lethal deep receiving threat continued against Denver as he embarrassed a future Hall of Fame cornerback in Champ Bailey. Jacoby Jones also has wheels – his 70-yard touchdown catch in the waning seconds sent last Saturday’s game into overtime – and Anquan Boldin may be the NFL’s most physically strong possession receiver. Tight end Dennis Pitta doesn’t post monster numbers but he’s good for two or three catches a game that move the chains. New England (2): The loss of Rob Gronkowski (broken forearm) eliminates the two tight-end coverage nightmare that his pairing with Aaron Hernandez provided. But it’s not like Brady is bereft of weapons. Wes Welker extended his postseason streak of games with at least six receptions to eight with an eight-catch, 131-yard showing against Houston. Welker and fellow wideout Brandon Lloyd both had 100-yard efforts against Baltimore in Week 3 of the regular season. San Francisco (1): Season-ending knee injuries suffered by Mario Manningham and Kyle Williams thinned out San Francisco’s wide receiver unit, but Michael Crabtree has picked up the slack with a breakthrough campaign. Crabtree had nine catches for 119 yards and two touchdowns. Just like last season, the 49ers have re-discovered tight end Vernon Davis during the playoffs. Davis gashed the Packers down the seam for a 44-yard grab that led to a touchdown. Offensive line San Francisco (4): This is the nastiest unit left in the playoffs. All three first-round picks – left tackle Joe Staley, left guard Mike Iupati and right tackle Anthony Davis – are living up to their lofty draft status. Despite playing with an injured right arm, Staley did an outstanding job keeping Packers outside linebacker Clay Matthews in check. At 6-foot-8 and 300 pounds, right guard Alex Boone is a load when he pulls. New England (3): Long-time position coach Dante Scarnecchia has worked his magic once again with this unit. Nate Solder (left) and Sebastian Vollmer (right) have emerged as one of the NFL’s top young tackle combinations. Although hampered by injuries for a good chunk of the regular season, Logan Mankins is still a top-flight left guard. Atlanta (2): Like Scarnecchia, new Falcons offensive line coach Pat Hill deserves praise for Atlanta’s improvement in 2012. Left tackle Sam Baker has made the most strides. Albeit the Seahawks were playing without their best pass-rusher, Chris Clemons (knee), it was still surprising that the Falcons didn’t surrender a sack and rushed so effectively against one of the NFL’s most physical defenses. One player to watch Sunday is Falcons rookie right guard Peter Konz. He held up well against Seattle but could get targeted for one-on-one matchups against 49ers stud defensive lineman Justin Smith. Baltimore (1): A unit that was a liability in mid-December is a strength after several personnel changes. Left tackle Bryant McKinnie, who has squandered Hall of Fame potential by being too undisciplined off the field to control his weight, is again playing at a high level now that he’s back in shape. Jah Reid’s season-ending toe injury led to Baltimore substituting McKinnie and shifting Michael Oher to right tackle where he is better suited. The return of right guard Marshal Yanda (ankle) also provided a huge boost. The Ravens have surrendered only two sacks and rushed for 325 yards in two playoff games. San Francisco (4): Even with a partially torn triceps, Justin Smith still sets the pace for San Francisco’s defense. It wasn’t an accident that outside linebacker Aldon Smith’s sack numbers dropped when Smith was sidelined during the final two regular-season games. The 49ers also have the capability to rush star inside linebackers NaVorro Bowman and Patrick Willis. A-gap blitzes gave the Packers fits. Baltimore (3): Terrell Suggs, who missed the first six games with an Achilles tendon injury, finally started looking like his old self against the Broncos. Suggs was a terror with 10 tackles and two sacks. Fellow outside linebacker Paul Kruger has emerged as a nice pass-rushing complement. Kruger had a team-high nine sacks during the regular season and added another 2.5 against the Colts. New England (2): Pressuring the quarterback remains a collective effort for the Patriots. Linebacker Rob Ninkovich, a one-time journeyman whose penchant for big plays is reminiscent of Tedy Bruschi, led the team with eight sacks. Rookie end Chandler Jones ranks second with six, although his health entering Sunday’s game is in question after he was forced to leave against Houston with an ankle injury. Atlanta (1): How much John Abraham means to Atlanta’s pass rush became evident again vs. Seattle after the NFL’s active sack leader was forced out when he aggravated an ankle injury late in the second quarter. The inability to affect Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson in the second half almost cost the Falcons the victory. Even if not completely healthy, Abraham is expected to play Sunday. No other Atlanta defender had more than four sacks during the regular season. Run defense San Francisco (4): The 49ers had the best regular-season ranking among the remaining playoff teams, having surrendered an average of 94.2 yards a game and a mere seven touchdowns. But San Francisco wasn’t nearly as dominant as last season when only three opponents posted 100-yard rushing games, none more than 124 yards. The 49ers were gashed for 136-plus yards five times in 2012 and had a 1-3-1 record in those contests. New England (3): A strong front seven led by defensive end Vince Wilfork and inside linebacker Jerod Mayo paces the Patriots. Mayo notched a whopping 184 tackles during the regular season. New England also has benefitted from the continuing development of young defensive linemen Kyle Love and Justin Francis. After getting trampled for 180 rushing yards by San Francisco in a Week 15 loss, the Patriots held their next three opponents (Jacksonville, Miami and Houston) to a 77-yard average. Atlanta (2): The Falcons were up for the challenge presented by Seattle’s read-option attack, holding All-Pro running back Marshawn Lynch to 46 yards on 19 carries. Kaepernick, though, presents a much greater threat than Wilson, whose 60 rushing yards last Sunday came on scrambles rather than keepers out of the read-option. Kaepernick will be trying to duplicate the regular-season success of Carolina dual-threat quarterback Cam Newton, who accounted for 703 yards from scrimmage (201 rushing and 502 passing) and six touchdowns in two games against the Falcons. Baltimore (1): A streak of nine consecutive seasons with a top-nine ranking against the run came to a screeching halt in 2012. The Ravens surrendered 1,965 yards, which is the most in the franchise’s 17-year history. But as some key defenders like inside linebacker Ray Lewis and defensive end Haloti Ngata got healthier, the Ravens began showing significant improvement. Dannell Ellerbe emerged in Lewis’ absence. Atlanta (4): The offseason acquisition of cornerback Asante Samuel from Philadelphia for a seventh-round draft pick was a steal in several ways. Not only did he rebound from a disappointing 2011 campaign, Samuel provided an outspoken form of veteran leadership that was lacking until his arrival. Safeties William Moore and Thomas DeCoud fed off that energy and came into their own, combining for 151 tackles and 10 interceptions during the regular season. The unit was able to weather the loss of cornerback Brent Grimes, Atlanta’s 2012 franchise player who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in the season-opener. San Francisco (3): The only postseason safety tandem playing as well as Moore and DeCoud are San Francisco’s Dashon Goldson and Donte Whitner. Goldson’s nose for the football earned him his “Hawk” nickname. Whitner is playing better than he ever did with Buffalo, where he spent five seasons after being the No. 8 overall pick in the 2006 draft. Another player who has improved under 49ers defensive coordinator Vic Fangio is cornerback Tarell Brown, who had a 39-yard interception return against Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers that helped lead to San Francisco’s second touchdown. Baltimore (2): The Ravens survived the loss of top cornerback Lardarius Webb (ACL) thanks to strong seasons by Cary Williams and Corey Graham. Graham’s interception of Denver quarterback Peyton Manning led to Justin Tucker’s game-winning field goal. Free safety Ed Reed hasn’t provided the type of big plays lately that will ultimately land him in the Hall of Fame. Strong safety Bernard Pollard is a hammer but sometimes gets into trouble for being too aggressive. New England (1): The midseason trade with Tampa Bay for cornerback Aqib Talib upgraded the secondary. Devin McCourty also has excelled since shifting from cornerback to free safety. Three of McCourty’s team-high five interceptions during the regular season came in the end zone. This unit remains prone to miscommunication and breakdowns, although far less than earlier in the season. Atlanta (4): There’s another “Matty Ice” on the roster besides Ryan. Matt Bryant connected on the 49-yard field goal that gave Atlanta a 30-28 victory over Seattle. Bryant has proven himself one of the NFL’s most clutch kickers during his 11-year NFL career. Falcons punter Matt Bosher, who also handles kickoffs, must rebound from a poor showing against the Seahawks. Special-teams coordinator Keith Armstrong has drawn consideration for head coaching vacancies. Baltimore (3): If Sunday’s game comes down to the wire again, the Ravens won’t be worrying about another choke from their kicker thanks to Justin Tucker’s emergence. Since supplanting Billy Cundiff – the goat of last season’s AFC title game for shanking a 32-yard field goal – Tucker has connected on 32 of 35 attempts. His 27-yard kick as time expired helped Baltimore defeat New England, 31-30, in September. Baltimore, though, must shore the coverage errors that allowed Denver’s Trindon Holliday to return a kickoff and a punt for touchdowns. Jacoby Jones earned Pro Bowl honors after returning an NFL-high two kickoffs for touchdowns. New England (2): Matthew Slater’s special-teams prowess has earned him two straight Pro Bowl berths. The honor is well earned. New England’s opponents had meager averages in punt (6.7 yards) and kickoff returns (20.5) during the regular season with no touchdowns scored. But like the Ravens, New England must rebound from a shaky showing against Houston. The Patriots yielded a 94-yard kickoff return to open the game and a 32-yard Zoltan Mesko punt gave the Texans good field position just before halftime. Houston converted both possessions into field goals. Mesko did have two punts of 60-plus yards and was consistent throughout the regular season. The Patriots are one of nine teams to have registered a punt and kickoff return for touchdowns in 2012. After missing six of his first 25 field goals, Stephen Gostkowski has now connected on 10 consecutive attempts. San Francisco (1): As if a stout defense wasn’t enough of a hindrance for opponents, the 49ers field the NFC’s top punter in Andy Lee. The situation isn’t as rosy at kicker, where David Akers missed 13 field goals during the regular season. 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh has decided to stick with Akers, whose struggles are believed to stem from complications following offseason surgery for a double hernia. The 49ers signed Cundiff to compete with Akers heading into the postseason. Cundiff remains on the roster, but Akers kicked against Green Bay and converted on his lone field-goal try. Backup cornerback C.J. Spillman recovered a muffed punt return deep inside Green Bay territory and registered a great solo tackle later in the game on another punt. Ted Ginn Jr. is a dangerous returner but hasn’t made as much of an impact as last season. New England (4): If the Patriots run the table and win Super Bowl XLVII, Bill Belichick will tie the late Tom Landry for the most postseason victories (20) in NFL history. Belichick is 18-7 in the postseason with three championship rings, although he has lost in both of New England’s last two Super Bowl appearances. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is making people forget what a failure he was as head coach in Denver with the way his unit has performed. Baltimore (3): John Harbaugh has joined Chuck Knox and Bill Cowher as the only head coaches to have ever reached the playoffs in each of their first five seasons. Baltimore’s 61 victories since Harbaugh was hired rank only behind New England (63) in that span. Harbaugh’s decision to replace offensive coordinator Cam Cameron with Jim Caldwell in mid-December is paying dividends. Dean Pees is the team’s fourth different defensive coordinator since Harbaugh arrived. Two of his predecessors – Rex Ryan (New York Jets) and Chuck Pagano (Indianapolis) – are now NFL head coaches. San Francisco (2): Jim Harbaugh is the eighth head coach in NFL history to reach a conference or league championship in his first two seasons (the late Paul Brown holds the record with Cleveland from 1950 to 1955). Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who emerged as a head coaching candidate himself earlier this month, deserve high marks for Kaepernick’s development and salvaging Smith’s career the previous season before his benching. Atlanta (1): Head coach Mike Smith flies under the radar, but the Falcons have posted a 57-27 overall record since his 2008 hiring. Atlanta’s .679 winning percentage in that span is the second-highest in the NFL behind New England (.729). Smith, though, wasn’t getting the respect he deserves because Atlanta lost its opening playoff game in three prior seasons under his watch. The streak ended against Seattle. The hiring of two new coordinators – Dirk Koetter (offense) and Mike Nolan (defense) – proved huge upgrades in 2012. Baltimore (4): Like the New York Giants and Green Bay the previous two seasons, the Ravens are an example of a team floundering in mid-December before catching fire. Lewis’ return and announcement that this will be his final season provided a huge spark. The Ravens enter Sunday’s game with confidence, having defeated New England in September and pushing the Patriots to the brink of elimination in last season’s AFC title game. New England (3): The Patriots are almost invincible at home during the playoffs. New England has a 7-1 all-time record in AFC title games, including a 4-0 mark under Belichick. Brady improved to 11-2 in home playoff games with last Sunday’s win over Houston. Atlanta (2): The Falcons are set to host an NFC title game for the first time in the franchise’s 47-season history. Ryan has a 34-6 career record inside the Georgia Dome. There is actually less pressure surrounding the Falcons this week than entering the Seahawks game because Atlanta finally got over the hump and won in the playoffs for the first time since 2004. San Francisco (1): The 49ers are a better team than the one that reached last season’s NFC title game. As a second-year quarterback, there were questions whether Kaepernick was ready for the pressure that comes with being in the playoffs. There are no more doubts after his brilliant performance against Green Bay. Playing inside a difficult domed environment will provide another challenge. Kaepernick is 2-2 on the road since becoming San Francisco’s starter.

762,"“Thirty years from now I don’t think it will be in existence,” Pollard told CBS Sports. “I could be wrong. It’s just my opinion, but I think with the direction things are going — where [NFL rules makers] want to lighten up, and they’re throwing flags and everything else — there’s going to come a point where fans are going to get fed up with it.” It’s ironic for Pollard to be making these statements, since he is known for hard hits like the helmet-to-helmet shot he delivered to New England running back Stevan Ridley in the AFC championship game, which knocked him unconscious and forced him to cough up the football. Pollard thinks that the way the game is evolving with players getting bigger and faster, something tragic may occur on the field, rather than something years down the line caused by concussions. “The only thing I’m waiting for — and, Lord, I hope it doesn’t happen — is a guy dying on the field,"" he said. ""We’ve had everything else happen there except for a death.

765,"In their most detailed comments since rumors surfaced the team might be shopping Revis, coach Rex Ryan and new general manager John Idzik said they expect Revis to return from his season-ending knee injury as a Jet. ''With respect to clarity, I don't know that anything has really changed because we really have always wanted Darrelle to be a part of our team,'' Idzik said at the league's annual scouting combine in Indianapolis. ''That has not changed. I think there's been rumors or stories published and it's really hard for me or anybody in our organization to speculate and answer to all the rumors or stories that we hear. With respect to Darrelle, we have always wanted him to be a part of the New York Jets.'' The stories about Revis' potential departure had become so consuming that after Idzik walked to the podium and introduced himself to reporters, he spent the next eight minutes talking almost exclusively about the star cornerback. When Idzik finished, it was Ryan's turn to speak his mind, and, as usual, he didn't mince words. ''When I called Darrelle up I said, `Darrelle, let's face it, the man (Idzik) hasn't been on the job for 24 hours and now you're going to get traded?' I thought that was kind of interesting,'' Ryan said. ''And I said, `You know, it's not accurate. Plain and simple, it's not accurate.' I told him that. If he was to be involved in a trade, I think he and his agents would know about it, as would the general manager and myself, I would think.'' That's not where the Revis story ended Thursday. Less than 24 hours after Revis and Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman traded barbs on Twitter, Jets brass was pulled into that, too. Ryan didn't seem overly concerned, and Ryan may have even fueled the Twitter war by saying, ''I don't know him (Sherman) well enough to compare him to Darrelle Revis, but if you put yourself in that company, that's the company you want to be with. That's the company you want to be with, that's for sure.'' ''We know Richard, and to us, it's not a really big deal. It's what makes him who he is,'' Schneider said. ''It's one of the things that made us fall in love with him, and it gives him the confidence to play the way he plays. He feels that he's the best cornerback in the league, and God bless him.'' The bigger question may be where all this goes now. Revis is one of the highest-paid players on a team that just cut five players to get under the league's mandated salary cap, and his contract is up after next season. He is scheduled to make $6 million in 2013 as he tries to return from the left knee injury. Right now, at least, the Jets are saying those things don't matter. They want just want their top cover cornerback to focus on getting healthy and playing football. ''My focus with Darrelle right now is to aid him in any way we can in his rehab so that he returns to the player that we all know he is,'' Idzik said. ''What's good for Darrelle is good for the New York Jets.''",Raw Data

767,"A week ago, his Atlanta Falcons blew a 20-point lead but won through a miracle comeback in the final minute. Again on Sunday in the NFC Championship Game, the Falcons built a big lead -- 17 points at one point. Smith said his message at that juncture was to ""never let up, never give up."" ""That's how you have got to play this game,"" he said. ""In the National Football League, you have to play for four quarters."" The Falcons learned that lesson painfully on Sunday in a 28-24 loss to San Francisco at the Georgia Dome as second half turnovers, one an example of bad luck the other of dumb luck, proved their undoing. The Falcons, playing in their first conference championship game since 2005 and hoping to go to their first Super Bowl since 1999, still have many bright young stars -- wide receiver Julio Jones with a break-out performance on Sunday and quarterback Matt Ryan among them -- but one has to wonder if their window to win a Super Bowl is getting smaller as another year passes and critical players like Tony Gonzalez and Michael Turner might have played their final games in a Falcons uniform. On consecutive possessions in the third quarter with Atlanta leading by 24-21, the Falcons turned the ball over -- both times on the 49ers' half of the field -- and those plays could have made the difference between winning and losing in such a close game. San Francisco only had one turnover, as the Falcons finished minus-1 in the turnover margin. During the regular season, Atlanta's plus-13 mark tied for the fifth-best in the league. ""When you don't win the turnover ratio in the playoffs,"" Smith said, ""you're not going to win the football game."" The first one came on second down-and-10 from the 49ers' 47. Roddy White went into a break on his route but fell down. Ryan had already released the ball and 49ers nickelback Chris Culliver picked it off with 7:38 left in the third. After the 49ers took over, David Akers hit the left upright on a 38-yard field goal try, the ball bouncing out, but the Falcons felt they lost an opportunity to put some points on the board. ""That one's all on me,"" White said. ""It was a crucial point in the game because we were kind of driving, probably going to score some points. That was a tough turnover."" The second one proved even more costly, as the Falcons already sat in field goal range. The miscue was even more uncharacteristic. On the ninth play of a drive at the 49ers' 28, Ryan set up in the shotgun and fumbled the snap. Aldon Smith recovered with 55 seconds left in the third. If the Falcons held on for a field goal there, they could have kicked a short field goal to take the lead with 1:13 left in regulation on fourth down and 4 from the 49ers' 10 -- a play that failed as NaVorro Bowman defensed a pass to White that ended Atlanta's chances to win. Ryan called the fumble a ""freak play."" ""Took my eyes off the ball for a second and it ended up on the ground,"" he said, ""and against a good football team like that you can't have those kinds of mistakes. You have to capitalize on those opportunities -- two chances in positive territory and didn't come away with points. ""When you do that, you're not going to win."" The Falcons are still in good shape with Smith having guided them to playoff berths in four of his five seasons, but in terms of personnel it might not be the same rosy outlook. Gonzalez -- one of Ryan's favorite targets -- looks as if he played the final game of his brilliant career on Sunday. He even asked the media for more time so he could compose himself before speaking. ""Emotional,"" he said. ""That's probably going to be the last time I wear that uniform or football pads and cleats. I didn't want to take it off, tell you the truth. All good things come to an end and like I said all season long this is probably my last one. But what an unbelievable ride."" In addition, running back Michael Turner, a mainstay for the Falcons since Smith arrived, is not assured of returning, as his production has diminished with increasing age and the physical toll of more than 1,400 carries over the last five seasons. Defensive end John Abraham, perhaps the Falcons' most dynamic and productive defender with 10 sacks and six forced fumbles, will be 35 next season. If nothing else, Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff has shown himself adept at drafting and acquiring talent, a record envied by others in the league. Each of the last two seasons, a member of his staff has departed to become a general manager with another team (Les Snead to the Rams last year and David Caldwell to the Jaguars this season). To pry that window open larger, the Falcons will have to continue to reload. If not, it could be another eight years before they reach their next NFC Championship again.",Raw Data
768,"Lawrence Frank is the first to admit his life won’t win any awards for the breadth of his experiences. Like most pro or big-time college coaches, his attention is devoured by the excesses required of the job. To the extent he’s familiar with mainstream pop movies, it’s because he turns his TV on in the middle of the night to help induce a few hours of fitful sleep before he beats everyone else to work in the predawn hours. But when he spoke of the need to “turn a negative into a positive” with regard to Andre Drummond’s back injury, he wasn’t speaking from deep inside the bunker where most coaches take up residence. He was speaking with genuine intent and authority. There really are things Drummond can do in his down time to make himself a better player upon his return. It’s disappointing, of course, that Drummond must sit out until mid- or late March simply because it was such a joy to track the remarkable arc of his progress. Watching Drummond was like monitoring the early months of a baby’s life, where there is almost nothing subtle about the rapid succession of “firsts” accomplished. But there really is a silver lining to this idleness. No. 1 is the nature of the injury – a stress fracture of the fifth lumbar vertebra. It sounds grim – back injuries are notoriously problematic – but once the bone heals, it’s healed, with no reason to believe there will be any degradation. This isn’t a disc injury. It’s not damaged cartilage that even modern medical technology can’t rehabilitate. Drummond’s time won’t be wasted, either. Arnie Kander and his staff are as wowed by what they see from Drummond in the back room at the team’s practice facility – where Kander’s customized weights and contraptions, designed to replicate movements common to basketball activity, are housed – as everyone else is by what Drummond displays in public in games. They’ll have him doing things in there almost immediately. Small example: Perhaps you’ve noticed that on occasion Drummond has lost control of the basketball as he’s gone up to dunk, sending it flying off in the wrong direction. One of the tasks on the off-season agenda for Drummond, at the direction of Kander’s staff, was to increase the flexibility and strength of his grip. He has enormous hands, a gold mine waiting for development, and great hands are critical to a big man’s ability to score around the rim. Ben Wallace’s ability to be effective there was limited by his hand size. Drummond has no such limitations. You can bet Drummond will spend some of his idle time working on that, among a host of other things. Without needing to grow any bigger, they believe Drummond will play bigger once his posture improves to make full use of his length. As with all young players, a focus of the summer was going to be increased core strength. The back injury will only make that more of a focus and, presumably, an area Drummond – a player they’ve found to be every bit as receptive to coaching in the weight room as the coaching staff has found him to be on the court – will embrace. Frank told me last month that as enthused as he was about Drummond’s potential after getting his first glimpse of him during Orlando’s Summer League last July, he wasn’t quite sure Drummond – who had obvious rough edges then – would be ready to crack the rotation as a rookie. “What no one knew is how great a kid he was,” Frank said. “No one knew that. Nice guy, (but) no one knew how coachable he was. I didn’t know that. After Summer League, his work ethic then compared to what it is now – night and day. He couldn’t even do it. His back would get sore” – simple muscle fatigue, wholly unrelated to the current bone injury – “working with the (medicine) balls with Roy (Rogers, assistant coach). The pace, the intensity, he goes at a whole ’nuther level. Now, he’s got a lot more gears to go, but huge, huge improvement and that comes down to coachability, talent, character – do the math.” The disappointing parts of the next month-plus are the joy Drummond derived and provided by playing basketball for the Pistons dries up. But that’s the extent of it. Whenever he comes back, he’ll be back at 100 percent of the dazzling prospect he was pre-injury. And he’ll be back that much farther ahead of the game in those areas that otherwise were going to have to wait until the off-season for attention. So when you do the math, as Frank suggests, you don’t have to do any voodoo accounting to see how Andre Drummond and the Pistons can turn this particular negative into a resounding positive.

769,"Armstrong subsequently admitted in a television interview last month that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs in each of his Tour wins. The UCI's credibility took a further blow when it disbanded a three-person independent commission set up to investigate whether or not the world governing body had helped Armstrong to conceal his drug-taking without sending it a single document. It said instead it wanted to be part of a truth and reconciliation commission. At a World Anti-Doping Agency media symposium in London on Tuesday, WADA president John Fahey said he had received a letter late on Monday from the UCI again requesting a truth and reconciliation commission. ""Was it asking?,"" he said. ""It was more telling. It nominated four people from the organisation which did not include (UCI president) Pat McQuaid who would be representing UCI in such discussions."" Fahey said WADA had said all along it was more than happy to work out a way to deal ""with this constant crisis which seem to surface in cycling"". He said, though, the process had to be under the management and control of the original independent commission. ""So I put those terms back, that's the starting point, it hasn't changed for several weeks. If they are serious they will talk to us,"" he said. Fahey said the terms truth and reconciliation were ""wonderful fancy words"". ""I think we leave that where we should leave it, where it had some meaning and that is in days gone by in South Africa,"" he said. ""Only cycling can heal the problems cycling has, they're independent, they run their own sport, the same as any other sport in the world. ""If the members are prepared to continue to allow this lurching from one crisis to another then I guess we are going to continue to read about turmoil in that sport for some time yet.

772,"Those 3-pointers put him in the record book. A drive to the basket put the Knicks back in the win column. Anthony tied a franchise record with nine 3-pointers, then converted a go-ahead, three-point play with 12.5 seconds left to cap a 42-point night and lead New York to a 106-104 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday. The Hawks shot a season-high 60 percent from the field but had their three-game winning streak snapped when Josh Smith, burned on Anthony's basket, missed a 3-pointer on Atlanta's final possession. Anthony wasn't aware of the record, but he clearly knew his shot was on. So did the Hawks, and Smith may have been expecting a jumper on the last possession and was caught flat-footed when Anthony went right by him. ''It was just a matter of me just taking them shots and making them,'' Anthony said. ''I know I'm capable of making them, but when I'm making them from the outside, from the perimeter, it opens up the game that much more, for myself, for my teammates, and that's what happened tonight.'' Amare Stoudemire and J.R. Smith each had 18 points for the Knicks, who were 16 of 27 (59 percent) from 3-point range. Raymond Felton had 12 points and 10 assists in his second game back after a 10-game absence with a broken right pinky. Jeff Teague scored 27 points for the Hawks. Smith added 20 and Al Horford had 16. Anthony matched the Knicks' record for 3-pointers held by John Starks, Latrell Sprewell (twice) and Toney Douglas. He also tied Richie Guerin's franchise record with his 29th straight 20-point game. He pulled up for the final one during a streak of three in a row in the first half from the `G' in the wording ''Madison Square Garden'' — a good 4 feet behind the line. ''One of them heat check shots at that time,'' he said, claiming he was unaware where he was standing and using the term for a player launching from extremely deep or extremely quickly to test how hot he really is. Asked if he'd ever made 10 3's in a game, Anthony responded by asking how many he made last summer in the Olympics. Indeed, he was 10 of 12 in a 37-game point game against Nigeria — not exactly a quality team such as the Hawks. His biggest basket came nowhere near the arc. The Knicks came out of a timeout down by one and Anthony found Smith on him after he was played much of the final period by DeShawn Stevenson, a rugged defender who had frustrated him into a potentially costly technical foul. Anthony blew by Smith to the left, getting fouled as he laid the ball in. ''He took what the defense gave him,'' Felton said. ''Josh Smith kind of lifted his leg a little bit and then he attacked the back leg, got to the basket and got the and-one. He's been doing a great job of finishing games for us and closing out and hitting big shots.'' The ensuing free throw made it 106-104 and Anthony nearly came up with a steal on Atlanta's final possession, but the ball deflected out to Smith, who had a good look that was long. ''It was a good look. It just didn't go down,'' Smith said. ''It was really a back-and-forth game. For us to be able to have a chance at making a game-winning shot or a tying field goal towards the end of that game (with) how well they shot the 3, lets us know that we had a pretty good basketball game ourselves. We just fell a little short.'' A night after an ugly 97-80 loss, the Knicks had no problems on offense, though could never get much cushion against the speedy Hawks. Anthony was poked in the eye by Stevenson with 1:51 left, and responded by angrily slamming the ball to the court, leaving the officials with no choice but to call the technical foul. Kyle Korver made the free throw to give Atlanta a 102-101 lead. Anthony then missed a jumper, but Stoudemire was fouled and made two free throws. Horford scored on an alley-oop eight seconds later, setting the stage for Anthony's final basket. The All-Star forward finished 15 of 28 from the field and was 9 of 12 behind the arc in his fourth 40-point game this season. ''It's difficult, because he can make the 3-pointer and he's also fast,'' Horford said. ''He has a first step, like we say in the league, it's a quick first step and explosive. He's a good player.'' Leading 27-25 after one, the Knicks ran off the first nine points of the second quarter, getting a pair of 3-pointers from Pablo Prigioni to open a 36-25 advantage. The Hawks wiped all of that away in about six minutes, but Anthony steadied the Knicks with three 3-pointers in the final 2:50. It was 52-all at halftime. Anthony then hit five 3's in a 17-point third quarter, his final one making it 82-74. The Knicks needed all his offense to build a lead, with the Hawks making 9 of 13 shots (69 percent) in the period. NOTES: Knicks guard Jason Kidd sat out the second half. The Knicks said the 39-year-old was just being rested. ... Because of Rajon Rondo's torn ACL, he will need to be replaced on the Eastern Conference All-Star team, and Hawks coach Larry Drew hopes Commissioner David Stern looks at Smith or Horford. ''No doubt about it. I think both of my guys have been overlooked,'' Drew said. ''It's unfortunate what happened to Rondo, but certainly my guys should be in consideration.

The New York Mets, landing their first major-league free agent this off-season, have reached agreement with right-hander Shaun Marcum, according to a major-league source. Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? It's a one-year deal, and Marcum still must take a physical. Marcum, 31, likely will be the team’s fifth starter, joining left-handers Johan Santana and Jon Niese and righties Dillon Gee and Matt Harvey. When healthy, Marcum is one of the game’s more effective pitchers. He averaged 198 innings in 2010 and ’11, but missed two months last season with right elbow tightness.

774,"Austria's Marcel Hirscher secured the World Cup slalom title on Sunday and maintained his lead in the overall standings in testing conditions at the Kranjska Gora run in Slovenia. The event was claimed by Ivica Kostelic, of Croatia with an aggregate time of one minute, 45.81 seconds but the big winner was Hirscher, who came 0.19 seconds behind the Croatian to finish top of the slalom standings by a distance from Germany's Felix Neureuther. Hirscher's lead at the top of the overall standings is 149 points from Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal and with four events to come at the World Cup finals in Switzerland he is well placed to defend the title he won in 2012. Ther 24-year-old knew the slalom crown was his after his nearest rival in the discipline, Germany's Felix Neureuther clipped a gate in his opening run.

Schladming ski resort gets tech facelift Putting ski tech to the test Lindsey Vonn vows to take on the men ""I always go 100% percent but today there was one difference between my runs -- I made a mistake in the first one and skied as I know in the second one,"" Hirscher told the official FIS website. ""That's the way I want to ski and it's good to be on the podium again. A big step is done and by scoring 160 points I feel the weekend was really good."" Rain lashed down during most of the afternoon but Hirscher was more than happy the race went ahead. ""If the race would have been canceled today that would have been horrible for me,"" he added. ""It was for sure on the edge of fairness but I think it was fair enough and in the end the best skiers in the world are still among the top ten. It's not ideal but we obviously can ski even when it's raining."" There was an extra landmark for Hirscher to celebrate. He became the first man to secure eight consecutive slalom podiums since Italian legend Alberta Tomba in the 1991-92 season. It was an emotional afternoon for Kostelic, who won in Slovenia for the first time in a little over ten years. He was in third going into the second run but received a slice of fortune when Frenchman Alexis Pinturault did not finish his second attempt. Kostelic said: ""It's a wonderful feeling as it's not easy to stay at a high level in any sport nowadays and Slalom is a particularly tough discipline where competition is really dense. ""This victory is a huge relief and it is very important for me. I saw there was a chance I could win here today but I was also aware that Pinturault had to do a big mistake. I was really pushing for a victory today, it was really my main focus."" The women's slalom event in Ofterschwang, Germany was won by Slovenia's Tina Maze, who has already secured the overall World Cup title and remains on course to win five crystal globes in a season. The 29-year-old posted a time of one minute, 52.85 seconds to beat Wendy Holdener of Switzerland by 0.25 seconds. Her victory took her in front in the discipline standings, replacing American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin at the summit. The 17-year-old came third. Maze now leads Shriffin by seven points in the slalom standings with one race left next Saturday. Maze's 22nd World Cup podium pulled her level with Austrian legend Hermann Maier, having already broken her points record in a season. Maze is now on an overall tally of 2,254 after this, her tenth triumph of the season. ""It's so easy to make a mistake in slalom and its so important to stay calm, that's the reason why I don't think too much about these records"", she told FIS Alpine website. ""Slalom is the most difficult of the five disciplines in my opinion and if you race in all of them, you don't get much time to train. I trained hard all this week to make sure I could compete with Mikaela and the other specialists."" Maze has already secured the overall and giant slalom titles and now leads in the slalom and the super-G disciplines. She is also still in with a chance of clinching the downhill title at next week's World Cup finals.",Raw Data

It was there, in his home, that legendary NFL linebacker Junior Seau was found dead. He had shot himself in his chest with a .357-caliber Magnum. He did not leave a note the way so many other NFLers had. Those others had told of shooting themselves in places other than their brains so they could be studied and, maybe, possibly, answer the question that had been gnawing at them about their memory loss, depression, pain and insomnia. Was the game they loved now responsible for the lives they could no longer stand to live? The sheer magnitude of Seau’s name heightened the despair. It also led to much talk about the sustainability of football. I wrote a column back then comparing the game to smoking, how smoking was once cool, and how science saying otherwise was willfully ignored until lawsuits and common sense brought us to this place where smoking is very much viewed as an idiotic endeavor. I mention this not as some “I’m so smart, read my column” self-congratulatory BS but rather to speak to my mindset at the time. What if, in 20 years, guys I had covered in the league and come to know and respect were ending their lives with .357 Magnums all because I could not give up my idea of what football was supposed to look like? What I know for sure now is Mark Twain was right when he talked about the materials used on the road to hell. I was hardly alone in paving. There was much hand-wringing done by Buzz Bissinger, George Will and countless others about how this could not abide. I can honestly say I arrived at this point with good intentions — a desire to see football made safer, to change our societal need for violence, a commitment to better care for those who stepped into the arena. Then there were those who said this ultimately would not matter, a sentiment most famously captured by JR Moehringer’s “Football is dead, long live football” in ESPN the Magazine. This felt very much like the anti-global-warming folks, ignoring the science and obvious crush of evidence to tell us football would survive. It turns out he understood our addiction much better than I. What all of our good intentions came crashing up against was an NFL regular season arguably better than any before. We saw Adrian Peterson coming back from a catastrophic knee injury to surpass 2,000 yards rushing, and Peyton Manning coming back from neck-fusion surgery to turn Denver into a playoff favorite. We witnessed RG3, Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson be so exceptionally good that each has his team in the playoffs and the Rookie of the Year race feels impossible to call. And we were treated to so many big-boy games — 49ers vs. Patriots, Green Bay vs. Minnesota, Seattle vs. Green Bay — that of course we watched. Cowboys-Redskins to end the NFL season was the most watched primetime game ever. Games on The Big Three channels averaged almost 20 million viewers. An NFL game beat out ""Dancing With The Stars"", ""American Idol"" and ""CSI"" as the most-watched TV show in all 17 weeks of the season. During football season, NFL games were 31 of 32 most-watched TV shows. Almost 200 million viewers watched the NFL this season, more than 80 percent of homes in America. The damage no longer matters. The fallout is pushed from our conscience. Much like I am sure a heroin addict dismisses perils in favor of being able to use one last time, the suicides, the lawsuits, the concussions have been quickly forgotten in our need for games. Just as we were getting real about the consequences of our collective addiction, the NFL put its best product on the street this season. We have become even more football-addled, unconcerned with the dangers and instead searching for our next fix. Why, like with New Year’s resolutions, has our stated desire for a safer game so quickly fallen away? Nate Silver’s exceptionally smart “The Signal and the Noise” helps explain this phenomenon. The book, ostensibly, is about why most predictions fail, yet speaks to why our stated values do not align with our habits when it comes to football. It boils down to the fact we all bring our biases to information. So instead of looking at evidence critically we ""construct stories that are neater and tidier than the real world, with protagonists and villains, winners and losers, climaxes and denouements and usually a happy ending for the home team.” There is no need to construct the story in football. It is constructed for us, week by week, game by game, yard by yard, a tale of warriors playing through pain and overcoming adversity. It speaks to everything we love and believe as Americans. So the story becomes football is king, too profitable to go away. So anything that does not support this theory — scientific evidence about the long-term ramifications of repeated brain trauma, the pending lawsuits, Junior Seau — is ignored. Seau was not the first or last player to kill himself in this rash of suicides. Nor was he the most instructive. Dave Duerson implored his widow in his note to donate his brain to science in hopes of figuring out what extent the banging on his brain, done in the pursuit of the W, had led to his health problems. It is not simply about concussions, although this is what everybody loves to fix upon. The talk surrounding Seau afterward was on how few concussions he had, ignoring that it was the smaller, daily head blows that might be more dangerous. They are the ones players play through, often go untreated and most definitely have a cumulative effect. Four months ago, we cared about all of this stuff, or at least talked like we did. It was scary. It said something about the sharp edges of our favorite sport and as a result said something about us. It was an uncomfortable conversation. So it should be no surprise we quickly tired of it. And what better way to get away than another fix? It is how we ended up back on this road. We know where it started, what it is paved with and ultimately where it leads.",Raw Data
776,"The run goes on and on with a kind of irresistible inevitability, cause for celebration but also cause for concern. Barcelona go into Wednesday's match against Milan top of the Spanish league, a 2-1 victory in Granada giving them a 12-point lead on Atltico Madrid, 16 points ahead of Real Madrid. Leo Messi scored both goals, taking his tally to 37 league goals this season as many or more than 17 teams in Spain's top division and making this latest victory the 14th consecutive game in which he had scored. Another frustratingly simple goal made the win in Granada the ninth consecutive game in which they have let in at least one. They have not kept a clean sheet since a 5-0 win against Second Division Crdoba on 10 January and they have kept only five all season in the league. Barcelona have conceded more than Atltico, Madrid and Mlaga. And it is that, as much as Messi's goals, that has occupied attention as they return to the Champions League. Younger generations would disagree but speak to older Barcelona fans, or even players, and they will tell you that pessimism comes with the package. Silver linings so often have a cloud. Charly Rexach, a man who dedicated three decades to the club as player, coach and youth team director, the man who signed Messi on a napkin, expressed it best: at Barcelona there was always something. And yet he says he is not worried about the trip to Milan. It is not about goals against but about final scores. On the face of it, few in Catalonia should be worried. They are favourites. Bojan Krkic, the former Barcelona player now at Milan, was asked what he considered a good result for his side in the first leg at San Siro. He replied: ""Still being alive."" ""Whoever Barcelona play against, they win 95% of their games,"" said the Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri. ""That's what the stats say."" But the stats also say that Barcelona concede goals: an average of 1.07 a game. They say that Barcelona give teams a chance. For all their dominance they are failing to kill games which, however absurd it sounds, may yet prove problematic. Cesc Fbregas and David Villa, who has not travelled, have six goals each; Alexis Snchez, whose crisis of confidence is evident, has just one. And when they fail to kill games there is no escaping the fact that at the other end Barcelona transmit insecurity. There is something vulnerable about them; the door is left open. That may not matter in the league any more but it is tempting to conclude that it could matter in the Champions League, where they have let in five goals in six games. Better teams should, in theory, punish them more; the vulnerability will be more easily exploited. As Arrigo Sacchi put it: ""There's a big difference between Barcelona and Milan but be careful because a team that's not at its best can be knocked out."" That is the bad news. The good is that greater competition and greater importance might bring with it greater focus, better performances. Still the threat lingers. If not Milan, perhaps whoever comes next. With the league title all but won, an important achievement but one that has been assimilated, Europe will define this season. Barcelona's possession-based game is about defending as well as attacking. They have conceded fewer shots in La Liga than any team except Atltico Madrid. And nor are they as vulnerable in the air as the easy assumption suggests. They are a small team but only Real Madrid have allowed fewer opposition headers on goal than Barcelona and Madrid have conceded four league headers, Barcelona not one. The few chances they concede tend to be clearer, though, and the comparative simplicity of the goals conceded will concern. ""They have to make fewer frivolous decisions,"" Rexach said. There is an element of the short blanket syndrome about Barcelona: you can cover your head or your feet but not both at once. This is, in part, a decision and one that, for all the fears about goals conceded, results vindicate. You can let in one if Messi scores two. They have scored 80 league goals: 20 more than Madrid. Barcelona play high up the pitch. That allows greater control and territorial advantage but when the ball is played or sometimes just hoofed it finds space behind them. Besides, the pressure appears a little less intense than previously. Barcelona are more exposed; the arrival of Jordi Alba on the other side to Dani Alves, gives them two full-backs who like to attack, not just one. Meanwhile, Gerard Piqu, vital to the functioning of the defence, has played more than last year and more than either Carles Puyol or Javier Mascherano but even that is less than 60% of the total minutes played. Barcelona have the talent and temperament to at least partially resolve their problems, if they can be called problems. What they do not have at the moment is the man that can most help them to do so: the coach Tito Vilanova is in New York, undergoing treatment for cancer. He watches every match and training session and is in contact with Jordi Roura, his No2, but he has not been in Catalonia and he will not be in Milan. Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Pedro, on the other hand, will be. And so will Leo Messi.",Raw Data
777,"Rooney Moan ITV summed up last night just why I feel so compelled to point out how average Rooney is. Incase you didn't see it, the adverts before the United game were ""Fulham travel to Old Trafford....and Wayne awaited them"". They showed some clips of the game and then after said something like ""And Rooney was back on form"" then proceeded to show his goal and nothing else. Strachan spouted a load of tosh like him being a top top player who makes others play blah blah. No mention of Giggs. No mention of how actually dire Rooney was. He played terrible overall but had one good moment and then gets all the praise. Unbelievable! Silvio Dante (again) Explaining Sagna's Poor Form Regarding Kiraldo's email about Sagna, i think a lot can be put down to the leg break. Sometimes players come back well from injuries, i.e. Wilshere, but a lot don't like Djibril Cisse, Ramsey and Cech, who has never been that good again. Maybe you can put it down to seeing your leg at an angle or something. It can effect a player in a lot of ways; you miss a year or more of playing and fall behind in skill and pace etc, and also maybe fear of something horrendous happening again it detracts from their effort either consciously or sub consciously. In years gone by I would have baulked at seeing him go, but after warming to Jenkinson maybe it's time Sagna went back home to the easier French league or something. Steve (in Arsene we trust!) Australia Don't Judge Wilf By His Stats One thing that really annoys me, and has steadily increased over the last few years, is the judging of a player based on his stats. The all mighty statistic has over taken actually watching a player and forming an opinion based on what you see. I will admit I like to annoy Liverpool fans with the fact Stewart Downing went so long without an assist but it was actually watching him be atrocious in games that made me feel comfortable slating him. The thing which has me writing in now is obviously Zaha's transfer to United and the inevitable stat check by everyone and their dog, 5 goals and 5 assists for a winger in 32 games is proof 15 million is way over priced apparently. This ignores the fact he has played over a hundred games at a championship club and he's only 20. It's accepted that if you buy a young English player you pay an inflated price without bringing up obvious examples.The thing that really annoys me is where's the stats for wingers who beat a player or two and lay the ball off to a player who then passes the ball to the forward who scores? Where's the stats for corners, free kicks or throw ins won which led to goals? The stats for intelligent movement to pull defenders out of position? Players who win penalties are awarded assists but someone who beats 9 men and squares the ball to a forward who misses an open goal doesn't get anything.Would anyone say Raheem Sterling (2 goals 2 assists) hasn't been good enough this season? What I'm not trying to say is Zaha will definitely be a success, I haven't seen nearly enough of him to judge, but what I have seen is undoubted potential and will reserve judgement until i see more of him myself .There is a reason clubs have people watched in person before signing them. I know it might seem odd to people who spend their Friday setting up their fantasy team, but there's more aspects to winning games than goals and assists that are just as important. Sorry for the rant but what I really wanted to say was put some trousers on, put down the laptop and actually watch some football and judge players properly. GD, Dublin On Schmeichel, Keller And De Gea In response to Ben Baggie, Schmeichel wasn't a world class goalkeeper? I really shouldn't bite at such drivel, but alas I am. You have your opinion about what makes a good goalkeeper, an opinion you seem to think is the only one that matters. My opinion, and I think it's a view shared by many, is that a good goalkeeper is one who keeps the ball out of the goal, hence the name 'goalkeeper'. Schmeichel has the highest ratio of clean sheets:games ratio of any goalkeeper in the premier league era (except John O'Shea of course) playing behind a defence that was generally not as good as the one Seaman played behind. So what if he was unorthodox? Michael Johnson's running technique was constantly criticised throughout his career, yet he set world record after world record. I would argue that it takes a lot more than good technique to make a goalkeeper, Schmeichel's ability to organise his defence was second to none, his presence was second to none, his reflexes were second to none, I could go on but I won't because it's absurd to suggest that Schmeichel wasn't a world class goalkeeper, are you saying he wouldn't have made the West Brom team? Fred, Belfast ...Ben (I could have included Alan Miller and Stuart Naylor in my good keeper list) Baggie. Still laughing at the Villa. You had me. You really did. I read your whole piece with an open mind thinking ""MY GOD MAYBE THE KID HAS SOMETHING!"" in a 20's Chicago style voice. And maybe what you said was bait. SCHMEICHEL!!!!! SCHMEICHEL!!!! The behemoth of goalkeeping. The god of thunder. I used to be a staunch ABU but even as a kid I had to admit that Utd fans had every right to be arrogant over their keeper. Overrated? Maybe, I don't really care about that never ending argument, we can't ever prove an answer. I remember Schmeichel pulling unreal saves, making himself REALLY BIG and in my opinion him being a total dick to Gary Neville made him a better defender than he ever had to be. It wasn't cause Neville was saving his bacon, Schmeichel demanded big d*ckish standards but hes got the medels to show for it. The epitome of a goalkeeper that defenders feel confident in front of. Goalkeeping is much more than technique pal, its about leadership too. And leadership by technique. The worst thing I can remember about Peter was that he had a tendancy to be lobbed a few times. Aside from that I can't think of a fault. Kasey Keller may have probably been better for United but Peter also did pretty well in 92 for Denmark, a team that were definitely not considered among the greats (you might want to look that one up). I thought your argument was really thinking outside the box and something to rejoice, but I just couldn't get past this obvious ""controversial"" pick. Past his peak Schmeichel also played for struggling Aston Villa and Man City teams that were flirting in the relegation game. And they stayed up, in an era were Leicester and Southampton were about the same standard, or a little worse or a little better. You are a brilliant troll. I am still writing trying to remember the awesomeness of Russell Hoult. He was never top calibre. Good obviously, but never overly wanted. I imagine there'll be a few of these. Dave (I can't believe you forgot about Bobby Mimms), Ireland ...Sorry, sorry... Hold on.. Ben, Baggie, did you just say that Kasey Keller was a better keeper than Peter Schmeichal? You may very well be still laughing a Villa my friend but I for one am still laughing at you! Leon, Basel. ...Your argument is so played out it all it highlights is your over-riding desire to be a contrarian and your general lack of respect for the readership of this website. David de Gea is 22 years old. Not only is he 22 years old and playing in the Premier League but he's 22 years old and first choice keeper at Manchester United. Who are top of the league. And before you say it; they have a back four comprised of perma-crocked young pretenders; a central partnership whose salad days are far behind them; and no one in midfield tasked with the specific job of screening said back for. Add to that a new country, new team mates, a new language, new league and the tiny matter of the pressure cooker that is Old Trafford and what do you get? A shaky handed, bumbling, clanger-prone experiment bleeding goals on the reg? No you don't. What you actually get is a surprisingly calm and focused young player who on his is capable of keeping out match-winners on his own. And he's only 22. I mean come on man - no technique? You think that's all reflexes do you? No hand-to-eye involved, no positional awareness to those 'tremendous saves'? Mate have you seen his footwork? Don't use a term like 'technique' when you clearly think all that means is 'one's ability to catch' (ps ,Nigel Martyn was not afraid a parry for the cameras). It's true he's not great at crosses or necessarily communicating with his defenders but - and I know I'm going on here - he's twenty sodding two. He's better than last year, he'll be better next year. Right now, as David James did most of his career, he's winning Utd far more games than he's costing them so let's not write of a 22yr old for not being Buffon quite yet eh mate? To be honest I could go on but my girlfriend's taking me out for a Thai (swag) and I think I've made my point. Someone else can address can address the 'Schmeichel was over-rated' angle for me. Simon (hang on, do you even print mails on the weekend?) CFC ...Kasey Keller was a far better keeper than Peter Schmeichel? Not even just better, but far better? Ben, that is hilarious. I know that one youtube clip isn't a fair representation of an entire career, but about 1.50 into this Keller does something Schmeichel would never have done (and if he did, it definitly wouldn't have been his fault) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V4SwZkq1O8 Begbie ...Ben Baggie; the ideal goalkeeper which you seem to be describing is one who is consistent, reliable and composed. Given this, I cannot believe that you are trying to put Ben Foster into this category; a goalkeeper who frequently makes a hash of 'routine' goalkeeping and who is constantly tense. He was allowed to leave Old Trafford because when he was given a chance in the first team he made a series of nervous errors; he was all over the place, and with all respect he couldn't handle the pressure. I simply could not put the words 'composed' and 'reliable' alongside 'Ben Foster'. However, he is a fine shot-stopper. In fact, Foster is a perfect example of the 'hero' goalkeeper whose reputation has been founded on great shot-stopping performances, rather than solidity. 'Fools', as you call them. Whilst I don't disagree with every point you make, your central argument is, I think, wrong. Having been a goalkeeper for many years, I think I can say with confidence that goalkeeping is actually mainly about presence. This is both the mental fortitude which you alluded to with Joe Hart's arrogance and the physical size to intimidate strikers and cover the goal more easily. I agree that the right technique does make things easier, and being composed helps with decision making. But you simply cannot disregard the physical aspect of goalkeeping. Seaman was a great keeper but in the last five or six years of his career he turned into something of an embarrassment, because whilst his technique, reliability and composure were still there, he became cumbersome and immobile. For my money, Van der Sar and Cech are both easily the best Premier League goalkeepers of the last ten years, for whilst they possessed all of the technique and composure which you hold in such regard, they were also big, physical keepers who possessed the raw goalkeeping attributes, such as agility and quick reflexes. In the final analysis, saving shots is what goalkeeping is about. I can only hope that your tongue has spent much of its time in your cheek.

778,"It will take much more than a last-16 triumph over mediocre Championship opponents to make amends for the events of recent weeks, of course. Roberto Mancini has seen his sides title defence left in ruins after a woeful run of just two points from the last three games. He was on a hiding to nothing here and knew the best he could hope for was that the Blues beat whatever was put in front of them. Leeds were no match for the top-flight giants who breezed into the quarter-finals to provide Mancini with some light relief thanks to goals from Yaya Toure, Carlos Tevez and Sergio Agueros double. City won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for a trophy. And such is the mounting pressure on the Italian that he might have to land it again in May if he wants to extend his stay with the billionaires beyond the summer. With the vultures circling, Mancini knew there could be no slip-ups here. Last weeks humiliating 3-1 defeat at Southampton saw City fall 12 points behind Manchester United in the title race. This was Mancinis last hope of landing some silverware this season and he wielded the axe as promised, making six changes. Among those left out were Joe Hart, Joleon Lescott, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko, while Gareth Barry was sidelined with injury. Mancini recalled Tevez, who had been missing on compassionate leave, along with Toure, his brother Kolo and left-back Aleksandar Kolarov. Opposite number Neil Warnock found himself in a similar domestic situation, knowing Leeds chances of promotion were slim at best and that this was the last hurrah of the campaign. Yet any hopes Warnock had of a famous victory were dead and buried within the first 15 minutes. Mancinis men looked right up for the fight from the off and the champions tore into Leeds like their lives depended on it. They took the lead inside five minutes when Tevezs clever flick sent Toure past a static Leeds defence and he rounded Jamie Ashdown before finishing into an open goal. David Silva then lashed a powerful drive inches wide before Agueros clever run and unselfish pass set up Tevez, but his effort curled into the side netting. The writing was on the wall and it spelt serious danger for Leeds, who went 2-0 down inside 14 minutes when referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the home side a soft spot-kick. Tom Lees was attempting to challenge Aguero but Clattenburg penalised him for pulling back the Argentine, even though replays suggested he had merely brushed his arm across his chest. Aguero picked himself up to beat Ashdown and double Citys advantage. The one-way traffic continued with Sam Byram almost diverting Kolarovs free-kick into his own goal before Toure lashed a piledriver inches over. Warnock stood on the sidelines looking perplexed, powerless to stop the blue waves crashing into his defence as the pressure kept piling up. Javi Garcia flashed a header just wide and Leeds were relieved to get to half-time just a couple of goals down. Warnock replaced ex-City midfielder Michael Brown and Ross McCormack with Steve Morison and David Norris at the restart in the hope it would give his side a foothold. But within seven minutes the Elland Road underdogs found themselves even further behind when Tevez pounced to extend the lead. Aguero was the provider this time, exchanging clever passes with the impressive Silva before picking out Tevez who finished from point-blank range. James Milner, facing his home-town club, then fired into the side netting as Mancinis men went up through the gears. Sub Jack Rodwell was given a rare 30 minutes to shine but managed to hit the bar instead of score with a simple header soon after replacing Garcia. Chances at the opposite end were like gold dust but Luke Varney wasted a good one with 19 minutes left when his header looped over from close range.",Raw Data

781,"Just as it's been from the day he walked in the door, Prince's steady contributions often go overlooked but not unappreciated by those who study the game most closely. There are so many peaks and valleys in an NBA season and right now the Pistons, with their new lineup and new rotation, are at something of a peak. You have to be happy for the young players getting a chance, especially Greg Monroe, and the renaissance man, Tracy McGrady. You also have to feel for Rip Hamilton, who at least for the moment is out of the rotation, probably for the first time since he started playing basketball. I certainly appreciate everything Rip has done for the Pistons and I know his teammate, Tayshaun Prince, does, too. When you think about it, Tayshaun has been the mainstay this season. And with the exception of last year, when he finally missed a game, he’s been a cornerstone for this franchise it seems like forever. He’s an underrated player – but not in the eyes of coaches or scouts or other players. I think fans sometimes overlook the incredible overall ability Tayshaun has. He’s been in double figures all but seven games this season and he doesn’t really look to score unless his team needs him to score. This season, they’ve needed it more than in the past. I think he’ll average over 15 points a game this season without calling for the ball or demanding a shot. Tonight against Boston, he’ll almost assuredly go over 8,000 career points – he needs just five to get there. I just like the fact he can do so many things. He’s always asked to cover an exceptional scorer. Paul Pierce will be his assignment in this game, and you don’t always succeed when you’re guarding somebody like that, but – believe me – he slows them down. He’s had a 12-rebound game, an eight-assist game, we know he’s a shot-blocker – rare at the small forward position – and he’s scored over 30 in games this season. When you really look at Tayshaun as an offensive threat, he’s a guy that is probably going to score if you don’t give the defender some help. He’s so calm, cool and collected – that’s the beauty of watching him play. When he gets the ball, no matter what the situation, no matter how critical the possession, he knows how much time he has and he knows what he has to do. And, like a surgeon, he cuts up the defender. He’s so precise. I can’t tell you how many clutch shots I’ve seen him make. He makes a lot of moves without looking at the basket – he only looks at the basket at the last split second when he’s in a one-on-one situation, and he still usually gets nothing but net. In my profession, I get an incredible opportunity not many people have – I can watch the greatest players in the world perform night in and night out. When you only watch one team throughout a season, you get a good glimpse of the rest of the league but a terrific look at the guys in Pistons uniforms. There’s a short list of players who can do what Tayshaun can do. It’s been a privilege to watch him play all these years. I’ve always thought he had more ability than the average guy can see if you don’t watch him over time. He can be the perfect complementary player, but he can be a big-time option down the stretch if you need him to be that. I’ve watched Tayshaun since he played at Kentucky. When I broadcast Michigan State games for a few seasons in addition to doing Pistons games, I saw him play at the Breslin Center and it struck me that he just always knew how to play the game. Whatever his team has needed, he’s always seemed ready and able to do it. I’ve seen that during his entire time with the Pistons – a guy who not only understands the game, he understands the situation. It’s always a pleasure to see the results. I like guys who don’t get flustered – as I put it, guys who can’t be bothered – and he’s clearly one of them. And that’s easier said than done. He started out as a guy known for his defense, which is remarkable for an NBA rookie, and I think that’s where he earned his playing time. There’s no doubt everybody’s offensive game evolves, but I think Tayshaun had a lot of it from the beginning. He just wasn’t asked to use it and he was patient about it. He knew his time would come and it has. He’s always been out winning and competing for championships. The run he and the Pistons core group had was incredible. I know that nobody wanted to play them. If you stopped them in one area, it opened the floodgates in another. As this transitional era for the Pistons continues, with the ups and downs you would expect, it’s been a pleasure for me to watch one of the constants, Tayshaun Prince.",Raw Data
782,"ARSENE WENGER thinks Olivier Giroud is getting ready to rumble and Arsenal are beginning to reap the rewards of the fired-up Frenchman. The man from Montpellier has taken time to settle at the Emirates Stadium following his summer switch. But his two goals on Saturday coming four days after his double against West Ham took his seasons tally to 14. Not bad for a player finding his feet in a new country. Not that Giroud thought he would have any problems adapting to life in the Premier League. As far as the striker is concerned, he has always been destined to play in England where a bit of rough and tumble is still part of the game. The only possible surprise is that the big, powerful centre foward has found a natural home at Arsenal, the club where star strikers have been more likely to break the mould than batter a centre-half. Wenger admits he shifted from his normal policy when he picked out Giroud as the successor to Robin van Persie. But recent performances suggest it could be a much neater fit than first imagined during a difficult start to the season. Wenger said: When he gets in the fighting mode he is difficult to handle. He is tall, strong, he is quicker than people think he is. He could have played 20 years ago in England, 10 years ago and today, because he has everything you need to play centre-forward. Usually we go more for mobile players who are just on the move, but he gives us something different, and I believe with him and Theo Walcott we have a good partnership. Without him up front today it would have been difficult. It is no coincidence that Giroud and Walcott were not at Bradford. We had a lot of the ball but we did not score. Giroud said: I chose this championship because there is more intensity, more physicality, you have to be ready in an athletic way. I like it but I like to play good football as well. And after sitting on the bench in recent weeks while Walcott was given a run up front, Giroud reckons the past few days have been an important stage in his Gunners career. He added: Ive had a lot of time to play. I had a difficult time a couple of weeks ago when I didnt play a lot so I had to keep confident, keep going. We want to get six points against Liverpool and Stoke now to reach Tottenham and fourth place. Then we will play and see where we get. Girouds goals certainly didnt come from brute force alone and helped spare Wenger an embarrassing inquest into his decision to leave Walcott and Jack Wilshere on the bench. The striker showed a superb touch to twice put Arsenal ahead, first with a curling leftfoot shot and then with a neat piece of control and cool finish. Brighton rallied on both occasions through Ashley Barnes header and a strike from debutant Leonardo Ulloa. But the Premier League side avoided a replay and booked a place in the fifth round through Walcotts deflected winner six minutes from time. Brighton boss Gus Poyet agreed Giroud was too much for his defence to handle but hopes Ulloa the Argentine striker signed from Almeria last week can learn from watching the Frenchman. He said: Giroud was very strong. At Championship level, Leo should give us that power, holding and strength. We lost and I dont like it but it was a good start for Leo, he scored, he was feeling the atmosphere which was incredible at that time and well see where that takes us.",Raw Data
783,"Somewhere, in a parallel dimension, when cyclist Tyler Hamilton appears on live video link beamed in to a court room in the Spanish city of Madrid on Tuesday, his testimony detailing the breadth and impunity of doping within his sport would send shock waves across the world. But, in the here and now, such is the public's current fatigue of drug revelations in sport that his appearance at the trial of the Operation Puerto scandal -- where Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes is accused of masterminding a blood doping network at the highest level of professional cycling -- will be met with little more than a collective shrug. Hamilton was an American cyclist who won a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics before riding with Lance Armstrong in the Tour de France. He has already detailed his own drug-taking exploits in his book ""The Secret Race,"" helping to lift the lid on the murky, dangerous and in some cases criminal world of performance-enhancing drugs. But those revelations -- which implicated Armstrong as much as himself -- were just the tip of the iceberg. Read: Armstrong immortalized in graffiti 'doping' artwork Doping club was like a badge of honor Hamilton: Lance 'never super apologetic' Journalist's crusade to expose Armstrong From Armstrong's carefully managed but ultimately soulless confession to doping fraud on Oprah to the release of a damning report by the Australian Crime Commission -- the government's top criminal intelligence body -- in to widespread doping in some of the country's top sports and the ongoing Operation Puerto trial, the fidelity of sportsmen and women is increasingly being called into question. ""I don't think anything has changed, there have been doping cheats in sports for a long, long time, and there are still doping cheats in sports,"" John Fahey, president of the World Anti Doping Agency, told CNN. ""What we are seeing in more recent days is a number of revelations which give us some sort of indication that, in some cases, it's quite widespread. I think we now know there was a period in cycling where it was extremely widespread."" Poachers versus gamekeepers But while the reputation of sports stars has taken a hit, the people charged with catching them -- the various different governing bodies and, at the top, WADA -- remain one step behind the dopers. Armstrong, after all, claimed correctly that he never failed a drugs test. Yet for the man who heads the world's top anti-doping body, the revelations are a move in the right direction, rather than proof of failure. ""Has cycling fixed itself up? Well, I don't know,"" admitted Fahey, before suggesting that the revelations ""makes us all think about the problem, and that's not such a bad thing."" There are still doping cheats in sports John Fahey ""I would much sooner see all of these things about doping in sport on the surface than to know that there was doping in sport and we don't know about it,"" he added. Read: Armstrong admits doping Despite the public's doping fatigue, the revelations that have emerged from the Operation Puerto trial so far have been shocking. Fuentes has been accused, along with his sister and three other defendants from various other cycling teams, of running a blood doping ring that involved transfusions of re-oxygenated blood. I hope this may well be the final court case that we have to participate in John Fahey Blood doping involves using hormones or transfusions to boost the numbers of red cells in the body. This can increase a sportsman or woman's ability to carry oxygen to the muscles, a distinct advantage in endurance sports. Hotel transfusion Several top names in cycling have been implicated. According to a 2006 report in Spanish newspaper El Pais Tyler Hamilton paid Fuentes at least $47,000 for the procedure. But doping wasn't a criminal offence in Spain in 2006 when Fuentes was arrested and hundreds of bags of blood from his clients seized. Instead they have been accused of endangering public health, charges they deny. WADA's own medical expert Dr. Yorck Olaf Schumacher gave a damning appraisal of the health risks that many of the cyclists faced when he testified in Spain, according to Cycling News website which is covering the trial. ""Extracting half a liter or a liter of blood presents a greater risk than extracting the usual amounts. That's up to 20% of the body's total, whereas you would only extract 1% for a blood analysis,"" he said. Livestrong without Armstrong Aussie doping tied to organized crime Armstrong: I doped for Tour de France ""A hotel does not fulfill the conditions required for a transfusion,"" he added, referring to the alleged unsanitary conditions in which the blood doping took place. ""A cool bag for picnics isn't the best thing for transporting blood."" Schumacher also raised the possibility that cyclists would have been exposed to greater risk of contracting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. ""We've been fighting this case now for the best part of seven years,"" said Fahey, before turning his attentions to other sports. ""Those hundreds of blood bags that appear to belong to many different types of sportsmen and women, so (it's) not just one sport. We want to know who they are, we want to know what's in those bags, and all of that knowledge and information passed on to the authorities that will take action against the owners of that blood."" Soccer stars implicated? Many of the names attached to those damning, currently anonymous blood bags could contain the names of well-known soccer players. During the trial Fuentes told the court that he had many clients in the world of soccer, athletics and boxing. But the judge ruled that Fuentes would not be compelled to reveal names. Fuentes' revelations have not gone unnoticed by WADA officials, who believe soccer's governing body FIFA could do much more to tackle alleged doping in the game -- particularly the use of EPO, or erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidney that is injected to stimulate red blood cell production that has long been used by cyclists. ""I acknowledge that under the world body, FIFA, there is an anti-doping program,"" said Fahey. ""They can do more, they've got to test players, many more of them, and make sure they are testing for the drug of choice EPO. Otherwise they are paying lip service to the issue rather than convincing anybody that they've got an effective program."" A cool bag for picnics isn't the best thing for transporting blood Dr. Yorck Olaf Schumacher The answer, according to Fahey, is to insist on a biological profile and passport for each player, an issue he raised with Sepp Blatter, the secretary general of FIFA, when they met last week. FIFA announced after that meeting that it will introduce biological profiles at June's Confederations Cup tournament in Brazil. The scheme will see a biological profile taken from each player two months before so that any marked changes in that profile at the tournament could point to blood doping or hormone use. ""I would like to see, particularly team sports, take up the athlete's biological passport,"" Fahey said. ""There is absolutely no reason why in the major codes of football, and in the major sporting events right throughout the world they shouldn't all (have) the tool known as the biological passport. That will do a lot to stamp out doping in sport, and most of those major codes can easily afford the cost of running that program."" But, for now, the focus remains on cycling, Operation Puerto, Fuentes and Tyler Hamilton's testimony. Fahey hopes that the trial will be a watershed moment for doping in sport. ""This is not the first court case that we've had on this subject over the past seven years, but we will continue to exhaust all legal rights,"" Fahey said. ""We believe it is important enough to do that. I hope this may well be the final court case that we have to participate in.""",Raw Data
784,"A week after a report surfaced that Tiger Woods was interested in remarrying ex-wife Elin Nordegren, numerous reports Wednesday said that the golfer is actually involved in a romantic relationship with Olympic and world champion skier Lindsey Vonn. With new dating rumors surrounding Tiger, look back at some of the women with whom he was linked to before his divorce. The Daily Mail reported that the two began dating in November of last year and that the 37-year-old Woods recently took a romantic getaway with the 28-year-old Vonn in Antigua and subsequently visited her in Austria, where she was competing, earlier this month. Sports Illustrated also confirmed Woods' trip to Austria to see Vonn. In December, the Denver Post quoted Vonn as denying any romantic relationship with Woods. However, Hollywood Life on Wednesday reported that the ski slopes are where the two met, and quoted a source close to Vonn as saying, ""Lindsey has been teaching Tiger’s kids Sam and Charlie how to ski."" Woods' reign as the world's top golfer — and one of the most sought-after pitchmen in sports — came to a screeching halt after his private life unraveled after he crashed his SUV following an argument with Nordegren on Thanksgiving night 2009. As the details of his various extramarital affairs reached the mainstream, he and Nordegren divorced in August 2010. Vonn is a four-time World Cup champion and three-time Olympian. Considered by many to be the greatest American female skier of all time, she won gold in downhill and bronze in super G at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was married once before, to 2002 US Olympic teammate Thomas Vonn. The two married in September 2007, and their divorce was finalized earlier this year.",Raw Data
785,"Serena Williams delivers an on court interview as she withdraws from her match on the third day of the Dubai event. World No. 1 says back problem has troubled her for the past fortnight American targets next month's Sony Ericsson Open in Miami for comeback (CNN) -- Hours after losing Victoria Azarenka to injury, organizers of the Dubai Tennis Championships were dealt another major blow on Wednesday when Serena Williams also pulled out of the event. The 31-year-old Williams, who became the oldest women's tennis player to be crowned world No. 1 on Monday, said she was forced out because of a back injury. ""I've just had some back problems the past couple of weeks,"" the American told an impromptu press conference. ""I thought it would get better as the week went on but it didn't. I don't want to keep pushing it and make it worse."" Williams took to the court to apologize to fans who had arrived for her second-round match with Marion Bartoli of France. The absences of both Williams and previous No. 1 Azarenka represent a severe dent to a popular $2 million tournament which had already been without the sport's two reported highest earners, Maria Sharapova and Li Na (according to Forbes magazine). It is also a blow to the Women's Tennis Association, which has worked hard to introduce incentives and regulations to reduce the number of withdrawals from its events. Wednesday's unexpected withdrawal follows that of second-ranked Azarenka, which ensured that Williams will hang on to top spot until the Sony Ericsson Open, which starts in Miami on March 18. Read: Azarenka out of Dubai Open Williams said her back also troubled her in last week's Qatar Open, where she was beaten in the final by the Belorussian, who withdrew from the Dubai championships with a foot injury. The 15-time grand slam winner added that, having returned to the pinnacle after two and a half years during which her life and career were threatened following a freak foot injury in 2010, being No. 1 is no longer her primary goal. ""OK, I have done it, let's focus on my next goals which are the grand slams,"" Williams said, admitting that she already had at least half an eye on the French Open in Paris, starting on May 26. ""I really want to continue doing really well in those."" After winning Wimbledon and the US Open last year, Williams' total of grand slam titles is only three fewer than Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, who together are second on the all-time list behind Steffi Graf with 22. Williams' absence increases the chances of world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska making a successful defense of her title, which began with the Pole grinding out a 7-, 6-3 win over Yulia Putintseva, a promising 18-year-old wild card entry from Kazakhstan. Bartoli, who received a wild-card invite after making a late entry, will face former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals.

787,"Two years before golf returns to the Olympics, the LPGA Tour is creating a tournament to determine the best in the world. Stacy Lewis is defending Player of the Year, so she's one of the LPGA Tour players to watch in 2013. The International Crown will start in 2014 and be played every other year. It will feature four days of team matches among eight countries that can field the strongest four-player teams based on the world rankings. The inaugural event will be in late July at Caves Valley Golf Club outside Baltimore. ''We have a tour designed to identify the best player in the world. The Olympics will award the best female golfer and country,'' LPGA Tour commissioner Mike Whan said Thursday. ''But we have nothing that addresses which country is building the best stable of women's golfers.'' He announced the new event at the PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, Fla. As much as the International Crown has an Olympic flavor, it might be more closely related to the Solheim Cup, which for years did not include the best players in women's golf because it was only for Americans and Europeans. Among those who never played were Karrie Webb of Australia, Se Ri Pak of South Korea, Lorena Ochoa of Mexico and Yani Tseng of Taiwan. Whan said the players would be in uniforms of their country, free of corporate sponsorships. The purse will be $1.6 million, with $400,000 going to the winning team. It also will be played in the middle of the LPGA Tour season, when players are in form for the majors and media interest is higher than it would be at the end of the year. The tournament also brings a new format to golf, breaking away from the routine of 72-hole events. The eight teams will be divided into two brackets, and every team in each bracket will face each other over three days of fourball matches. Five teams will advance to the final round of singles matches, with the points carrying over. The fifth team will be determined by a playoff between each of the countries that finish third in their brackets. Each country will be required to submit a name in an envelope of the player who would compete in the playoff — to determine the fifth finalist, and if a playoff is needed to determine the overall winner. ''At the LPGA, we celebrate great players from all over the world on a weekly basis, but this is the first time we'll pit country versus country for global bragging rights,'' Whan said. Still, the International Crown inevitable will shut out some of the best players. Suzann Pettersen is No. 6 in the world, but Norway only has two players among the top 500 in the world, and thus would not be eligible if it were held this year. Sheshan Feng, the first Chinese player to win a major last year, also would not have enough teammates to be one of the eight countries. Based on this week's world ranking, three players from the top 15 would not be eligible — Pettersen, Feng and Catriona Matthew of Scotland. ''I was talking about this last year with Suzann Pettersen and she said, 'I like the idea, but aren't you building something I'm not going to be in?' '' Whan said. ''It's an interesting situation. But we don't need another event to identify the best in the world. Our tour does that.'' The LPGA Tour years ago had the Lexus Cup, which was designed for the players who couldn't compete in the Solheim Cup. It never gained much traction, however, with Asia competing against the rest of the world. Whan found it to be far more compelling to have players competing for their own country. ''I've been asked many times whether we should add other countries or regions to the Solheim Cup,'' he said. ''One thing you learn quickly as commissioner when you go to the Solheim Cup is you're not going to mess with that. . . . Korea wants to play Japan, not be teammates. This gives the fans what they want.'' While it will be a global competition, it will probably be staged in the United States. After the inaugural event Caves Valley, it will move to Rich Harvest Farms west of Chicago - site of the 2009 Solheim Cup — for 2016. Whan said it would be played in July, which is the heart of the LPGA Tour's domestic schedule. ''Our tour is so global and we need this type of event,'' said Stacy Lewis, the LPGA Tour's player of the year. ''People always want to know why golfers from Asia are so good. Well, now we can see how all the countries stack up.'",Raw Data

Millsaps holeshotted his RM-Z450 Suzuki in the 20-lap Main Event - watched by a crowd of 55,000 at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington - and, apart from losing the race lead to defending Champion Ryan Villopoto, rode fast and faultlessly. Said Millsaps: ""It was a fabulous, wonderful, amazing 20 laps. I won my heat race, then got the holeshot in the Main and got second. I'm very happy about that!"" Wharton, who was forced to LCQ, went into the Lites Main Event with the second-to-last gate pick. He narrowly missed the holeshot and rode 15 smart laps aboard his RM-Z350 to finish in second position behind Scotland's Dean Wilson. Said Wharton: ""I've been watching in the west but it's been a while since I've raced. It's always nice to get that first one out of the way. Dallas is nice because I know a lot of people here, but it's Supercross so it's always intense. Practice was a little rough, the heat race was a little rougher. I had to go to the LCQ - no one really ever likes that. I think you lose life when you go to the LCQ. It's not healthy even if you win. I feel like I've aged! Fortunately I won that and I went to the Main with a bad gate pick - well I guess I wouldn't say bad gate - but no one is going to go there with their first choice. I somehow almost got the holeshot so that was pretty good. I just rode a solid 15 laps. I'm going to want to do things different next weekend, but I still want to be up there.""",Raw Data
789,"As I look forward to the weekend’s games for the Pistons at Miami and then Sunday against the Knicks in Madison Square Garden, I can’t help but think back to the first preseason game when we played the Heat – the first game for Dwyane Wade with his new teammates, LeBron James and Chris Bosh – and how it was also the first game for Tracy McGrady with the Pistons. It’s amazing to think back, even though it was really only a little more than three months ago, how much of a difference you can see now with Tracy. He was disappointed in how his legs responded in that game and figured he better not play any more in the season and now … well, now Tracy McGrady is one of the unquestioned leaders of this team. It’s been fun to watch his progress from week to week as he gets healthier and the level of his play just keeps going up and up along with it. And let’s not forget – he had a lot to come back from. I don’t know if everybody in the league thought he could, but obviously Joe D did – or at least he thought there was a darn good chance of it. When you bet on somebody making their recovery, you’re also betting on them and their mental toughness, their drive and their willingness to work at it. And T-Mac obviously has all of that on his side. Then don’t forget the unbelievable skill of Arnie Kander, who has made Tracy one of his pet projects. He told us all along that the time will come – just let us do what we need to do to get him back on the court. To see him make the transition to point guard has been equally amazing. I thought he would score and not turn it over and make good decisions. I thought he’d play some shooting guard and some small forward. And I thought he would quite possibly turn out to be an important part of the rotation. But I’ll admit, for him to become such a rock for this team at point guard was more than I ever envisioned. I think it speaks to the fact that too many people around the NBA – maybe not the decision-makers, necessarily, but too many others – write off older players. Tracy’s not all that old. Let’s remember, he’s only 31 and should have some prime years ahead of him if his health doesn’t let him down. But when the injuries hit, I think a lot of people figured that was too much to overcome. But the guy did win two scoring titles and played in umpteen All-Star games. He has great skill. He’s a smart player who learned his lessons well over the years. I think he thought if he could get his legs and his body back into game shape, somehow he would still have something to give – and he’s proven that. When you’re the point guard, as Tracy has become over time and now taken over as the starter, you’re like the quarterback. Quarterbacks are leaders. If they aren’t, their team really isn’t going to be able to play up to its potential. Same thing goes for point guards. Your job is to recognize everybody’s strengths and allow them to operate in a comfort zone. That involves so much timing and decision making. It’s really not that much different than being a quarterback. It’s very hard to win without a good point guard. When you have a point guard who has been and still is a scorer, you have somebody who understands exactly what his teammates need. For T-Mac to step up and say “my guys,” as I heard him say over the past two weeks about his teammates, is a great sign. That means he enjoys playing with these guys, he’s proud of what they’ve accomplished and is more than willing to make himself a true part of this team. You’ve got to give Tracy all the credit in the world for accepting the role as the point guard. If he wanted to prove he was worthy of a far bigger contract next year – let’s not forget, he signed with the Pistons for the veteran’s minimum – and maybe the year after, scoring would have been the quickest way to prove that. But I don’t think it’s about the money with him. I don’t think it’s about anything but being able to play basketball at the highest level and make a significant contribution. When I’ve seen players that have been hurt over the years after they’ve been stars, the ability to come back and play is a gift and they know that and it’s clear Tracy knows that. I’ll bet you that making more money next year or the year after hasn’t really crossed his mind. I’m sure playing next year and the year after has crossed his mind and he’s proven he can do that. The Pistons are lucky to have him.",Raw Data
790,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Blake Griffin had 23 points and nine assists and the Los Angeles Clippers ended a four-game losing streak with a 96-83 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. The Clippers have the third-best record in the NBA at 33-13, 2 games behind San Antonio. Eric Bledsoe had 10 points, five assists and five rebounds in his seventh start as point guard. Chris Paul missed his fourth straight game and seventh in the past nine because of a bruised right kneecap. Lamar Odom had eight points, 13 rebounds and six assists. All-Star forward LaMarcus Aldridge led the Trail Blazers with 21 points and 11 rebounds. It was Portland's seventh loss in nine games, and it came in the second part of a home-and-home set with the Clippers. Portland never led in the second half on Sunday, falling behind 74-59 after a driving layup by Bledsoe with 3:15 left in the third quarter. Griffin didn't play after going to the bench with 10 seconds left in the third quarter and the Clippers leading 78-62. But they built the margin to as many as 19 points on a layup by forward Ronny Turiaf with 6:23 remaining. Griffin powered the Clippers to a 55-50 halftime lead with 15 points, including a fast break dunk off a long pass from DeAndre Jordan just before intermission. Griffin had an assist on six of their first nine baskets, including Jordan's alley-oop dunk and 3-pointers by Caron Butler and Matt Barnes. Los Angeles was leading 46-40 when Butler's fadeaway 3-pointer from in front of the Clippers' bench was disallowed because of an offensive foul called against him with 4:31 remaining in the second quarter. Butler picked up his third foul just 14 seconds later, but remained in the game until he was removed by coach Vinny Del Negro with 3:16 left in the half. NOTES: The Trail Blazers had 25 assists on their first 26 baskets. ... Bledsoe played 36 minutes without committing a turnover. ... Los Angeles outscored Portland 56-24 in the paint. ... The Clippers head out on a seven-game road trip. ... The Clippers shot 51.2 percent, and are 14-1 when shooting at least 50 percent.",Raw Data
791,"The way the Champions League knockout stage is organised is taking the buzz out of big European nights, and indicates a move to a continental super league. The last 16 has been spread out over a month, with the first and second legs broken up over a fortnight each. You get two games on a Tuesday, two on a Wednesday, and a week before the other two matches are played. Then they do it all over again. And when you consider how long the group stages go on for – and the sprawling mess that is the Europa League – everything points to the end-game: a season-long European Premier League and Championship. Red Star Belgrade won the European Cup in 1991; Sporting Lisbon won the Cup Winners' Cup …Fans hark back to the knockout format, when every game was make-or-break and unfancied sides from Eastern Europe or Belgium could go on amazing runs and reach a final or even win it. But the fans clearly don’t matter. There was a token nod to what we wanted when they abolished the hastily-introduced ‘double group stage’ after much complaints. But it was a token withdrawal as the solution was just to drag the knockout phase out over a month, which is what we’re seeing at the moment. In terms of timeframes and excitement, it’s more like a mini-league than a knockout. If anything they realised the second group stage was a step too soon for the fans, and that they needed to ‘phase in’ their plan to expand the tournaments, meanwhile making the Europa League even more bloated. Remember when you had four to eight Champions League matches on the same night? It was so exciting, there was such a buzz about it - no matter how hard you tried, you couldn’t keep an eye on everything so there was always a surprise when a goal went in somewhere. But it’s not in UEFA’s interests to have the fans excited, passionate – it’s in their interest to have as many matchdays as possible, so they can eke out every last drop of advertising and sponsorship revenue from the televised games. When the matches are on at different times and different days, more people can watch individual matches and the income for UEFA increases. Which is nice for them. About 20 years ago most people laughed off the idea of a continental league system, but no-one’s laughing now. And it’s not just European club football that is following this model. The European Championships is being played all over Europe. UEFA say it’s a one-off but I don’t think so. Again, it’s great for revenue – more casual fans will be able to attend individual matches, which plays into the hands of corporate hospitality and maximising UEFA’s brand over as many countries as possible. But again, the ‘real’ fans will be hurt. Real fans of national teams travel en masse to tournaments, camping out or staying in hostels or whatever they can afford, attending every match in huge numbers and giving the support and passion the Euros or a World Cup deserve. What we will now see is these Euros games being more like home friendlies or qualifiers, with loads of occasional fans eating hot dogs and getting the tube home afterwards. Meanwhile, the hardcore travelling supporters will be completely priced out of following their team from the groups to the final. You’d have to be a millionaire to be able to afford to hop about 13 different countries in a month – and millionaires don’t always make the best football fans. And it doesn’t just extend to continental and international football – you can see it happening in England too. The FA Cup is increasingly being shunted towards a midweek format, so it can be separated from the Premier League at weekends, while the League Cup gets marginalised even further. Why did Manchester United play Reading on Monday night? Why wasn’t that on a Sunday? Why is Chelsea’s match with Middlesbrough on a Wednesday? Last year’s final was a late afternoon kick-off, and this year’s will be at 5.30pm. Why? Because it’s Saturday night prime time. Who cares about the travelling fans, about the joy of watching an FA Cup final on a sunny afternoon. It’s all about telly. There’s a wider agenda at play here, a method to the madness. Club football will go on most of the year, with marginal breaks, but tournaments spread out. The same applies for international tournaments. League formats are less exciting, less ‘buzzy’ than the intensity of knockout competition, but the authorities don’t care. It’s easy to say ‘TV is ruining football’, but the tail is wagging the dog. TV money revolutionised the game in England first and Europe is following suit. Fair enough. But they have to remember who pays in the first place and, with attendances dwindling and fans of top flight clubs becoming less interested by the year, there is a danger people could get bored and just walk away from it. One thing in England’s favour is that it doesn’t really affect Championship clubs and below, and that we have a deep passion for lower league football. Perhaps real football fans will start supporting these teams, their local teams, in even greater numbers. But it’s a big maybe. As it stands fans of Premier League clubs could soon find themselves going for a month or more without seeing their team play at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. Do we accept this because of the benefits – which arguably won’t trickle down to the clubs that much – or do we stamp our feet and demand change? Money rules over the majority, and I feel there’s nothing we can do about it.",Raw Data
792,"After being trialled at the Club World Cup in December, FIFA have decided to roll it out at this summer's Confederation's Cup and next year's World Cup. FIFA said in a statement: ""After a successful implementation of Goal-Line Technology (GLT) at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan in December 2012, FIFA has decided to use GLT at the FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 and 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. ""The aim is to use GLT in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia, pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests. ""With different technologies on the market, FIFA has launched a tender today, setting out the technical requirements for the two forthcoming competitions in Brazil."" Fans have previously demanded that FIFA president Sepp Blatter bring in the technology after England were denied a goal in their defeat to Germany at the 2010 World Cup. A shot from Frank Lampard hit the underside of the crossbar and replays showed it clearly crossed the line, but Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda did not award a goal, which would have been an equaliser. Tennis and cricket at the highest level already feature the use of technology, with umpires and players able to turn to replays of key incidents for clarification. Blatter said at the Club World Cup that FIFA would follow suit.",Raw Data
793,"Nishikori needed only 67 minutes to improve to 3-2 in finals. He won his first career title in Delray Beach in 2008. Seeded fifth, Nishikori was the only seed to reach the weekend. The 23-year-old finished the tournament without dropping a set in taking the $291,800 winner's check, and he is expected to move from No. 22 in the ATP rankings to No. 16. He's 11-2 this year. Lopez, who beat Nishikori in April 2011 in Barcelona on clay, was looking for his own third career ATP title and first since Johannesburg in February 2010. At 31, Lopez was playing in his eighth career final with a chance to become the oldest player on tour this season to win. A victory would have moved him into the top 30 in rankings from No. 47 at the start of this week. The Spaniard led the tournament with 38 aces, including eight in the final. But he also had three double-faults. Nishikori broke Lopez twice in the Spaniard's first three service games to go up 4-1 in the first set. Nishikori also broke him again to start the second, even though Lopez pushed the game to deuce and even had the advantage. Lopez couldn't close it out, and Nishikori got the advantage back with a forehand down the line and then a backhand passing shot. Lopez tried to rally in the second game in his best chance to break Nishikori, jumping out to a 40-0 lead off the Japanese's serve. Then Lopez hit a couple forehands long, and he lost a challenge that a Nishikori shot had been long only to have replay show it touched the back edge of the line for deuce. Nishikori won the next two points to go up 2-0. Then Nishikori finished off the match efficiently serving out before breaking Lopez one last time for the title. Lopez came to the net, and Nishikori answered with a backhand passing shot to reach 15-40. Lopez had a cross court winner, then hit a backhand that went wide. Nishikori saw the ball going wide, dropped the racket and raised his arms in celebration.",Raw Data
794,"As you step through the red side door at Starrett City Boxing Club, the smell hits you like a glove full of plaster. The odor of sweat, blood and hot air fill the cavernous, cement-walled room, located underneath a parking garage at a housing complex in Brooklyn. These babes can't get enough ringside action. Ringside cheerleaders Bantamweight babes Best ring girls The folks who call this facility home will tell you that’s the scent of hard work, and as you look at some of the fighters this place has produced, many of them world champs, you can’t help but think that maybe they’re onto something. The list of boxers who got their start at Starrett City is long and accomplished: Mean Joe Green, Monte Barrett, Shannon Briggs, Travis Simms, Luis Collazo, Curtis Stevens, Sadam Ali, Will Rosinsky, Dimitry Salita, Jaidon Codrington — all products of Jimmy O’Pharrow’s gym. So is Danny Jacobs, better known here as The Golden Child. Jacobs grew up in Brownsville, the neighborhood that bred former world champs Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe, and started working with trainer Victor Roundtree at Starrett City at age 14. After a quick ascent up the amateur ranks, Jacobs made his professional debut in 2007 as a 20-year-old on the undercard of a Floyd Mayweather-Ricky Hatton fight in Las Vegas. In December 2009, ESPN named Jacobs — then a perfect 18-0 — its prospect of the year, and seven months later Jacobs took a 20-0 mark into his first title fight, a WBO middleweight bout against undefeated Russian Dmitry Pirog. Jacobs would lose that fight, in large part, he says, because the death of his grandmother earlier that week had taken his focus off the match. Jacobs knew his career had been dealt a major blow as a result of the knockout, and he was prepared for a difficult climb back to the top of the boxing world. But even he couldn’t have known how treacherous the journey would be. Because shortly after the loss to Pirog, Jacobs learned he wouldn’t just be fighting for another title shot — he would be fighting for his life. Weird feeling in leg Jacobs rebounded from the loss with two wins — in December 2010 and in March 2011 — and his career seemed to be getting back on track. But in late March, Jacobs returned from a week-long Middle East USO tour with fellow boxers Oscar De La Hoya, Adrien Broner and Seth Mitchell and noticed a weird feeling in his left leg. It wasn’t so much that the leg hurt, but it felt weak. Soon, Jacobs began to feel similar symptoms in his right leg, and before long getting around had become difficult. Jacobs often found himself tripping over his own feet when he walked. Doctors told him it was likely a side effect of a pinched nerve. “I thought it was something like sciatica, where it could be easily fixed,” Jacobs said. “So in my mind, day to day, I didn’t feel like it was a big deal. I was even joking about it with my girlfriend. I’d run and my legs are all over the place while I’m running, so we’re making fun of it, not knowing that I’m dying.” In a matter of weeks Jacobs’ condition deteriorated into a dire situation. By early May, running and training were out of the question, as Jacobs, then 24, needed a cane or a walker just to get around. Doctors instructed Jacobs to check in with his godmother, Dorothea Perry, on a daily basis as they continued to monitor his situation. But one night in May 2011, Jacobs left his phone in the car. He decided to wait until morning to retrieve it, not wanting to put additional strain on his ever-weakening lower body to go downstairs. When Jacobs woke up the next day, he couldn’t move his legs at all. Meanwhile, Perry, having not heard from Jacobs, began to worry. She tried calling, but Jacobs didn’t pick up, so after a doctor’s appointment of her own, Perry decided to drive around Park Slope, scouring Jacobs’ neighborhood in search of his apartment building. Perry had been to Jacobs’ apartment only once, at night, and couldn’t remember exactly where he lived, but her instincts eventually led her to the right place. She made her way to Jacobs’ apartment and knocked on the door with no idea what she’d see when it opened. “I heard the knock and I thought, ‘Somebody came to save me,’ ” Jacobs said. “I didn’t know who it was, but I knew no one had heard from me for a very long time. When I realized it was her, I was like, ‘Thank God,’ but she just looked at me and just said, ‘Oh, my God.’ ” Jacobs couldn’t feel his feet and even when he could get upright, it was only a matter of time before he fell back down. He had been scheduled to see a neurologist the next day, but this couldn’t wait. Perry rushed him to the ER. “It’s so hard to describe, to see this young, healthy athlete be reduced to crawling on the floor and not being able to stand on his own feet,” said Perry, who had reconnected with Jacobs after a falling out more than four years earlier. “He looked like he had been crippled all his life. It was incredible, and it was heartbreaking. He’s not my child, but he was my child at that moment. “When he left from my presence, I broke down and I was just crying, one of those really deep cries where you’re like, ‘Where do the tears keep coming from?’ I remember telling my mother, ‘You just don’t understand what I’m looking at. How could this happen to him?’ ” Jacobs said he was calm when he arrived at Brooklyn Hospital, but panic truly started to set in when he couldn’t feel doctors administering an epidural shot. Then the MRIs and other test results came back, and panic turned to fear. Want to follow what's going on in the ring? We've got everything you need with news and analysis, schedules, photos, video, current champions and more from around the boxing world. “As we went through them all, I just kept thinking, ‘It can’t get any worse, it can’t get any worse,’ and then it got worse, and then it got worse again,” Jacobs said. “From everyone’s face, I knew something wasn’t right. I knew the first doctors were wrong, and I knew this was something life-threatening.” The diagnosis was osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer that had manifested itself in the form of a small tumor wrapped around his spine. Had Jacobs let the tumor linger a few more days, doctors said it might have killed him. The quarter-sized lump caused extensive nerve damage and led to the partial paralysis in his legs, and it had to come out. So Jacobs underwent two procedures — one to cut off the blood supply to the tumor and another, on May 18, 2011, to remove it. After the second surgery, Jacobs’ tumor was gone, but the battle was only just beginning. Re-teaching his body Becoming paralyzed was difficult for Jacobs, but it wasn’t the hard part — not compared to the physical and mental struggle of re-teaching his body how to do all the things it once could. The surgery forced Jacobs to wear a large back brace for months, and his pain was worse without the tumor than it was with it. As Jacobs started rehab, he found that immobility had left him a shell of the physical specimen he used to be. All of a sudden, this would-be world champ couldn’t lift an 8-pound dumbbell. “Rehab was harder than some of the boxing camps I’ve had to go through as a professional boxer,” Jacobs said. “I remember being in the hospital two or three days after surgery, when the pain was at its worst, and in my mind, I felt like I just gave up.” That frustration took a toll, not just on Jacobs, but also on his girlfriend, Natalie Stevens. The two had been dating since 2005, and she was one of his primary caretakers during his recovery. As a result, she saw the best and worst of the process as it unfolded in front of her. “I was one of the biggest supporters that he had, so whenever he wanted to snap at me or whenever he wanted to cry, whenever he fell, whenever he was frustrated because he couldn’t use the bathroom alone, couldn’t take a shower alone, I had to take that,” Stevens said. “It definitely was a very bumpy road . . . but we got through it.” After two months in the hospital, Jacobs returned home, and within three weeks, he was back at Starrett City, doing what he could to get into a routine at the gym. Jacobs was hitting the heavy bag before he could stand up and sparring before he could walk, but even as he continued to improve, many doubted he’d ever get back into the ring — the doctors who told him he should give up boxing foremost among them. The staff at Winthrop University Hospital, where Jacobs received radiation treatments, told him he shouldn’t fight again, but he ignored their advice. “Boxing was all I’d known since I was 14 years old, and for someone to say this can’t happen anymore, I couldn’t process it,” Jacobs said. “So that was my motivation to get better, because I wanted to get back in that ring. I missed being there; I missed being in the spotlight. I lived for this, and boxing was what, ultimately, made me happy, so to take my happiness away, I couldn’t live with it.” By January 2012, the pain in Jacobs’ back was gone, and though the nerve damage was only just starting to heal — Jacobs estimates it was about 20 percent of the way along — he could walk normally. It was then that he set a goal to return to the ring in time for the first fight at Barclays Center. There was a time when Jacobs was supposed to headline that evening, but at that point, he would have just been happy just to be on the card at all. Jacobs continued to rehab over the next eight months, and he was there for the arena’s ribbon cutting in September. On Oct. 20, he finally got to fight for real, registering a first-round knockout of Josh Luteran in his first professional bout in nearly two years. “I told him, ‘Remember when you were in the hospital and you asked me, ‘Why me?’ ” Stevens recalled asking Jacobs. “This is exactly why. Now he’s not going to be known as a kid with a great talent who can just knock people out. Now he’s known as the man who fought the biggest fight of his life and is an inspiration for the whole entire universe. This is why that happened to him.” Said Jacobs: “It was one of the greatest moments of my life.” Comeback is for others, too There’s a small tattoo on the left side of Jacobs’ chest, in the shape of a ribbon. Jacobs calls it his badge, and he points to it when he talks about the impact his story has had on others since he overcame cancer. Over the last 18 months, he has come to learn that his comeback is about more than just him. “I feel like I represent so much more than just getting back to boxing,” Jacobs said. “I represent so many different people in this world hurt by this sickness. I know someone who has cancer, you know someone who has cancer or who has been affected by it. When you go to war, you do it to represent your country, and I felt like I was going to war representing so many patients and their families.” Jacobs has gotten support from every direction over the past 18 months — from Facebook friends and Twitter followers, fans, old pals and neighbors. He’s gotten letters from all over the country, and he speaks to kids about his story. “When fellow cancer patients or people who have family with cancer come to me, we talk about it,” Jacobs said, “and that’s when I really feel good.” But Jacobs also has found his battle to be an inspiration to people closer to home — particularly his son, Nathaniel. Nathaniel turns 4 on Monday, and there will be a boxing-themed birthday party at Starrett City to celebrate. Stevens says Nathaniel idolizes his dad, wakes up each morning asking to watch boxing movies on Netflix and prefers doing jumping jacks and pushups to normal “kid stuff.” Nathaniel doesn’t fully understand what his dad has been through, but someday he will, and Jacobs takes pride in the role model he’s become. “I know one day he’ll look back and say, ‘My dad was a champ, and my dad never gave up,’ ” Jacobs said. “All those emotions made that ring walk (at Barclays Center) like cloud nine. I floated to the ring.” Added Stevens: “It’s definitely going to make him proud to know that his father is not only a great person, but an actual warrior — not because he can go and physically hurt a person in the ring, but because he can overcome something like this, remain positive about it and use it as a voice to give hope to other people who are going through it.” Back in the ring Saturday Back at Starrett City, Jacobs is preparing for his next fight, Saturday at Madison Square Garden against Chris Fitzpatrick, on the Miguel Cotto-Austin Trout undercard. Wearing a shirt that looked like a garbage bag and bright pink boxing shoes, Jacobs jumped rope for 20 minutes, working up a good sweat before slipping on a T-shirt and getting into the ring with another trainer, Andre Rozier, as Roundtree watched from the edge of the mat. Rozier and Jacobs sparred for almost 45 minutes, with Jacobs firing jab after powerful jab before taking a quick water break and starting right back up again. Each sparring session ending with series of rapid-fire, rhythm punches that went until someone quit swinging. Jacobs was never the one to say uncle, and that’s how it’s been ever since he made it his goal to fight again. “I’m an eternal optimist, and at one point, I said that if he’s going to give it a shot, we’ll all push and make sure he gets there,” Rozier said. “If we give him positive reinforcement, he should rise to another plateau. Will it be the plateau that he was at before? That has yet to be seen.” Jacobs is 25 now, and he still isn’t close to where he wants to be. He hopes to soon get back to fighting tougher competition, and he hopes a title fight is in his future. But even if Jacobs never gets back to the level he was once at, that he’s in the ring at all still feels like something of a victory. “I’m just looking to perform and get in there and have fun,” Jacobs said. “I’m not trying to go and stress myself out too much; I’m looking to enjoy every day as if it was my last. … (When) I was in that hospital, I remember sitting and looking out the window, just looking at people at the bus stop, and that was the highlight of my day. So it really made me more appreciative of every day that I have.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.",Raw Data
795,"We're not expecting a classic in the weekend's first Premier League game between Fulham and Stoke but goals are expected in Arsenal's clash against Aston Villa at the Emirates Stadium. Everton and Manchester United are both expected to pick up three points as Nick Hext, David John and Ben Coley look at another very interesting day of action in the top-flight. Fulham v Stoke (1245 GMT) This isn't the most enticing of games for the neutral in Saturday's lunchtime offering for the television cameras. This battle between two mid-table clubs gives Stoke the chance to win a Premier League away game for only the second time this season - their only success on the road coming at West Brom on December 1 - and they will be happy to see Fulham's recent record isn't too hot. Martin Jol's men have only won one of their previous six home matches and a six-point gap to the relegation zone isn't enough to sit completely easy. There was only one goal in the Cottagers' previous two contests and it's also interesting to note that three of Stoke's previous six away matches have finished 0-0. That leads me to getting involved with the 9/1 for no goalscorer. Stoke will as always prove tough to break down and I don't think a point from Craven Cottage will be a bad return for the men from the Potteries. Get with the no goalscorer to provide yourself with some interest. Verdict: Fulham 0 Stoke 0 (NH) Premier League An embattled Arsene Wenger has asked his players for a positive response after a bad week that has seen them ousted from the FA Cup and completely on the back foot after the first leg of their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich. The Gunners are 1/3 to get back on track with three points as they pursue fourth place in the Premier League so the question for punters will be how far has the rot set in? Five or six weeks ago you would have expected the hosts to sweep aside Villa but there have been some signs of an encouragement for Paul Lambert with a vital three points secured against West Ham on their last outing which has seen them climb out of the bottom three. They have had some time since to freshen up to heal a few ailments and there have been little nibbles on the visitors at 10s to take advantage of Arsenal's current frailty, but even taking that into account, an away success would still be a shock to my mind. That said, Villa have managed to start scoring with 11 goals in their last six outings in all competitions and will be encouraged to keep that sort of form going against a back line that has looked little short of laughable on occasions. Wenger should get a tonic of sorts but the suggestion is to back both teams to score. Verdict: Arsenal 3 Aston Villa 1 (DJ) Norwich haven't beaten a Premier League side since December 15 and the visit of Everton poses plenty of problems. David Moyes' side stumbled at Oldham last weekend and are now three games without a win and five without a clean sheet, but they're tempting at odds-against given their exploits throughout the season. One obvious policy would be to go low on goals given Norwich's home record, particularly of late with five of their last six matches having produced fewer than three goals. However, Everton's success this season has been built on out-scoring the opposition and relying on them keeping a clean sheet looks a risky policy. Somewhat remarkably, their last six victories in the Premier League have come via a 2-1 scoreline and although we may be latching onto this trend too late, the price that they do so again looks suitably valuable for a small wager. The more cautious could back them to win without keeping a clean sheet or by exactly a goal at a similar price, but we'll keep stakes smaller and play on what's a very strong trend. Verdict: Norwich 1 Everton 2 (BC) There is plenty of interest in this match between the side at the bottom of the Premier League and the side at the top. There is a 48-point gap between the clubs in the standings and that will show if QPR play as badly as they did in the 4-1 defeat at Swansea last time out. That loss followed a couple of 0-0 draws so it's hard to know exactly which Hoops team will turn up and take on the leaders. Harry Redknapp's men have secured goalless draws against Manchester City and Tottenham in two of their last three home league games and you can get 14/1 with Sky Bet about the same result on Saturday. Some may find that of interest but I'm more tempted by the price for Manchester United to win by one goal - as we all know they have done on numerous occasions during the campaign so far. I'm put off enough, however, by the horrendous display from QPR at Swansea to steer clear of that tip with the potential for the Red Devils to win with ease. Looking at United to win to nil should also get a few of you curious. It isn't for me with Sir Alex Ferguson's men conceding a goal in five of their previous seven matches and not looking completely solid throughout the season. Verdict: QPR 1 Manchester United 3 (NH) This is one of quite a few key battles between sides at the wrong end of the table that we can expect between now and the end of the season. Reading and Wigan sit 18th and 19th respectively and a win for either side would do wonders for their survival bid. A draw would not. Reading enter the contest on the back of two 2-1 defeats - one in the league and one in the cup - but they were on an unbeaten run of six games prior to that so confidence remains high. You can get 9.1 with Sky Bet for a 2-1 Wigan win on Saturday but that isn't one for me. I would be backing the Latics if the odds for the away victory were a bit more inviting. Wigan impressed greatly in last weekend's 4-1 FA Cup win at Huddersfield but they are without a Premier League victory in 2013 so calm down and don't get too carried away. Here are some points to consider - but not for us to tip. You can get 5/6 for Reading to score last (they have done so in their previous eight matches) and 13/2 for Adam Le Fondre to score last (he has done so for the Royals in three of those games). Wigan, however, have scored last in eight of their previous nine matches and can be backed to do so again at 11/10. The end result of that is I won't be getting involved. Verdict: Reading 1 Wigan 1 (NH) West Brom are feeling much better about life after winning 2-0 at Liverpool in their previous game. That ended a run of eight matches without a win for the Baggies, which stretched back to Boxing Day, and that had led to some of the good work in the first half of the season being undone. They still sit ninth in the table - a very good effort it's fair to say - and fans at The Hawthorns should look forward to the rest of the campaign with a smile. Sunderland supporters won't be quite so cheery. The Black Cats sit 13th with a six-point gap to the bottom three. That means a few more wins would come in handy and three points on Saturday would certainly be welcomed. I don't think that will happen here but West Brom's run prior to the great night at Anfield is enough to put me off getting involved with the home victory. Verdict: West Brom 2 Sunderland 1 (NH)",Raw Data

797,"In addition to preparing to try to better his 2012 runner-up finish in the NASCAR Sprint Cup standings, Clint Bowyer is getting ready to make his debut in the Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway. Bowyer joins Michael Waltrip Racing co-owners Michael Waltrip and Rob Kauffman and Rui Aguas on the AF Waltrip Racing team for the event. Bowyer, for his part, hasnt found the speed in the cars that he might have hoped in recent runs. During the NASCAR Sprint Media Tour hosted by Charlotte Motor Speedway on Tuesday, Bowyer jokingly asked if he should wear cowboy boots and tuck his fire suit into them before climbing into his Ferrari 458 GT. Overall, though, he deemed the looming race as interesting. He said he joined the team because Kauffman asked him to. Rob does so much for us, its like this: If Rob asks you to do anything, the answer is yes. I dont care what is in front of it or what were doing, I owe it to him to do that. I enjoy Rob, Ive really enjoyed getting to know him, Bowyer said. Hes a racer. That man is dedicated beyond belief to this sport, to us at MWR, and hes fun to be around. Im looking forward to it. Rui, our other driver, is way good. Its been a long time since I showed up to a test and had to work that hard and, honestly, never found the speed he had. He didnt get a real grasp of the rules of exchange, either. Bowyer says that he wants things to be explained and to have a clear plan for moves especially things like being caught from behind by another racer. LOOK AT ME Bowyer already enjoys a strong racing resume. Check out his top racing accomplishments. For that, he says, he wants a specific plan. Unfortunately, he just hasnt gotten one. Im not used to those cars. You see their headlights coming and then I get out of the way, he said. Im off the track. They could be 1,000 yards behind you, but as soon as I see headlights theres no rules of the road. Thats the biggest problem. Just tell me to go to the inside or the outside and Im going to be out of the way when you get there. Theres no rules. They just say kind of hold your line and well . . . figure it out. I dont like figuring things out when a car is 50 miles an hour faster than you. I want to know exactly what is going to happen. I can tell whats going to happen if Im going faster than them, but if they come up on you, I dont know who that guy is and what hes thinking and how tired he is a 5 oclock in the morning. When asked how he would prepare for the lengthy event, he pointed to the logo of sponsor 5-Hour Energy on the backdrop. A lot of it, he said.",Raw Data

The Spaniard acknowledged there were still issues to resolve. But he believes Ferrari is in a far better position than it was at the same point last year and is confident of a good start in the Australian Grand Prix. ""We will be strong in Australia, that is where we need to be,"" said Alonso, who completed 110 laps on Tuesday and ended the day third fastest overall. ""We need to improve on what we did last year because obviously it was not enough, we finished second and we want to finish first. ""To improve on the first part of the year is not going to be too difficult so we are relatively confident. ""I fought for the championship last year with a car that was two seconds off the pace in the winter. ""So we need to be positive and think that we will fight for the championship again this year if we improve the car a little bit."" The Spaniard added that the feel of the new car is similar to that of its predecessor. He put this down to the stability of the rules and is anticipating a series of upgrades that will be introduced between now and Australia that will build on that platform. ""The feeling with the car was OK, all as expected, a continuation of the Brazil car let's say,"" said Alonso. ""This is a good thing, not like last year when we drove for the first time and were a little bit surprised on the bad side. ""We need to be in the group of the leaders and for that we need to do a good job this winter. ""For that, we are trying some parts on the car. We will try more in the last test and more will arrive for Australia, so Friday there will also be important.""",Raw Data
799,"As a point guard, Lawson led the University of Tennessee to three Final Four appearances, Team USA to a gold medal at the Beijing Olympic Games and the Sacramento Monarchs to a WNBA Championship. Off the court, Lawson is a top womens and mens college basketball analyst at ESPN and tireless contributor to important community and charitable organizations. Lawson points the way -- on and off the court. So it was fitting when these two worlds merged with the recent announcement that Lawson and Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning had been named honorary co-chairs of the Pat Summitt Foundation Advisory board, tasked with strategically building and utilizing resources for the fight against Alzheimers disease. After Coach Summitt announced that she had early onset Alzheimers, my husband [Damien Barling] and I decided we wanted to get involved in efforts to find a cure and help families with treatment and support, said the Connecticut Sun guard after her appointment to the board. My husband ran the NYC Marathon and I did the 5K and we raised some funds along the way. I also pledged $50 for every three-pointer I made with the Sun, and fans and other folks made similar pledges, which resulted in more donations. Then, when the Pat Summitt Foundation was founded, I was approached about being of the Board and ,of course, accepted and we rolled all of those funds into the Foundation and it all took off from there. This tends to happen with Lawson. The Alexandria, Virginia native surveys a scene, identifies the best path and leads the way. Whether its leading the Connecticut Sun to the Eastern Conference Finals like she did last season, or stepping up when a worthy charity needs help, it all takes off from her vision. As a result, the Pat Summitt Foundation, and by extension those battling Alzheimers disease, will benefit from Lawsons proactive leadership. The Mission of the Pat Summitt Foundation is to support those afflicted with Alzheimers and their caregivers and families, said Lawson. We need to find a cure. Efforts to find a cure for Alzheimers are not as well funded as other diseases and we need to address that. Having someone like Pat Summitt , who is living an active life, and still fighting, is great for awareness. Pat is such a powerful public figure. Lawson knows first hand how powerful a figure Summitt is, having known the legendary former Tennessee coach on a sporting and personal level for many years. Coach Summitt has been a huge influence on my life, going back to when she recruited me to attend the University of Tennessee, said Lawson, who was heavily recruited out of high school, eventually choosing to go to Knoxville. Even then, Coach Summitt stressed to me that when you commit to Tennessee its not a short-term, four-year decision, its a lifetime decision, you will always be welcome and a part of Tennessee. We need to find a cure. Efforts to find a cure for Alzheimers are not as well funded as other diseases and we need to address that. Having someone like Pat Summitt , who is living an active life, and still fighting, is great for awareness. Pat is such a powerful public figure. -- Kara Lawson This strong bond to Tennessee and Coach Summitt did indeed surpass the traditional four-year commitment to a University for Lawson. Obviously, I dont get to see Coach Summitt as much as when I was a 17-year-old kid playing on campus, but weve always kept in touch by phone and text, and when I get a chance to get down to Knoxville, we get together, said Lawson. We would always touch base, prior to the onset of the disease and now that shes no longer coaching, were able to connect too. This tight relationship with Summitt has also extended far past the confines of the basketball court. Coach Summitt has been very impactful on my life. Any big decisions Ive made in my life, since Ive known Coach Summitt, Ive discussed it with her, said Lawson. I value her advice and her opinion, not limited to sports, but just in life. We talk a lot and thats important to me. One WNBA off-season I rehabbed down in Knoxville and it was great spending evenings with Coach Summitt while I was down there. Lawson, as one can imagine, values the virtue of hard work, simultaneously getting her body and mind sharp for another run at the WNBA Championship with teammate and reigning WNBA Most Valuable Player Tina Charles and new head coach Anne Donovan with the Connecticut Sun, while also handling the high-exposure gig as womens and mens college basketball analyst with ESPN. Being a professional athlete, there really isnt an off-season, as Im always working out and doing everything I can to get better on the court, to improve my game. Its all about quality workouts and building off the previous season and getting better and better, said Lawson, who had her best personal statistical WNBA season ever in 2012. This is also my tenth year at ESPN covering womens and mens college basketball, which is a full-time job in itself, so Im definitely keeping busy. Its kind of like having two full-time careers going at the same time, which is a challenge, but Ive managed to stay disciplined and Im really enjoying both. Due to her extensive knowledge of the college game and her wealth of experience in the WNBA, Lawson has a unique perspective on two of the top womens college players who may be coming into the WNBA for the 2013 season, Baylor senior Brittney Griner and Delaware senior Elena Delle Donne. With Griner and Delle Donne, I think youre looking at the evolution of our game. -- Kara Lawson With Griner and Delle Donne, I think youre looking at the evolution of our game, and its really fun to watch. These are two potentially game-changing prospects, said Lawson. Griner has the most potential of any center Ive ever seen coming into the WNBA. She will change what teams can run against whichever team ends up with her. There is no other player in the world with her potential. On the defensive end, again, teams will have to figure out how to run their offense against Griner. And her offensive game continues to grow. \You can try and front her, but if her teammates can make the right passes over that, its going to be really tough to stop her. According to Lawson, Delle Donne is also a special player. Delle Donne is about 6-5 and is just a superior player on the offensive end. Shes proficient behind the arc and with her ball-handling skills and ability to score, she is a unique player who will force teams to adjust to her game, said Lawson. Whats really exciting about these two players is to see how they will play with and against the next level of player they will be competing with in the WNBA. Right now theyve gotten their games to where they are with top college level players. The chance to see them with great, professional teammates is really intriguing. The future of the Connecticut Sun in 2013 is also intriguing as Donovan was recently named as the new head coach of the franchise. Once again, Lawson is a good source of information regarding Donovan, having played for her while winning an Olympic Gold Medal with Team USA in 2008. I kind of know what to expect from Coach Donovan, and Im looking forward to working with her, said Lawson. We know each other from the Olympics, not just on the court, but off the court ,and I think those relationships can be very valuable. We understand each other, each others strengths and tendencies and style. Anne is honest, disciplined and straightforward. Theres not a lot guessing with Anne. She lets you know what she wants and expects.",Raw Data
800,"Diggins scored 21 points, all in the first half when she was 9-of-9 shooting, to lead the Fighting Irish to an 89-44 victory over Providence on Saturday, becoming the fourth Irish player to ever score 2,000 career points. McGraw was asked where she would place Diggins among Notre Dame's all-time greats. ''Well, right now she's fourth,'' McGraw said, smiling. Diggins, who is averaging 15.5 points a game, has a shot at becoming Notre Dame's all-time leading scorer. Irish assistant coach Beth Morgan holds the mark at 2,322 points, set from 1993-97. ''It will be great if Sky breaks the record. I think Beth will be the biggest cheerleader for her to do that,'' McGraw said. It didn't take Diggins long to get started Saturday. She took a pass from Kayla McBride on the opening tip-off to score an easy layup 4 seconds in, to pass the milestone. Diggins said she wanted to get it over with quickly, and the sellout crowd erupted. ''The roar that came when I made that basket is something I won't forget,'' Diggins said. ''It's special because I'm from here.'' Diggins then quickly got started on moving to her next milestone, hitting from inside, mid-range and behind the 3-point line as Providence (6-13, 1-5 Big East) could do nothing to slow her. The only mistake Diggins made in the first half was to miss a free throw as the Irish (18-1, 7-0) jumped to a 46-15 lead. ''She took over the game,'' McGraw said. Diggins had a 10-0 run on her own, starting with a free throw to give the Irish an 11-4 lead. She then scored on a pair of layups 12 seconds apart, then added another layup and a 3-pointer as Notre Dame opened a 20-4 lead. ''I was just looking for my opportunities and taking what they gave me,'' Diggins said. ''I was getting good passes, too. We were getting steals and we were getting out in transition.'' Tori Rule led the Friars with 12 points, all in the second half. Symone Roberts, Providence's leading scorer at 15.3 points a game, was 1-of-8 shooting for two points. ''I was thrilled with the way we guarded her. I think everybody had a chance to guard her. Sky guarded her for the most part in the first,'' McGraw said. Providence coach Susan Robinson Fruchti said the Irish are just always ready no matter who they face. ''That's what I try to get our players to understand: you have to bring it every day. This league is too difficult not to do that,'' she said. Even with Notre Dame reserves playing much of the second half the Irish continued to pull away. Natalie Achonwa had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Irish and Jewell Loyd added 10. The Irish outshot the Friars 51 percent to 31 percent, scoring 56 points in the paint. Notre Dame also had a 51-26 rebounding advantage. Diggins didn't miss a shot until 5 minutes into the second half, when the Irish led 54-19. The Friars didn't have more points than Diggins until Lexi Sells hit a 3-pointer with 12:00 left to cut Notre Dame's lead to 62-24, and by then Diggins was watching from the bench. Notre Dame's 13-game winning streak is the sixth longest in school history.

802,"December 17, 2012 -- After leading the Indiana Fever to the WNBA Championship in October, Lin Dunn had one last play to run on behalf of the Fever and their rabid Indiana fans heading into the holidays. This play, however, wasnt drawn up in a locker room, but was cooked up in her kitchen, as Dunn made good on a pledge to cook an authentic Southern Fried Meal for Fever fans who won a charity auction benefiting Breast Health Awareness. Dunn and Fran Robinson spent upwards of five hours prepping the dinner in her kitchen before packing it up  Top Chef-style  and heading over to Carmel, Indiana where winning fans Barb Siwy and Lisa Baker were presented with a Southern Extravaganza courtesy of 2012 WNBA Champion/Chef Lin Dunn. Dunn met role model Billie Jean King last week. We went all out, said Dunn, recounting the menu. Fried chicken, fried okra, fried corn, fried cabbage, fried green tomatoes, fried black-eyed pea cornbread, real country ham, pecan pie, you name it, we cooked it. Weve been doing this for a few years now to give back to fans who support important charities and we had ourselves a great night. Since most of the prep work was done in Dunns kitchen, Siwy, Baker and friends could just sit back and enjoy a great meal, all in the name of a worthy charity. We cooked up the fried green tomatoes and fried okra in their kitchen as fresh appetizers, but the rest we just warmed up and served, so we didnt leave any mess in their kitchen, said Dunn. I tell you, if youve never had a nice glass of red wine and fried green tomatoes, you just havent lived. Many Fever fans werent alive -- or cant remember -- the last time an Indianapolis-based professional basketball team won a league championship (Pacers, ABA title in 1973) and Dunn was instrumental in leading Tamika Catchings and the Fever to the WNBA championship over the defending champion Minnesota Lynx in October. Despite crucial injuries to Katie Douglas and Jeanette Pohlen, Indiana was able to reach down the bench and topple the Lynx, thanks in large part to vocal, enthusiastic fan support. Well, home-court advantage started up in Minnesota, where they had terrific fan support and sold out their building, said Dunn. But, when we came back to Indiana, we sold out our place and it was truly a case of having the Sixth Man. The energy of the fans was so important, it drove us, especially late in games, in crunch time. We had some injuries to key players and were low in numbers and needed that energy, and our fans were there to provide it.  If youve never had a nice glass of red wine and fried green tomatoes, you just havent lived. -- Lin Dunn After over 30 years of coaching, Dunn was philosophical about reaching the pinnacle of her profession, and was honored to meet one of her biggest role models growing up in the world of womens sports, when introducing Billie Jean King at a Womens Fund of Central Indiana last week. I grew up in the 50s and 60s playing sports before Title IX, when it was illegal for women or girls to play sports in Alabama, so someone like Billie Jean King is a true role model. I had other role models, of course, like Eleanor Roosevelt and Margaret Thatcher, but that was politics, so to have Billie Jean King in 1973 beat Bobbie Riggs and show the world that women can compete and win, I will never, ever forget that, said Dunn, who has championed the groundbreaking Title IX legislation which celebrated its 40th Anniversary in 2012. It showed me, I can do it, I can fight this discrimination and compete and win. To then meet her, was just so special. She is truly a wonderful woman and to hear her speak and say, its not about he, or she, its about we . . . I tell you, we could use Billie Jean King in Congress, she would help us get over this fiscal cliff. Ever the competitor, Dunn quickly pivoted from the subject of social justice back to the court, where she expressed a keen desire to savor her championship accomplishment and attempt to parlay it from a title into a dynasty. Any time you can be the first to do something, like we did here, its something that can never be taken away from you. We will always be the first WNBA Championship team in Indiana, said Dunn, whose Fever rode the spectacular effort of 12-year veteran Tamika Catchings to knock off the Lynx in the 2012 WNBA Finals. But, any time you win a championship, the big question is: Can you do it again? We got one, can we get two? Can we repeat? I do know one thing, its really, really hard to win a championship. Its TEN TIMES HARDER to win another one.  Difficult though it may be, Dunn will be hungry for the fight come tip-off in 2013.",Raw Data
803,"Bummed out that the 2012 fantasy football campaign is kaput? You’re preaching to the choir. As one who writes about the rotisserie world for a living, you would think the interval between the end of NFL regular season and start of spring training would be a welcomed respite. Not the case, as the sabbatical forces me to engage in dreaded endeavors like conversations with friends, going out on dates, catching up on television shows and other activities that constitute what most call “having a life.” Basically, my nightmare. If you share this sentiment, we have a going-away pigskin present for you. To keep that fantasy thirst satiated until pitchers and catchers report, here is next season’s upper echelon of players, along with performers that fell just short of reaching this stratum: See who the hottest names are as teams hunt for new head coaches. One of the toughest omissions on our list, as Beast Mode submitted his finest season in his six-year career with 1,590 yards on the terrain and 12 total touchdowns. Plus, you can’t put a price on Lynch’s ongoing comedic Skittles-on-the-sideline routine. (Sadly, my attempt to replicate this awesomeness by rewarding our co-ops with Reese's cups after solid projects has been futile.) Unfortunately, Lynch’s off-the-field issues last summer might translate to a four-game suspension to begin 2013, leaving him out of our first round. If the Seattle back is able to avoid Judge Goodell’s gavel, reinsert Lynch into this elite tier. Dez Bryant, Cowboys Don’t laugh. The mix of Bryant’s strong second half (50 receptions, 879 yards, 10 touchdowns) with the unbridled fervor from Cowboys fans could correlate to the maligned wideout going in the early second round next summer. Bryant’s good, but he’s not that good…yet. Chris Johnson, Titans Rarely does a 1,240-yard rusher disappoint his contingent, and perhaps that designation is too caustic in regards to Johnson’s 2012 performance. Alas, it would be erroneous to say his proprietors were satisfied with their selection, as Johnson’s inconsistency turned his starting status into a weekly deliberation. Note that Johnson had five games with 120 rushing yards or more this season. In that same breath, he also managed five outings with 28 yards or less. This feast-or-famine approach is fine for a third-round pick. For a supposed cornerstone of a fantasy franchise? Not so much. Matt Forte, Bears I think we all hold Forte in a paramount view, yet the Bears back has made just 10 visits to the Promised Land in the past two seasons combined. That’s not getting it done, son. Peyton Manning, Broncos Manning delivered everything his owners could have imagined and more this season: 400 completions, over 4,650 yards, 37 touchdowns and just 11 picks (three which came in the Georgia Dome Debacle in Week 2). These figures were good for the sixth-highest output among quarterbacks in standard formats, with that ranking elevating to fourth-best in PPR leagues. So why is the 6’5” field general with a laser-rocket arm on the outside looking in? For one, the man’s medical past does not convey longevity, and Manning will be 37 at the start of next season. Thanks to new remedial methods, players’ permanence continues to be expanded, but the last I checked, Father Time remains undefeated. Additionally, unlike running backs, serviceable signal callers can be attained relatively easily, as five of the top 10 fantasy arms owned an average draft position in the fifth round or later. As a personal investor in Manning in three different leagues this year, I can attest to his Mile-High magnificence. However, his prestige does not associate to a first-round pick in 2013. Rob Gronkowski, Patriots The chasm between Gronkowski and his colleagues (other than Jimmy Graham) is so vast that the argument could be made for this preeminent standing. Nevertheless, despite the delight deriving from yelling “GRONK!” at the top of your lungs when the adolescent behemoth scores for your team, the New England tight end did suffer two serious ailments in a 10-month span, raising an injury flag over the 23-year-old. Doug Martin, Buccaneers The Muscle Hamster, who outscored every running back not named Adrian Peterson, outside of the first round? Blasphemy! Pump the breaks before you scribe that hate mail, muchacho. Martin supported a robust rushing mark of 90.9 yards per game, and his 11 ground trips to pay dirt were tied for third-best in the NFC. Likewise, Martin was one of the more active backs in the receiving arena, hauling in 49 balls for 472 yards and a score. So why the animosity? Martin’s season stats are embellished by a two-week bonanza against the Vikings and Raiders, brandishing over 486 total yards and six end-zone excursions in that span. Withdraw that radiance, and suddenly the rookie’s harvest looks slightly more pedestrian over 14 games (1,068 rushing yards, 272 receiving yards, six touchdowns). And though I’m not the biggest proponent of this theory, I’m also superstitious enough not to discount the dreaded sophomore slump. In the 11-15 range, Martin deserves a gander, but you’re dancing with the devil by selecting the Boise State product any higher. Megatron gathered the headlines, and rightfully so. However, it warrants mentioning that, in PPR leagues, Marshall finished just eight points behind Calvin Johnson thanks to doubling up the Detroit receiver in scores (11 for Marshall, five for Johnson). In fact, Marshall’s 118 grabs for over 1,500 yards, to go along with the aforementioned touchdowns, placed the Bears primary target more than 30 points ahead of his nearest competition in PPR formats, with Dallas’ Bryant ranking third and Cincinnati’s A.J. Green fourth. Though not worthy of a first-round snag, Marshall is undoubtedly the second-best wideout available in next year’s draft. Darren McFadden/ Maurice Jones-Drew FACT: Since entering the league in 2008, Run DMC has spent 29 percent of his team’s games in sweats on the sideline. Not exactly the stability you’re looking for out of an alleged high-end commodity. As for Jones-Drew…anyone else calling shenanigans on the timing of MJD’s ankle surgery? Keep in mind, Jones-Drew was entangled in a lengthy and acrimonious holdout during training camp, so is it that much of a reach to assume he prolonged the procedure in order to miss offseason workouts? And if this claim seems unnecessarily malicious, I didn’t even have Jones-Drew on any team this season. Can only imagine the disgust spewing from this paragraph if I handed the mic to MJD proprietors. Robert Griffin III, Redskins Concededly, by far the most controversial non-inclusion on our list. Don’t believe the figures from Griffin were an aberration this fall; if anything, the former Heisman winner’s passing production should improve with a full year of Pierre Garcon and the return of Fred Davis (and if not Davis, at least a viable tight end whose initials aren’t “Logan Paulsen.” Unfortunately, a majority of Griffin’s worth stems from his aptitude on the soil (815 rushing yards, seven touchdowns). Expect those numbers to significantly decrease, with Mike Shanahan and company pulling the reins on their quarterback’s rush forays in order to preserve his health. I still see the Washington arm as a top-10 player at his position, but there’s too much inherent risk drafting Griffin at this level. However, there is an upshot to Griffin’s cutback in rush attempts… …with Morris the beneficiary to amplified action in the Washington offense. I’m slightly concerned that the heightened workload (335 attempts, third-most in the league) might lend itself to injury next season, yet Morris is young enough that these anxieties should be alleviated. What impressed me most from the rookie rusher was his consistently, as Morris failed to surpass 76 rushing yards just twice this season. You would hope he becomes more involved in the receiving forum (a meager 11 catches in 2012), but hard to complain about 13 touchdowns. No. 11 - Jamaal Charles, Chiefs Denver’s Manning and Minnesota’s Peterson have garnered attention for illustrious rejuvenations from injuries, but how about some love for Charles? This was a guy who entered 2011 as the fourth overall fantasy pick after posting 1,467 rushing yards, 468 receiving yards and eight touchdowns in 2010. Yet, in preliminary pieces looking forward to the 2013 fantasy calendar, Charles is nowhere to be found in spite of amassing 1,500 rushing yards, 236 receiving yards and six touchdowns. Not bad for someone who had to work with Brady Quinn the majority of the year. It appears Andy Reid will be in the Arrowhead saddle for 2013. While Reid’s usage, or lack thereof, of LeSean McCoy will be referenced as reason to avoid Charles (more on this in a moment), I still anticipate the former All-Pro back as the, ahem, “chief” component of Kansas City’s offensive assault. Not the biggest advocate of taking receivers in the first round, and highly unlikely the Detroit wideout replicates his record-setting standard from this season. Still, got to pay homage to Megatron. Only tidbit I have involves the Lions’ search for a serviceable receiving complement, as many accept that Johnson could be capable of more if Motown had someone to shift the adversarial focus. Don’t subscribe to this notion, as Johnson’s targets would take a significant decline and thus leave him with fewer prospects. Fortunately for Johnson managers, the Lions are far from attaining this goal, so Johnson should continue his conquests. No. 9 - LeSean McCoy, Eagles Might seem like a precipitous drop for an entity that some envisioned as the top back of 2012. Frankly, I think this spot is generous, given McCoy’s failure to get into the end zone (a scant two rushing touchdowns this year versus 17 land dives in 2011) and the emergence of backup Bryce Brown. And while we’re here, there’s a universal misnomer that McCoy was misused this season by the Eagles, which states the Philly back was left in the cold. Hold on, sports fans, truth bomb heading in your direction: in 15 games in 2011, McCoy was bestowed 321 touches (273 rushes, 48 receptions) for an average of 21.4 opportunities per outing. In 12 contests this past campaign, the total workload was 254 ventures (200 carries, 54 grabs) equating to…21.2 touches per game. Can’t say that comprises a misappropriation of assets. However, assuming Michael Vick is not under center in the City of Brotherly Love next season and the Philadelphia front line is healthy, McCoy can rectify his 2011 form. Though he’s far from a lights-out pick, McCoy has enormous upside for a player at this juncture of the draft. No. 8 - Cam Newton, Panthers Received quite a bit of derision following Newton’s early-season struggles after writing the following in our annual Draft Guide: “A hearty contingent believes the former Heisman winner’s statistical onslaught was a bit of an aberration and that regression is inevitable, verified by his standing outside the overall top 20 on a multitude of preseason projections. Undoubtedly, replicating 14 rushing touchdowns might be too tall of an order. Then again, if Newton was capable of such carnage with just an abbreviated assimilation period in 2011 thanks to the lockout, imagine the wrath he can inflict with an entire offseason under his belt.” Well guess what, haters? Thanks to a second-half revival, Newton finished as the fourth-highest scorer in standard leagues this season, so swallow that scoreboard justice. If Newton gets any kind of receiving help this offseason, the third-year man could be an unstoppable force. Only apprehension regarding Newton is the vehemence of tales depicting his abrasiveness in the locker room. Usually we disregard most matters of this nature, yet the staggering amount of boorishness in accusations of Newton’s character almost gives you pause in building a team around an asserted tyrant. No. 7 - C.J. Spiller, Bills Considering he split substantial time with Fred Jackson, Spiller finishing as the seventh-highest scorer at this position in standard leagues (sixth-best in PPR formats) is nothing short of astonishing. Projected as the primary back in Buffalo next season, Spiller has the duo dexterity of a Marshall Faulk and wouldn’t surprise me if he finished 2013 as the top back in professional pigskin. Even if Jackson returns to the Bills, Spiller is no worse than an early second-round selection. No. 6 – Drew Brees, Saints Twenty turnovers were disconcerting, but despite these miscues, Brees finished as the top-rated fantasy arm in 2012 thanks to 43 touchdowns and over 5,175 yards. The return of Sean Payton, along with an improved defense, should ease up on the flight attempts from New Orleans, which should help Brees maintain his strength and stability throughout the season. As close to a “sure-thing” as one can obtain in a fantasy draft, even more so than… Aside from playing outdoors, Brady has every advantage over Brees: better receivers, two superior tight ends, sound running game and strong defense that doesn’t put the New England offense in compromising positions. In short, Brady just has a higher ceiling than Brees. So why is Brees considered more of a can’t-miss selection than Brady? Three words: Bernard Karmell Pollard. (That sound you just heard was every Pats backer muttering an obscenity.) No. 4 - Ray Rice, Ravens Selecting Rice is like going to Subway for lunch. No one is ever excited to be heading there, can’t say you’re blown away by its presentation and you certainly won’t be bragging about getting it later on. Yet it always leaves you satisfied, and you certainly could have made a worse choice in this pursuit. And yes, this made a lot more sense when I was eating Subway last week. No. 3 - Arian Foster, Texans Foster possessors voiced their concern that Foster hit a wall in the second half, a claim that was unsubstantiated. Granted, Foster had five rushing touchdowns in the last two months versus 10 in the first eight weeks. However, when subtracting his Week 16 aberration (just 15 yards due to an irregular heartbeat scare), the Houston back averaged 91 rushing yards per game in the second half, comparable to his 96.3 yards mark in Weeks 1-8. The mileage on Foster is quickly escalating (956 carries, 159 receptions), but still think Foster has one more season before the wheels start coming off. No. 2 - Aaron Rodgers, Packers No running game. Primary targets Greg Jennings and Jordy Nelson spent significant time on the sidelines. Jermichael Finley continued to underperform while trying to undermine the Green Bay quarterback’s standing in the locker room. A shuffled and susceptible offensive line. And all Rodgers did was toss for nearly 4,300 yards and 39 aerial scores. What else is there to say? Cat can ball. No. 1 - Adrian Peterson, Vikings I’d try to warn over possible stamina vulnerability, but such counsel has the same chance as a defender in the open field against Peterson.

805,"Adkins was relieved of his managerial duties nine days ago after taking the club to back-to-back promotions and 15th place in the Premier League, with his dismissal arriving two days after a 2-2 draw at Chelsea. He was immediately replaced by Argentinean Mauricio Pochettino, with the general consensus being that Adkins had been harshly treated. The Southampton fans certainly felt so and sang their former manager's name during the 0-0 draw with Everton last Monday, but Cortese stands by the move he made. In an interview with Sky Sports News, he said: ""Nigel and I, we always had a very good relationship, to the last second. It was very tough, not just for him but for me. ""To me, there's one time, which is right, especially if you are 100% convinced it is the right thing. Ultimately for the team it was the right thing, it was perfect timing ""It sounds harsh but it was for the benefit of the progress we want to achieve over the next couple of months and years. It's not only for today but for tomorrow."" Cortese has attracted criticism in the wake of the sacking, with Saints icon Matt Le Tissier accusing him of having an ego problem. According to Cortese, though, everything he does is for the benefit of Southampton. He added: ""Maybe I need to sacrifice my popularity to get the right decision. If that's the case, I'm happy. ""I am a perfectionist. Some people say that's not good, but it helps the football club to keep attention to detail and not stand still."" On Le Tissier, a one-club man afforded hero status by the Saints fans, he said: ""I don't even know him, he's never met me. Anyone in the past who is associated with the club is stirring negativity towards me should probably ask if it's beneficial for the club. I would not allow myself to judge someone I have never met."" On the future of the club, but as a whole and with Le Tissier, Cortese asked everyone to get behind his vision. He said: ""I'd like in the future, for the supporters to buy more into what we do as a club. Not players, managers or chairmen, the club. ""I am not excluding anyone. Anyone who has Southampton at heart has a place.""",Raw Data
806,"A.J. Perez previously worked at USA Today, AOL and CBSSports.com covering beats ranging from performance-enhancing drugs to the NHL. AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. Ashley Repp didn’t hesitate as she and her fiance handed over $2,200 to a scalper wearing a No. 10 Eli Manning New York Giants jersey. “He seemed like a nice guy,” Repp told FOXSports.com. “There wasn’t anything weird about him or anything. He wasn’t sketchy, dirty or unsettling in any way.” For all the cash the young couple had on them, they were handed two tickets to Super Bowl XLVI — or at least what they thought were tickets to last year’s title game in Indianapolis. Both tickets turned out to be counterfeit, something Repp and Brandon Landuyt realized when they were turned away from Lucas Oil Stadium a couple of hours before kickoff. Repp and Landuyt filed one of the 27 reports of counterfeit Super Bowl tickets with Indianapolis police, according to department spokesman Michael Hewitt. (A federal law-enforcement official told FOXSports.com that about 200 people were turned away with counterfeit tickets last year.) Despite recent outreach efforts — including teams such as the San Francisco 49ers sending out warnings to fans — the NFL expects bogus tickets could be just as big an issue this year in New Orleans. “The number of counterfeit and stolen tickets increases every year, with a couple of exceptions,” Anastasia Danias, NFL vice president of legal affairs, told FOXSports.com. Danias said the trend over the last few years has been one major supplier of counterfeit tickets — something that was of major concern in New Orleans the last time the city hosted in 2002 — distributing to individuals or small groups creating the fake tickets. “Consumers have high-quality printers and other technologies that are accessible to them,” Danias said. The fake that Elizabeth Bittner of Scottsdale, Ariz., purchased last year looked real enough. The NFL has multiple authentication measures built into the tickets, including bar codes, a security label (holographic image), heat-activated ink and embedded electronic security; there are no print-at-home tickets for the Super Bowl. “It had a hologram and the raised typeface,” Bittner said. “The only thing that wasn’t right was the face value. It said $600.” The cheapest face-value seat for last year’s Super Bowl was $800, something Bittner said she didn’t know at the time. The transaction happened so fast, Bittner said, there wasn’t much time to second-guess her $900 purchase of the fake ticket. “I had a bad feeling, but when I looked up he was gone,” said Bittner, who this season completed her goal to watch games at all 31 NFL stadiums. “When I made the report at the police substation, there were two kids about college-aged who described the same guy.” The police report obtained by FOXSports.com described the person who sold Bittner the ticket as somebody in a “dirty brown sweater, dark pants and . . . (a) gold front tooth.” Undercover officers were alerted to the description of the seller, but it doesn’t appear he was apprehended. Bittner was so upset, she didn’t even want to watch the game in a sports bar. She did, however, attempt to find the criminal, a search that proved fruitless. “I was going to make a citizen’s arrest,” Bittner said. “I probably would just have called some guys over to help me out.” The NFL has coordinated with local authorities to avoid such situations. New Orleans police will have both uniformed and undercover officers patrolling around the Superdome specifically looking for fake and stolen tickets. Agents from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and NFL employees — equipped with scanners to determine the validity of tickets — will be alongside to assist. On top of counterfeit tickets, stolen tickets also have been an issue in years past. A ticket reported stolen is deactivated and re-issued, making the original ticket worthless. “These people are going to be all over the place selling tickets,” said Sgt. Mike Sposito of the New Orleans Police Department. “This is a worldwide event that brings in the worst element. Some people may be legitimately selling tickets, but there are also those who (make selling fake tickets) their livelihood.” Law-enforcement and NFL officials told FOXSports.com that some of the same scammers show up outside Super Bowl venues every year. “They know the game,” Sposito said. “They know what to look for. They are on the lookout for officers in plain clothes. It’s like they have a sixth sense about who is a legitimate customer or if the buyer is a police officer.” Selling a ticket for over face value is illegal in Louisiana, unless the transaction takes place online. Tickets can’t be sold for even face value within 750 feet of the Superdome. The NFL’s Danias said the league prefers such type of strict scalping laws. Scalping has been legal at prior Super Bowl venues — such as the site of 2008’s Super Bowl XLII, Scottsdale, Ariz. — and booths actually were set up for fans looking to verify a ticket’s validity. Raymond Parmer Jr., special agent in charge of the ICE Office of Homeland Security Investigations in New Orleans, said that his agency won’t be limited to pursuing dubious sellers just within New Orleans. “Rest assured whether people are selling counterfeit tickets on the street or online, we will find them,” Parmer told FOXSports.com. “The people doing the selling online are sophisticated, but [we] have agents all over the country to go after these folks. They will be punished the fullest extent of the law.” The only secondary market vendor authorized by the NFL to sell Super Bowl tickets is its partner, Ticketmaster’s Ticket Exchange. As of Saturday evening, the cheapest seat was $1,900 each. A steep price, but that’s exactly what Repp wound up paying (per ticket) to get into last year’s Super Bowl after she fetched her debit card from her car. She took the NFL up on its offer to buy two face-value seats to the game at $800 each, something the league does on a limited basis for counterfeit ticket victims. Her total out-of-pocket cost, totaling the two fakes ($2,200) and the two genuine articles ($1,600) was $3,800, or $1,900 per. “It was basically our tax-return money,” Repp said. “You don’t really think about it until it happens to you. I just took it as a learning experience.”",Raw Data
807,"Jon Paul Morosi is a national MLB writer for FOXSports.com. He previously covered baseball for the Detroit Free Press and Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He began his journalism career at the Bay City Times in his native Michigan. Follow him on Twitter. Colin Kaepernick is, at the moment, one of the most talked about figures in American sports. In the year of the dual-threat quarterback, he is the last of them standing in the NFL playoffs. He completed three passes during the entire 2011 season but has led the San Francisco 49ers to within one victory of their first Super Bowl berth in nearly two decades. Yes, it’s right there in the fine print of Kaepernick’s ever-expanding bio: The Cubs selected him in the 43rd round of the 2009 draft, only 1,309 picks after the other famous right-hander of that year’s class — Stephen Strasburg. The Cubs were taking a flier, and they knew it: Sam Hughes, a national crosschecker in the team’s amateur scouting department, had watched Kaepernick play quarterback at the University of Nevada. But he also heard during a family visit to Reno that Kaepernick had hit 90 miles per hour off the mound as a high school pitcher in California. Hughes wasn’t worried about the fact that Kaepernick hadn’t played baseball at Nevada. He was an outstanding athlete. And it was obvious that he could throw. In baseball, that’s the rough description of many 43rd-round draft picks. “I ended up watching him play a couple times in football and really liked his athleticism,” Hughes, himself a former quarterback at Louisiana Tech, recalled Sunday in a telephone interview. “But he had a real long arm stroke that’s not very Dan Marino-esque. When he was a sophomore in college, I didn’t know how his game would translate in the NFL. “Our NFL sources at the time thought he was going to be a later-round or CFL guy.” Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates. Apparently, those NFL sources were wrong. Kaepernick politely but firmly told Hughes he wasn’t interested in pursuing baseball, stayed at Nevada for two more seasons (including an otherworldly senior year) and became the Niners’ second-round pick in 2011. A backup to Alex Smith when the 2012 season began, Kaepernick’s star exploded in mid-November. Now he’s everywhere, after leading San Francisco to Saturday’s 45-31 win over Green Bay. During one of his many postgame interviews, Kaepernick wore a Brewers cap. (He was born in Milwaukee.) Hughes couldn’t resist sending him a text. “Let’s not forget you were drafted by the Cubs,” Hughes kidded him. “I want to see you rocking the Cubbie Blue . . . And by the way, pretty good game.” Kaepernick’s reply: LOL. Thank you. Nearly four years after Hughes recommended Kaepernick as a baseball prospect, he remains impressed by his personal qualities. The two never met in person, and yet Kaepernick took a moment to respond to Hughes’ text following the greatest triumph of his professional life. The Cubs were prepared to offer Kaepernick a signing bonus near $50,000 for what amounted to a summer job: He would have reported to the team’s complex in Mesa, Ariz., and thrown off mounds in the heat in June and July before returning to Nevada for two-a-days in August. (NCAA rules permit athletes to turn pro in one sport while preserving their amateur status in another.) Kaepernick wasn’t interested. At all. He told Hughes that he planned to spend the summer in Reno, working with his wide receivers. And the decision was final. “I would have flown all the way to Reno to watch him throw a bullpen,” said Hughes, who is based in Atlanta. “All I was waiting on was a thumbs-up from him or his father, Rick. Between the two of them, I probably made seven or eight phone calls in a two-week period. I was persistent. They kept rejecting me. “I was baffled that they had no interest. He could have played us, like, ‘Oh, let me find out if they’ll give me $50,000 or $100,000. That would be good spending money for the next year in college.’ He could have played that angle. But he showed a lot of maturity and focus. He was all about what he was trying to do on the football field. “That says a lot about the guy. I would have loved to see him throw a baseball. But this is fun watching him throw the football around. He’s an easy guy to root for.” Had the Seattle Seahawks completed their comeback against Atlanta in Sunday’s divisional matchup, the NFC championship game would have pitted Kaepernick against another dual-threat quarterback with a baseball past: Seattle’s Russell Wilson spent two seasons as a second baseman in the Colorado Rockies farm system, batting .229 for affiliates in Pasco, Wash., and Asheville, N.C., before a standout 2011 season at Wisconsin propelled him to the NFL. (Since you’re curious: If Robert Griffin III had a baseball future, Hughes figures it would be on the mound. “Hitting is so hard,” Hughes said. “If I was going to take a random shot and draft RG3, I’d do it as a pitcher.”) In fact, the Hughes family has a history with scouting eventual football stars. Gary Hughes — Sam’s father and one of the industry’s most respected scouts — selected outfielder John Elway for the Yankees and pitcher John Lynch for the Marlins, both from Stanford. (Gary has quipped that his Hall of Fame draft picks end up in Canton, not Cooperstown.) After watching Kaepernick’s heroics over the past two months, Sam Hughes figures that any chance of him coming back to baseball is now gone for good. Except, of course, there’s this tradition at Wrigley Field . . . during the seventh-inning stretch . . . maybe he’d want to visit Chicago on a pristine summer night . . . he could stand on the mound for the ceremonial first pitch . . . and maybe Hughes would pull out his radar gun … “You’ve got to,” he said, laughing over the phone. “You never know how many chances you’ll get. You’ve got to bear down and make the judgment immediately.""",Raw Data

And United legend Charlton, now an Old Trafford director, makes no secret of the fact that he would love to see Ronaldo, 28, back at his club. Sir Bobby said: ""I love Cristiano. I was really, really sorry when he left us but we couldnt stop him leaving."" ""Playing for Real Madrid was something he had to do in his football life."" ""But I always wonder what sort of treatment he is getting at Madrid and whether he can match what happened at Old Trafford and the affection that was shown to him. "" ""They loved him at Old Trafford and still do. People are asking me, Is there any chance, if Real Madrid fall out with him, that maybe we could bring him back? I always say, well, well have to wait and see. He is a great footballer  and we will enjoy playing against him. "" Ronaldo has been even more prolific at Real than he was at United and the fact that he is now set to face the club where he became a global superstar adds further spice to what is an exciting two-legged tie. Charlton says of the battle between two of the most famous clubs in the world: ""When the draw was made it sent a shiver down my spine. My first introduction to European football really was watching Real Madrid  with the likes of Alfredo Di Stefano and Francisco Gento. We learned so much. Madrid gave us so much, really. We have always had an affection for each other. If I have to do something to do with Real Madrid, then I would do it. Can I think of a bigger club match in football than Real Madrid v Man United? The answer is no  unless you maybe involve Barcelona. They have a sense of adventure about them. Real and ourselves are the two biggest-supported clubs in world football. Its fantastic, it will be a great contest. I think it could come down to who is lucky at the time with injuries and suspensions."" But Real have always had the right approach to the game. They are determined to have the best players  no matter how much they cost. They seem to have everybodys affection. That probably comes from them winning the first five European Cups  that was frightening. But we learned how to handle them and we werent totally beaten by them. We had our moments and maybe we will have more moments in the next two matches against them, starting in Madrid on Wednesday. Charlton is happy to talk in glowing terms about Real Madrid  but has ­always been reluctant to discuss their manager Jose Mourinho (left) in similar terms. Mourinho has been touted as a potential successor to United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Perhaps that is why Charlton claims Mourinho sometimes tries to sell himself. But Sir Bobby, recognised as Englands most famous footballer, said: ""Alex respects people in the game if they have made a contribution and rightly so  and Mourinho has. Theres no way I can put the record straight on Mourinho because I dont really know him that well. I will leave all that to Alex. What I know is that Alex is the greatest manager that there has ever been. Who am I to say what Mourinho is going to do? I dont know  I suppose it takes all sorts. "" What Charlton is confident about is that Mourinhos Madrid and Fergies United are about to produce a Champions League classic.

They got everyone involved offensively. They shared the ball. Most of all, they put an end to their four-game losing streak, and at the perfect time. Their 96-83 win over the Portland Trail Blazers at Staples Center avenged a heartbreak loss to the same Blazers team Saturday and served as a prelude to their upcoming eight-game Grammy trip. ""We needed any win right now,"" Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro said. ""We’re just trying to accumulate as many wins as we can and then count them up at the end of the year and see where we’re at."" Where the Clippers are right now is 33-13, third in the NBA’s Western Conference, 2½ games behind the San Antonio Spurs. No one is putting too much importance on their position in January, but they certainly don’t want to slow the momentum any more than they have in recent days. Since the end of their 17-game winning streak, the Clippers are just 8-7. But there was a lot of positive energy flowing from Sunday’s win, especially since the night before they wasted a nine-point lead in the last 2 minutes, 38 seconds to suffer a 101-100 loss. This game was different. Blake Griffin scored 23 points and handed out nine assists after totaling 10 assists on Saturday. Odom came off the bench to finish with eight points, 13 rebounds and six assists. The Clippers shot 51 percent and had 42 baskets on 33 assists. The difference between losing and winning, Odom said later, was ""controlling our emotions, keeping our energy positive and doing all the little things. One of them is playing defense, and whenever we get at it defensively and share the ball, that’s kind of our happy place."" You could see it on the court, where the Clippers moved quickly, distributed the ball and made defensive stops. You could see it on the bench too, where players were leaping off their seats after every alley-oop pass and subsequent dunk. ""When we play with spirit, everybody gets involved somewhere,"" said Jamal Crawford, who had nine points and five assists. ""To have 33 assists and have everybody involved like that and standing up like that when something good happens, that’s who we are. That’s the way we were at the beginning of the season, and we’re getting back to it now."" With guard Chris Paul still out with a bruised right kneecap — and no timetable for his return — the Clippers are trying to make up for his loss as a collective unit. Paul has missed seven of the past nine games, but the Clippers are 4-3 in those games — not great, but not bad either. ""Chris is a huge part of our team,"" Griffin said. ""He directs the game from the point guard spot. He has the ball in his hands 85 percent of our offense. When he goes out, our whole dynamic changes. Other guys have stepped up. Jamal has done a great job, Eric Bledsoe has done a great job. It’s everybody’s job on this team to step up, and that’s what I’ve tried to do."" Griffin tied his career high with 10 assists on Saturday and could have surpassed that total Sunday, except the Clippers had a 16-point lead after three quarters. He tried to convince Del Negro to let him return in the fourth quarter, but that idea was nixed. ""Our lead assist guy is not around, so we have to run some things through Blake at the elbow and let him make plays for us,"" Del Negro said. ""He draws so much attention, but he’s unselfish and he’s making good basketball plays and making us play better. That’s what all-stars do in this league."" They also help their teams win. Griffin did that, and that’s why the Clippers are back in a happy place.",Raw Data
811,"Bologna and Roma shared six goals between them at the Stadio Dall'Ara, living up to the pre-match expectations in an entertaining draw. It was not a game that either home coach Stefano Pioli or his Roma counterpart Zdenek Zeman will have taken particular pleasure in watching given the defensive shortcomings, but the fans certainly got their money's worth from a contest with numerous twists and turns. Alessandro Florenzi gave Roma the lead in the ninth minute, but Alberto Gilardino levelled in the 17th minute. Daniel Osvaldo put Roma back in front within a minute only for Manolo Gabbiadini to re-establish parity before the break. Cristian Pasquato put Bologna ahead for the first time in the game in the 54th minute but Panagiotis Tachtsidis scored the final goal in the 74th minute before Bologna hit the woodwork twice. Frederik Sorensen missed a good early chance for Bologna, and it was a prelude for what was to come. Roma took the lead with their first attack in the ninth minute when Francesco Totti set up Florenzi, who managed to thread the ball past a defender and Federico Agliardi into the far corner. Bologna responded in the 17th minute when Gabbiadini's shot was parried by Goicoechea and Gilardino followed up to poke the loose ball in. The home side barely had time to celebrate when they found themselves behind once again. Miralem Pjanic's cross picked out the unmarked Osvaldo, who headed Roma back in front from close range. Bologna levelled again in the 26th minute, with Gabbiadini cutting in from the right and threading his shot through the legs of Nicolas Burdisso and inside Goicoechea's near post. LOOK WHO'S BACK! Check out the latest moves in Serie A at Transfer Central. Gilardino volleyed into the side-netting as chances continued to arrive at both ends of the field, with Michael Bradley flashing a volley across goal and wide of the far post. It was a familiar story to the second half with Bologna regaining the upper hand just 10 minutes in through Pasquato, who scored his first goal in Serie A after Goicoechea and Burdisso both got in each other's way again. Five goals were not enough, though, and the next one went Roma's way with Tachtsidis finding room for a free-header to bring the Giallorossi back on terms. There was even more drama with Agliardi making an instinctive save to prevent Osvaldo from giving Roma the lead in the 83rd minute. Despite Roma's late pressure, Bologna went closest to snatching a winner with Diamanti hitting the woodwork twice. In the 87th minute his shot cannoned back off the inside of the far post, while deep into stoppage time he sent a direct free-kick on to the crossbar.",Raw Data
812,"Basketball legend Julius ""Dr. J"" Erving was facing legal action Saturday for allegedly cheating a wealthy Manhattan woman out of more than $420,000 in a deal with crooked money manager Kenneth Starr. Mary Gilbert's suit -- which charges Erving with breach of contract and fiduciary duty -- seeks payment of all her lost profits, along with ""prejudgment interest"" and punitive damages. Gilbert, 71, said she met the Hall of Fame star in 1990 through Starr, who hooked her while amassing a roster of clients that included film stars Uma Thurman, Sylvester Stallone and director Martin Scorsese. Gilbert claims Erving, 60, and Starr convinced her to invest in a ""lucrative"" limited partnership called Commonwealth Investors, in which the formerly high-flying forward was a partner. Are they worthy? The fans got most of their All-Star picks right. But they missed a few. They also told her ""that Erving was facing a capital call from the partnership and that if Gilbert would finance a portion of this capital call, Erving would assign to her a percentage of his interest in the partnership,"" her Manhattan federal court filing said. In exchange for nearly $257,000 in cash, Erving allegedly promised Gilbert 33 percent of all his Commonwealth distributions until she was paid back and 30 percent of his returns after that. The deal turned out to be another slam dunk for Erving, who raked in more than $2.9 million from Commonwealth between 1995 and 2010, court papers said. But Gilbert claimed Erving, who starred with the New York Nets and Philadelphia 76ers in the 1970s and 1980s, and Starr ""concealed the true amount of distributions that Erving received ... and falsely reported to Gilbert the share of partnership distributions to which she was entitled."" In addition, ""Erving, with the assistance of Starr, converted a share of the partnership distributions that should have been paid over to Gilbert,"" her suit alleged. Court papers said Gilbert uncovered the alleged scam after hiring experts to review her finances following Starr's arrest last year. He is currently awaiting sentencing March 2 for running a $50 million Ponzi scheme. Erving's lawyer Dorna Taylor declined to comment.",Raw Data

814,"The term “leverage” refers to the principle of using a small advantage (or in negotiating terms, even merely a perceived advantage) to gain a much larger benefit. In Joe Flacco’s upcoming contract negotiations with the Baltimore Ravens, he has more than a “small” advantage. An impressive playoff run and a high-caliber Super Bowl performance has given Flacco more leverage than arguably any other player in the NFL this offseason. So what should the Ravens do with Joe Flacco? Well, here are their options: Sign him to a long-term contract Franchise tag him with an “exclusive” tag Franchise tag him with a “non-exclusive” tag Okay— neither number 4 or 5 is an option so go ahead and throw them out. Realistically, the Ravens will either sign him to a long-term deal or tag him. But which option is the wisest for the Ravens? The popular answer seems to be the long-term contract with a reluctant, “he deserves it.” The proponents of the Ravens giving Flacco a long-term deal consistently cite Flacco’s win-loss record, Super Bowl victory, and his impressive playoff run. It astonishes me how often commentators, analysts, and writers refer to win-loss records as a quarterback’s record. During his contract negotiations with the Lions, I guarantee you never heard the Lions say, “Barry Sanders was 5-11 as a starter with the Lions last year, so we don’t think he’s worth that much.” I understand the quarterback position is the most valuable position on an NFL team, especially in today’s pass-happy league. But to attribute 100% of the credit to the quarterback is absurd. If you asked anyone citing Flacco’s win-loss record as a reason why he should receive a long-term deal if they believed he was 100% responsible for winning or losing every game, they’d all tell you no. Yet they’ll still cite it in a matter-of-fact tone as strong evidence as to why the Ravens should give him the contract? Watch all of the Ravens’ playoff games again (I have with the NFL’s Game Rewind, which is a great deal by the way) and you’ll see how much happened out of Joe’s control that contributed his performance. Obviously this applies to every quarterback, but I’d say it happens for Joe Flacco more so than most quarterbacks. Flacco is the beneficiary of a lot of “high-point” grabs by the big receivers he has in Torrey Smith and Anquan Boldin. He also benefits from great playmakers in the open field, such as Jacoby Jones and Ray Rice. For instance, in week 12 the Ravens were down 10 to 13 to the Chargers, and on 4th and 29 with 1:50 left in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco dumped the ball off to Ray Rice, and Ray did the rest. Hey diddle diddle, Ray Rice up the middle… One isolated instance is nowhere near enough proof to make the statement that “Flacco gets more help than most,” but I can’t prove that statement without forcing you to watch all of Flacco’s game film. What I can provide you with is applicable stats. Here’s Joe Flacco’s career stats: Year Comp. % Yards TD INT Flacco’s agent says Flacco deserves “to be the highest-paid quarterback in the game[.]” And why wouldn’t he? His guy just won the Super Bowl. But the “highest-paid quarterback” in the game is a fleeting title. As the quarterback position has increasingly gained value, there has been a revolving door of blockbuster deals. Currently, Drew Brees holds the title with a 5 year, $100 million contract. So let’s say the Ravens make Flacco the highest-paid quarterback in the league with a 5 year, $101 million contract. What does that mean? Well, if it’s structured like Drew Brees’ contract, it’d look something like this: Year Salary Bonus Cap Hit Brees was 33 when he signed his deal, while Flacco is only 28, so Flacco’s agent may argue that he deserves more guaranteed because he’s younger. Either way, in this scenario Flacco would have the Ravens on the hook for a lot of money. If they backload the deal, the contract could contain clauses relieving them of contractual obligations if they released him prior to a certain date. The Ravens’ alternative to committing themselves to a long-term deal such as this one is the franchise tag. The non-exclusive tag would cost the Ravens $14.6M, while the exclusive tag would cost the Ravens between $20M and $21M. The non-exclusive tag would give other teams the ability to negotiate a contract with Flacco. If another team made an offer, the Ravens would have to match the offer to keep him. Additionally, if the Ravens choose not to match the offer, the team that signed Flacco would have to give Baltimore two 1st round picks as compensation. Yet the Ravens would need to match because there will be no one better than Flacco in free agency or the draft. If they choose to tag Flacco with the exclusive tag, they will take a $20M+ salary cap hit in 2013. A hit they may not be able to afford. So here we stand—a long term deal, an exclusive franchise tag, or a non-exclusive franchise tag—a true predicament. If I was the General Manager of the Baltimore Ravens, here’s the choice I’d make: I’d gamble on the fact that I don’t believe any team would be willing to pay more than a $21M a year and give up two 1st round picks for a quarterback that hasn’t ranked in the top 10 in total QBR in his career. I say $21M and not $14.6M because if a team offers more than $14.6M, I can still match their offer and keep Joe. The only way it becomes a bad decision is if they offer more than the exclusive tag would have cost me ($20M-$21M). In my mind, here’s the two realistic scenarios: Worst Case Scenario: A team makes an offer surpassing the $14.6M tag. In response, we would match the offer and negotiate the long-term deal. (The NFL CBA allows a team to negotiate and come to terms with their non-exclusive tagged player until the Tuesday following the 10th week of the NFL season.) Best Case Scenario: No team is willing to match the $14.6M tag and give up two 1st round picks, so we have Joe Flacco under a 1 year contract for $14.6M. While the cap hit would be $4M more than the cap hit taken in the hypothetical long-term contract, it’s a good trade off for two reasons: (1) it delays the team from having to make a giant financial commitment to Flacco, and (2) it gives Flacco a season where he could possibly, and most likely would, lose a lot of the leverage he had going into the 2013 season. Joe Flacco will likely play the 2013 NFL season without the likes of Ed Reed, Anquan Boldin, and others (including future Hall of Famer Ray Lewis). If he has a phenomenal year individually, something he has never done, then he deserves the giant long-term deal. But, more than likely, he will lose some of the leverage he currently has over the next year, which would make the negotiation table much more palatable to the Ravens. … unless they win another Super Bowl. In which case, you just pay up. In no way am I saying Joe Flacco is a bad quarterback. Joe Flacco is a very good quarterback, but he’s not a top 5 quarterback. Football is a business, and I’m trying to look at it from a business perspective. The less money you have to tie up in your quarterback, the more money you have to spend on other positions. I had a really tough time deciding between tags here. My eventual decision to choose the non-exclusive tag came down to the limited cap space the Ravens already have for this year. If they commit $20M+ to Joe Flacco, they’ll have to make some major moves, whether that’s restructuring contracts or cutting players. Salary information was provided by spotrac.com.",Raw Data
815,"Cristiano Ronaldo hit a hat trick as Real Madrid warmed up for its Copa del Rey clash with Barcelona by rolling to a 4-0 home victory over Getafe in the Spanish league on Sunday. Sergio Ramos scored in the 53rd minute after Ricardo Carvalho forced goalkeeper Miguel Moya to fumble the ball by hitting his arms in an apparent foul that went unpunished. ''I don't know if I fouled him or not,'' Carvalho said. ''It all happened so fast. I jumped and I don't know if I touched him.'' Ronaldo then scored three times in an 11-minute span to give him 21 goals in league play this season, second only to Barcelona's Lionel Messi with 29. Madrid's win kept it in third place and provisionally reduced the gap with Barcelona to 12 points before the league leaders hosted Osasuna later Sunday. Madrid hosts Barcelona in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal on Wednesday. Even though its league title defense looks almost impossible, Carvalho said Madrid was still going all out for victory. ''The most important thing is to win games, in the league as well, since it makes us stronger for the Copa del Rey and Champions League,'' Carvalho said. Madrid hosts Manchester United in the Champions League knockout stage on Feb. 13. Adan Garrido started in Madrid's goal after Iker Casillas broke his hand on Wednesday and underwent an operation on Friday. He will be out for eight to 12 weeks. Madrid signed goalkeeper Diego Lopez from Sevilla on Saturday, and he was on the bench for the game versus Getafe. With the ''clasico'' looming, Madrid coach Jose Mourinho held back Xabi Alonso and only played Sami Khedira and Mesut Oezil 45 minutes each. Madrid had the better share of the scoring chances in a subdued first half. Ronaldo tested Moya with a bouncing free kick 10 minutes in, before drawing a save from the Getafe `keeper in the 22nd. Moya again responded well to turn away back-to-back attempts by Khedira and Fabio Coentrao moments before Madrid finally scored after Carvalho's collision with Moya. ''It was clearly a foul,'' Getafe coach Luis Garcia said. ''It's a pity. When you are losing you have to push forward, and that's what let them get out on the break. Madrid is the best team in the world on the counterattack.'' Ahead 1-0, Madrid didn't look back. Ronaldo finished off a counterattack from its own area in the 62nd, running onto Oezil's pass and firing the ball beyond Moya and inside the far upright. Three minutes later, Ronaldo made it 3-0 as he charged in unmarked behind Gonzalo Higuain to head home Angel Di Maria's floated cross at the far post. Ronaldo dispatched a penalty kick into the lower left corner in the 72nd to record his second hat trick in league play this season after Alberto Lopo fouled Luka Modric in the box. The Portugal forward, rarely substituted, was taken off seconds later to the applause of the Santiago Bernabeu crowd.",Raw Data
816,"Pistons fans love to talk about the budding young stars we have on our team and so do I. Who doesnt love to watch and talk about Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe, to mention just the young big guys Joe Dumars has found in the past few drafts? But theres another player I love talking about Jason Maxiell. Hes one of my favorite Pistons of this era or any era, for that matter. He would have fit right in with the Bad Boys and he did fit right in with the Goin to Work bunch which he joined just a year after they won the 2004 NBA title in the unforgettable Five-Game Sweep of the Lakers. Jason is one of those let our play do the talking kind of guys. George Perles used to say, when I was broadcasting Michigan State football, work hard, keep your mouth shut and good things will happen and thats what Max does. Youve got to love him for that. Hes the kind of guy who gives you a days work for a days pay. Hes not even the least bit concerned about how many bumps and bruises he gets in doing his job. Thats why he was able to immediately earn the respect of tough NBA veterans like Ben Wallace and Rasheed Wallace when he first came to the Pistons in 2005. When a young guy comes along like Jason Maxiell, who is already a grown man physically, mentally and psychologically, the vets love to see that kind of guy step on the court. There are things everybody has to work on, of course, and Dave Cowens did a spectacular job getting Jason more comfortable at the free-throw line. If youre going to go inside and try to score, everyones going to end up at the free-throw line. Jason was always a pretty good jump shooter. I dont know why the free-throw line was a minor problem to begin with, but it isnt any more. He goes to the line feeling like he can make it, he has a good touch and he gets it done. Hes worked on the things hes had to work on and veterans appreciate that and they appreciate the fact he wont back down and he keeps his cool. He knows that he has a role with this team and hes proud to do that. Look at our game with Orlando on Tuesday night. The 105-90 win wasnt blown open until the third quarter when Greg and Andre came on strong, but if you dont get nine points and eight rebounds from Jason Maxiell in the first quarter, I dont know where you are in that game. The guards for the Magic, J.J. Redick and Jameer Nelson, couldnt miss. You were in a situation where you needed to get something done on the boards. The Pistons had four offensive rebounds in that quarter and Jason was a big part of that. Jason Maxiell isnt into politics in terms of personalities. Hes just his own man and everyone respects him for that. He and Lawrence Frank clicked immediately and its good to see Jason get major minutes. He was on his way to maybe 20 rebounds last night if they needed him to play more late in the ballgame, but he only needed to play 22, 23 minutes and still had a strong double-double. Hes the kind of guy opposing players dont like to play against. He doesnt take cheap shots at anybody, but he is so physical and so relentless inside that you have to know where he is. I think he makes guys think twice about coming into the paint. Hes also a heck of a shot-blocker in addition to being a physical presence, so there are a lot of reasons to stay away from Jason Maxiell in the paint. This is a guy who came into the league ready to go to battle. Lets also not forget he learned some very valuable lessons from some great inside players in Ben Wallace and Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess. He fit in beautifully with those guys and he kind of carried that torch on to this group and he continues to get better and better. As good as Andre Drummond is and as great as he might be someday, Jason Maxiell is going to continue to get his minutes because hes earned them and he deserves them.",Raw Data
817,"It seems the city of Seattle is about to get NBA justice. WHO SETS THE CURVE? Check out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo. But when it comes to the NBA, and the idea of justice for cities with teams and cities that want or deserve them, the right thing must always come at the expense of someone else. Thats the Catch-22 of reports that the Maloof family is closing in on a deal to sell the bulk of the Sacramento Kings to a group intending to move the team to Seattle. That is fantastic news for a fantastic city that lost its team to Oklahoma City. Clay Bennett bought the team in 2006 and took them from Seattle two years later. But it would come at the cost of another fantastic and deserving NBA town, Sacramento, that will lose one of its most cherished institutions. Unlike with Seattle, if the reports are true, Sacramento is unlikely to see NBA basketball within its borders for a long time, if ever again. FAN ROYALTY Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. What does this mean? That Seattle should ""do the right thing"" and refuse to ""steal"" Sacramentos team? Of course not. The practice of landing and retaining professional sports teams is a cutthroat business for those cities that decide to wade into the game. But it also lends the understandable hypocrisy to Seattles claims that Bennett was a bad guy for taking their team. Its just like the sports teams that these cities are competing over: There are no bad guys, just an opposition looking to win. The deal is not yet done, according to reports, and there may still be a ways to go. It is not news that the Maloof family might try to move, or even sell, the team. But sources in the organization were in the dark Wednesday about the state of things, waiting for word from their owners about what exactly is happening. A source close to ownership, when contacted, would neither confirm nor deny that the report was accurate, choosing instead to decline to comment. Still, if the team goes to Seattle, there will be a difficult justice in the move. Seattle lost the SuperSonics, now the Thunder, when an out-of-town owner brushed into town, bought the team, quarreled with lawmakers and took them back to his home state, Oklahoma City. OWN UP TO IT Franchise success or failure often can be traced to the top. We rank the five best and five worst NBA owners. So Seattle gets what it deserves by breaking the heart and hopes of Sacramento. Like Oklahoma City before them, the idea of a bad guy and a righteous actor in such moves depends on the eye of the beholder. Time will tell if this relocation is in fact a fact. Until then, its good for fans everywhere to remember the cliche that athletes use all the time: In the end, despite the love and loyalty and bonds built through professional sports, this is a business. And in every business you either win or you fail. Seattle knows the bitter end of this better than most. Soon they might heal those wounds at the expense of a city, Sacramento, to whom they will pass the pain.",Raw Data
818,"MINNEAPOLIS The man who ought to be the NFL's Most Valuable Player was still on the field, doing a postgame interview. The Minnesota Vikings' much-maligned owner was whooping it up as he scampered out of the locker room, ebullient that his team had won 10 games, seven more than last season. Players were singing and clapping about being the league's most surprising playoff team. Security guards were holding the locker room door open for the MVP, who was the last Viking on the field after one of the most exciting, storyline-filled games of the season. Moments before, the Vikings had secured their place in the playoffs with a last-second field goal to give them a 37-34 shootout victory in a win-and-you're-in game against the Green Bay Packers. Now, Adrian Peterson was asked a question by FOX's Pam Oliver. How did it feel to be 9 yards short of breaking Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record? ""Nine yards?"" Peterson replied, surprised. ""Nine yards, what? From breaking it?"" That's right. The man who just completed one of the most stunning seasons in NFL history 2,097 rushing yards, 13 touchdowns, an NFL-record seven games with more than 150 yards rushing, all this made more remarkable because it was done on a knee that was surgically reconstructed exactly one year ago Sunday had no idea where he stood. Most of football-watching America had been counting every yard as he closed in on the 28-year-old record. Peterson couldn't pay attention to any of that. There were more pressing matters at hand. Even when they flashed his face on the big screen to mark him passing the vaunted 2,000-yard mark, Peterson didn't look up. Peterson walked from the field to the locker room, his chance at the record gone but something more important now firmly in his grasp. His teammates shouted as the door closed behind him, their superstar ready to celebrate with his team. As the chattering class has done incessantly for the past few weeks, the chatter about who this league's MVP ought to be continues. The talk will continue for the next few days, until the ballots are cast and the playoffs begin. It can be hard, in such a team-oriented sport, to quantify the contributions of an individual. How can you say that what Peyton Manning did for the 13-3 Denver Broncos was worth more than what Tom Brady did for the 12-4 New England Patriots? How can you tell who carried more of his team's load, Aaron Rodgers as the league's top-ranked passer or J.J. Watt as the league's top-ranked pass rusher? What we can definitively say about Adrian Peterson, though, is this: Without him, the Minnesota Vikings are not a very good football team. But with him? With him they're heading to the playoffs on a four-game winning streak, and after a season that included upset victories over the Packers, the Houston Texans and the San Francisco 49ers. With him they're one of the few offenses left in the NFL that runs the ball first and passes second, and they're exciting when they do it. With him they were able to win 10 games despite having the fewest passing yards in the NFC, and the NFL's 26th-rated passing quarterback. With him they went on a 4-1 December tear, with Peterson's December stat line reading like this: 210 rushing yards in the first game, 154 in the next, 212 in the third, 86 last week, 199 on Sunday an NFL record for rushing yards in a single month. ""He's incredible,"" Rodgers said afterward. ""I just told him after the game he's the best. He's incredible to watch ... He probably might have won the MVP today."" Moments after the locker room door closed behind Peterson, another door opened. Peterson was standing at his locker. His backfield teammate, Toby Gerhart, gave him a hug. A team employee helped him tug his jersey over his shoulder pads. Wide receiver Michael Jenkins, who'd caught three passes for 37 yards and a crucial fourth-quarter touchdown, slapped Peterson on the shoulder: ""You did what you had to do."" When a Minneapolis reporter told him he'd had 199 rushing yards on the day he needed 208 to break the record Peterson shrugged and smiled. ""It's all good,"" he said. ""We live on for another day."" The only thing that mattered? As he'd told Oliver on the field moments before, ""We got the W."" Everything about the Vikings' upset win, which vaulted them into a playoff rematch next weekend against the Packers at Lambeau Field, could be traced back to Peterson. Like most teams do against the Vikings, the Packers stacked the box, bringing their safeties up to guard the run. That helped open up the passing game, and second-year quarterback Christian Ponder capitalized. He played perhaps his best game as a pro, completing 16 of 28 passes for 234 yards, three touchdowns and, most importantly, zero interceptions. On the first play of a fourth-quarter drive when the game was tied, the Vikings figured the Packers would key on the run because of Peterson's dominance. So offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave called a play-action pass, and Ponder lofted one of the most beautiful passes of his career, a 65-yarder to a streaking Jarius Wright, which set up a touchdown. And on the final drive, with the ball at midfield, the Vikings gave the ball to Peterson three times in a row: Four yards on the first. Zero yards on the second. And then on the third play, a 26-yard dash that brought the fans to their feet, hoping he could both set the record and send the Vikings to the playoffs in one fell swoop. He didn't. But instead of a dicey 50-or-so-yard field goal, Blair Walsh hit a 29-yard chip shot as time expired, and the Vikings lived another day. Never mind the inspiring part of this story: That the first four games of this season Peterson couldn't cut from the left to the right because of his freshly repaired knee. Never mind the pressure put on Peterson's shoulders: As the Vikings have gone on this incredible December tear, it's been without the other dynamic weapon of their offense, Percy Harvin, who has been out since November with an injured ankle. Just point to this: In their confidence, in their obvious joy with which they play the game, in their never-say-die attitude, the Vikings are a completely different team when Peterson's on the field. ""I don't think his season this year compares to anything else I've seen in this league,"" Carl Eller, the Vikings Hall of Fame defensive end, said in the Vikings' locker room. ""It's not so much the record, which he came awfully close to. His tenacity. His enthusiasm and dedication and commitment. He lifts a team. He really does lift a team."" Head coach Leslie Frazier heaped praise on Peterson afterward: ""He is without question the best running back in our game, and truly in my mind MVP of our league. We don't win this game today without the effort of Adrian Peterson."" But what Eller said, that Peterson lifts this team on his shoulders with both his violent running style and his contagious attitude, is perhaps the truest example of why Peterson should be this league's MVP. After showering and dressing, Peterson walked out of the locker room and into the interview room. He was dressed like a movie star, with a plaid tie framed by a sharp tan trench coat. He said he heard when the crowd was chanting ""MVP!,"" and that he soaked it all in. He said he was bummed that he didn't get the record but didn't pay attention to his rushing totals, just winning: ""I never knew. I never knew. And I really wasn't worried about it. I told myself I was coming into this game focused on one thing, and that was winning."" Yeah, sure, it's a clich. Player doesn't care about self; player cares only about team. In football, that mentality is more ingrained than in any other sport. You hear it so much in locker rooms that it makes your brain numb. But step back for a moment, forgetting about repaired knees and all-time great record. Just look at what this one player has meant to his team, a team that was supposed to be in a rebuilding season but that just sneaked into the playoffs by beating one of the NFL's juggernauts. If that's not the definition of an MVP, I don't know what is.",Raw Data
819,"﻿Technically, the San Francisco 49ers are the home team in Super Bowl XLVII, and as grand arrivals go, their landing in New Orleans on an unseasonably warm Sunday evening was rather calm and unassuming. Players casually walked off the team plane dressed in casual attire, minus handheld video recorders recording the moment. Nobody waved to the crowd. They offered no real hint of the hoopla to come. Only a 49ers team flag flapping in the breeze from an open window of their charter plane marked the franchise’s official return to a Super Bowl for the first time since 1995. The 49ers have won five Lombardi Trophies, but their proclaimed “Quest for Six” will need to go through the Baltimore Ravens, who are set to arrive Monday. And while there is a lot of attention on second-year quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose 10th NFL start will come next Sunday, there also is a palpable sense that the 49ers have been here, done that, and can do it again. Maybe it’s because Kaepernick’s first NFL road start came in Week 12 at the New Orleans Superdome, a 31-21 victory over the Saints that offered another tantalizing peek at the complex zone-read option scheme the 49ers employ to capitalize on the quarterback’s uncommon speed and athleticism. Kaepernick can keep plays alive with his feet and he extends the down with his fast-tempo style. He has the arm strength to find receivers deep. Altogether, it’s a pretty devastating package. But Kaepernick is also quick to admit that at the start of the 2012 season, he never would have envisioned himself front and center at Super Bowl week. Yeah, the Harbaughs will be the media darlings. But don't sleep on these names come Super Bowl XLVII. “At the start of the season, I was just hoping to be on the field some way, somehow,” Kaepernick said Sunday night at the 49ers’ team hotel just off the French Quarter. That opportunity came when starter and former No. 1 overall pick Alex Smith went down with a concussion midseason. Kaepernick played so well in his first two starts as a replacement — passing for 474 yards, three touchdowns and one interception in wins over the Bears and Saints — that the No. 1 job became his permanently. Everyone knows ultra-intense 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh was an NFL quarterback for 14 seasons, albeit without the eye-popping playmaking potential of his young protégé. That shared knowledge of and passion for the position has drawn the second-year head coach and second-year player even closer. “It’s definitely beneficial,” Kaepernick said of Harbaugh’s quarterback pedigree. “He knows what you’re looking at. He knows what you’re going through. It makes it easier for him to relate.” Perhaps it was that mutual vision for quarterbacking that allowed Harbaugh to make the unorthodox final call to sit Smith for good after the Saints’ road win and stick with the hot backup passer — despite the fact team doctors had cleared Smith to play. For that, the coach won’t be second-guessed. “I thought it was a unique situation,” said Harbaugh, who along with general manager Trent Baalke personally scouted Kaepernick at Nevada-Reno and grabbed him in the second round of the 2011 draft. “My experience had always been when it comes to playing the best quarterback, you play the quarterback with the hot hand . . . I made the decision I thought was best for our team.” Does Harbaugh see a little of himself in a very grounded and focused Kaepernick? “When Colin is running, the stride he has, the gracefulness with his stride, the ground that he covers, how fast and how quick he is, he reminds me of myself,” Harbaugh said, grinning widely. “Then I wake up,” added Harbaugh, laughing some more, and that may be the lone bit of humor we get from this guy all week. No matter. His players, an established group of winners who embraced Harbaugh’s structure and offensive mind following a rudderless ride with former coach Mike Singletary, have bought in all the way and feed off Harbaugh’s unflappable mentality. Free safety Dashon Goldson coined a phrase during this wildly successful 49ers’ playoff run that has been a bulletin board staple for the team the past two weeks: “We get fresher under pressure” the quote reads. “These are uncharted waters for a rookie Super Bowl coach,” conceded Harbaugh, who is facing his brother John, the Ravens head coach, on Super Bowl Sunday. “But it’s exciting, too. We have a great thrill, a great desire, to be in uncharted waters. Our coaches and our players have always relished that, always thrive in that environment.” On Day 1 in New Orleans, the 49ers seemed to chart a pretty good start for themselves.",Raw Data
820,"Cory Schneider made 30 saves in his fifth career shutout, Mason Raymond scored twice, and the Vancouver Canucks avenged last week's blowout loss to Anaheim with three power-play goals in a 5-0 win over the Ducks on Friday night. Daniel Sedin and Raymond scored on power plays in the first period, and Zack Kassian added a man-advantage goal in the third period as the Canucks quieted Anaheim's standing-room-only crowd at the final home opener of the NHL's lockout-shortened season. Schneider bounced back splendidly from his season-opening pratfall as the Canucks' new starting goalie last Saturday in Vancouver, where the Ducks chased him with five goals in 27 minutes. Jonas Hiller stopped 29 shots, but Anaheim couldn't get off to a 3-0-0 start for the second time in franchise history. Aaron Volpatti also scored and captain Henrik Sedin had two assists as Vancouver opened a three-game California road trip, its first of the season after a 1-1-1 start at home. The Canucks' two early power-play goals ruined a celebratory atmosphere at Honda Center for the Ducks, who started the season with a 7-3 win in Vancouver and another high-scoring victory in Calgary. Anaheim was 2-0-0 to start a season for just the second time in franchise history, but couldn't match its franchise-best start in the 2006-07 season, when the Ducks went on to win the Stanley Cup. The Ducks took themselves out of the game early with penalties, allowing seven power-play goals already this season. With Daniel Winnik and Ryan Getzlaf in the box together for 89 seconds midway through the first period, Henrik Sedin found his brother with a cross-ice pass for Daniel's second goal of the season. Late in the period, Vancouver's power play capitalized again when Raymond swatted his own rebound out of the air past Hiller. Vancouver also took 2-0 leads in its last two games, but coughed them up before splitting shootouts with Calgary and Edmonton. After Alex Burrows was awarded a penalty shot in the second period when Luca Sbisa stopped his breakaway out of the penalty box, Hiller stopped him. But Volpatti pounced on a turnover in the slot and beat Hiller later in the period. Kassian scored on a power play and Raymond scored a 4-on-4 goal in the third period, which also featured Corey Perry battering Keith Ballard in a fight in which the Vancouver defenseman didn't throw a punch. The Canucks played without center Manny Malhotra, who wasn't with the team after his wife, Joann, gave birth to a baby boy Thursday. NOTES: New Anaheim assistant coach Scott Niedermayer didn't attend the game. The four-time NHL champion defenseman was in Kamloops, B.C., where the WHL's Blazers retired his No. 28 jersey. ...

Analysis - UK Athletics head coach Peter Eriksson on 5 live ""We said we were going to do better and we did a little better than last time (France 2011) with one more gold medal. Eight medals is what we can expect. It's early in the season, we have a young team. I'm really happy with it. All of the women went to the final and only three of the guys didn't, so that's a great achievement. We're in great shape because we have a lot of young athletes coming up through the system."" Britain also took gold in the men's 4x400m after being briefly disqualified for an infringement. Nigel Levine won silver in the 400m and Mukhtar Mohammed took 800m bronze. In all, Britain won eight medals, with Holly Bleasdale's pole vault title on Saturday making it four golds alongside three silvers and a bronze. The women's 4x400m team, led off by Child, led from the very first leg to win in a new championship record of three minutes 27.56 seconds, finishing 0.22 ahead of Russia, with Czech Republic getting bronze. Shortly afterwards the men's team of Michael Bingham, Richard Buck, Levine, who ran a superb third leg to put them in the lead, and Richard Strachan clocked 3:06.96 to finish more than half a second clear of Russia. They were initially disqualified because Buck came off the track but that was overturned when it emerged he had been knocked by a Polish rival.

""I just hope it will benefit me when it comes to the outdoors really."" While Shakes-Drayton was one of the favourites heading into her race, Levine had to produce a season's best to take silver behind her. ""I can't believe it,"" she said.

822,"About the only thing Patrick Marleau is struggling at so far this season is finding an explanation for his record start. Marleau became the second player in NHL history to open a season with four straight multigoal games, striking twice on the power play in the first period Saturday in the San Jose Sharks' 4-0 victory over the Colorado Avalanche. ''I'll keep taking them if they keep coming,'' he said. ''That's for sure.'' Marleau has scored two goals in each game this season, joining Ottawa's Cy Denneny in 1917-18 as the only players to open a campaign with four multigoal games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. ''He obviously has a hot hand right now,'' defenseman Brad Stuart said. ''We'll need contributions from everyone at some point. But right now Patty is playing amazing and putting the puck in the net every time he touches it, it seems like.'' Both of Marleau's goals came after Ryan O'Byrne took two additional minor penalties for retaliating after Stuart flattened Colorado captain Gabriel Landeskog with a vicious hit. Joe Thornton added a power-play goal in the second period, giving San Jose 10 power-play goals in four games and a franchise record 19 overall. Thomas Greiss made 24 saves for his first career shutout and Matt Irwin got his first career goal as the Sharks are off to their best start since also winning the first four games in 2008-09. The Avalanche lost their seventh straight game in San Jose since winning Game 1 of their first-round playoff series in 2010. After killing off 16 straight penalties coming into this game, Colorado allowed goals on San Jose's first three power plays, including two after the hit on Landeskog. ''You have a situation where a teammate is defending another teammate which is the game of hockey and in those situations we need to step up and get the job done for our teammate,'' Colorado coach Joe Sacco said. ''We just didn't get it done. That was the difference in the game.'' San Jose's power play is in midseason form in this lockout-shortened season, with 10 goals in 24 chances. Marleau has four of those goals as he is off to a scintillating start. He is the first Sharks player ever with four straight multigoal games and has outscored the Sharks' opponents, who have seven goals in four games. ''I don't know if he can keep scoring two goals every night. But he can keep his play up the way it's been,'' coach Todd McLellan said. ''He's been skating extremely well. A ton of confidence. He's prepared to shoot the puck. He's engaged physically. It's a great reward for him. He came focused to play.'' The Sharks took more than 12 minutes to get their first shot on goal, but managed to take a 2-0 lead in the first period because of stellar special teams play and a big hit by Stuart that changed the complexion of the game. San Jose's troubled penalty-kill unit was up to the task early, allowing no shots on two power plays for Colorado. Then San Jose's dangerous power-play took over late in the period after Stuart's big hit that Landeskog felt was clean even if his coach thought it should have been a penalty. ''It was hard, that much I could tell you,'' he said. ''I was reaching for the puck and didn't brace myself enough, Stuart stepped up and that's the way hockey always is. It was a big one. I knew he was there but I didn't think he was coming at me. Then he came and I saw him at the last second but not nearly early enough.'' O'Byrne took offense and challenged Stuart to a fight. The Sharks came out of the scrum with two power plays after O'Byrne got hit with an instigator penalty and one for fighting with a facemask. Landeskog left the game briefly before returning for the second period. Marleau and the Sharks made Colorado pay. Just 28 seconds into the first power play, Marleau whacked at a rebound and knocked it past Semyon Varlamov to give San Jose the lead. He delivered again on the second power play after a nifty passing display from Dan Boyle to Thornton to Marleau, who tapped the puck in by the side of the net for his fourth straight two-goal game. ''We weren't playing particularly well. Then you get those two power plays and boom, boom, it's 2-0,'' Thornton said. ''Really it was a huge momentum switch for us.'' Notes: Marleau is the first NHL player with fourth consecutive multigoal games since Alexander Mogilny had five straight in 1992-93 for Buffalo. ... Recently signed Scott Gomez made his Sharks debut on the fourth line in place of James Sheppard and also got time on the second power-play unit. ... O'Byrne got 19 minutes of penalties for his scuffle with Stuart as both players were sent off for fighting and O'Byrne got an additional 10-minute misconduct.",Raw Data
823,"Jovan Belcher's mother begged her son's dying girlfriend to stay alive while frantically asking for an ambulance shortly after the Kansas City Chiefs linebacker shot the mother of his 3-month-old daughter, according to a recording released Wednesday of the emergency call. Belcher, 25, shot 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins at their Kansas City home Saturday morning, then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, where he shot himself in the head in front of Chiefs general manager Scott Pioli and Coach Romeo Crennel, police said. ''She's still breathing but please hurry,'' Cheryl Shepherd says on the recording of her call with Kansas City emergency dispatchers. ''I don't know how he (inaudible), they were arguing, please hurry.'' Shepherd also is heard encouraging Perkins to stay alive. ''Stay with me, the ambulance is on the way. Stay with me Kasandra, stay with me,'' Shepherd yells. Shepherd told dispatchers that Perkins was bleeding, ''just barely'' awake and that it looked as though she was wounded in the back. She said Perkins moved when she spoke to her. When a police dispatcher asked about Belcher, Shepherd says only: ''He left.'' When police arrived at the couple's home at about 7:50 a.m., they found Perkins' body on the floor of the master bathroom with multiple gunshot wounds, according to a police incident report. Friends have said the couple had a strained relationship in the weeks before the shooting. The days since Belcher killed his girlfriend and then himself have been very difficult for his mother, who said Wednesday that the slayings have not diminished her love for the couple. Shepherd had been living with her son and 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins to help care for their 3-month-old daughter, Zoey. ''That's my son, and I love him,'' Shepherd said in a brief telephone conversation Wednesday. ''She's my daughter-in-law, just like my daughter.'' Shepherd, 54, declined to say anything more about her son but did say she was not happy about the release Wednesday of recordings of the emergency phone call she made Saturday after Perkins was shot. ''I just got a phone call that they did that, and I don't appreciate it,'' she said. ''Right now I don't want to talk about it.'' Shepherd, who has temporary custody of the couple's baby, said she and Perkins were very close. ''She was a lovely, beautiful young woman. And we had a beautiful relationship,'' Shepherd said. Shepherd said her family has been helping her a great deal since the shootings, but that she has had trouble eating and sleeping as she works on her son's funeral arrangements. ''Right now I'm working on everything,'' she said. Hours before the murder-suicide, police found Belcher sleeping in his car outside an apartment complex about 10 miles from the home he shared with Perkins and their child. He told officers he was at the apartment to visit a woman he described as his girlfriend, but that she wasn't home. Belcher then made a phone call and a woman let him into the building, police said. Police did not question the woman and said they don't know who she is. Belcher and Perkins lived apart recently but got back together by Thanksgiving, friend Brianne York told The Associated Press. At Arrowhead, Belcher thanked Pioli and Crennel for all they had done for him. The men tried to persuade Belcher to put down his handgun but when police arrived, Belcher moved behind a vehicle, knelt down and shot himself once in the head, police said.",Raw Data

''We now have to wait for the results of tests, but the feeling is that it isn't more serious than a knock.'' Messi, who went on as a reserve in the 58th minute, collided with Benfica goalkeeper Artur in the 85th and was in obvious pain clutching his knee when he fell to the turf after weakly attempting a chipped shot. As Messi dribbled into the box, Artur made contact with the forward to silence the Camp Nou, which is not used to seeing the star injured. ''He's receiving medical tests, let's hope it's nothing serious and that he can soon be with us back to 100 percent,'' captain Carles Puyol said. Messi has scored 84 times in 2012 to be only one short of tying Gerd Mueller's 40-year-old record for most goals in a calendar year. Vilanova said Messi always prefers to play and isn't focused on Mueller's record. ''Had we been worried just about the record we would have played Messi right from the beginning,'' Vilanova said. ''But we had talked about it and decided to bring him on with half an hour to play.'' Benfica looked the sharper side in the first half, while Barcelona dominated in the second. Barcelona had already qualified for the knockout phase in top spot from Group G. Ola John's pass from midfield allowed Rodrigo Moreno to beat the offside trap and race forward accompanied by two Benfica forwards, all three clear of Barcelona's defense, but the Brazil-born Spanish striker shot wide in the 11th minute. A minute later, Lima had a shot deflected by Barcelona goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto. Manuel ''Nolito'' Duran crossed to an unmarked Lima in the penalty area for the Benfica striker to head just wide in the 20th. Barcelona winger Cristian Tello missed in the 23rd before Lima's 32nd-minute shot was deflected by Pinto onto the goal-frame. John beat Barcelona's defense again in the 35th but Pinto dived to turn the ball wide. ''It was a game in which it was clear that we wanted to win even though we started with many young players,'' Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara said. As the halftime whistle blew, fans in the stadium chanted Messi's name. Barcelona looked refreshed in the second half, attacking more and stringing together more passes, until Messi came on for Brazilian midfielder Rafinha to an ovation from the fans.",Raw Data
825,"NOTRE DAME, Ind. -- Odyssey Sims had a little bit of rust to shake off. But that didn't take long. After missing the equivalent of five games -- she suffered an injured hamstring early in Baylor's loss to Stanford on Nov. 16 in Hawaii -- the Lady Bears' point guard was back on the floor. And everything just seemed ""right"" with Baylor again. In a 73-61 victory over Notre Dame on Wednesday, Sims missed her first five shots, and her passes weren't as crisp as we're used to. At one point, she airmailed a ball in the general direction of center Brittney Griner, a target whom Sims rarely misses. Especially not by a mile. But, hey, even outstanding players need a little time to get their mojo back when they've been sidelined. By the time the game was over, Sims had 16 points and six assists (with, admittedly, seven turnovers). And defensively, she had helped thoroughly frustrate her Irish counterpart, Skylar Diggins. [+] Enlarge Matt Cashore/USA TODAY Sports Baylor coach Kim Mulkey admitted that Odyssey Sims didn't have one of her best games, but ""she never stopped being tough on that floor, and she never stopped guarding people."" ""This is the best point guard in the country,"" Baylor coach Kim Mulkey said, motioning toward the junior Sims in the postgame news conference. ""You can put that in your notes."" Mulkey is never shy about going to bat for her players, and she wanted to get a message across about Sims. Not really to take a dig at Diggins, who was red-eyed and disappointed after a 4-of-19 night from the field when she finished with eight points in the Irish's first loss this season. Rather, Mulkey's barb was more toward the hype about Diggins that she doesn't think Sims gets, but deserves. ""What else does she have to do to get that recognition?"" Mulkey said. ""She's played Skylar four times now and won every ballgame. She's won a national championship."" It can't surprise you, of course, that Mulkey knew exactly how many times Notre Dame and Baylor have met, all with Diggins and Sims on the court. Not a lot of details escape Mulkey's mind, and certainly not when they can be effectively used to illustrate a point she wants to make. The first Baylor-Notre Dame meeting was in December 2010, when Sims was a freshman and Diggins a sophomore. Then they faced off twice last season: in the Preseason WNIT final in November, and the NCAA final in April. Wednesday in front of a sold-out crowd at Purcell Pavilion, in her hometown and on national television, the senior Diggins surely would have liked it to be her night. But it wasn't, and Sims had a lot to do with that. “ What else does she have to do to get that recognition? She's played Skylar [Diggins] four times now and won every ballgame. She's won a national championship. ” -- Coach Kim Mulkey on Baylor point guard Odyssey Sims Mulkey always says she's the harshest judge of point guards, having been one herself. But for the most part, she finds Sims typically meeting or exceeding expectations. ""Odyssey didn't have one of her best games, either,"" Mulkey said. ""But she never stopped being tough on that floor, and she never stopped guarding people. And that's a kid who hasn't played in 2½ weeks."" Sims had no interest in fanning any flame about her game versus Diggins -- ""It's always fun going against great players but we don't have a rivalry"" -- but Sims didn't need to, either. As Mulkey said, Sims has the results that speak volumes. Meanwhile, Griner had one of those ""quiet"" double-doubles: 24 points and 14 rebounds. She didn't force the action, but the numbers still piled up for her. And when asked the standard question about how she has learned the lesson of ""letting the game come to her,"" Griner made one of her classic dry witticisms. ""I just let that come to me as well,"" Griner said with a little grin, then added, ""about last year, I guess. I just was being more patient. I keep moving; I'm drawing some people to me, so somebody's open on my team."" One of the players Wednesday who benefited from the attention Griner always gets was fellow senior Jordan Madden, who finished with 12 points and eight assists. Madden has the well-earned ""defensive stopper"" reputation, but this game was an example of how she can damage opponents with her offense, too. [+] Enlarge Joe Robbins/Getty ImagesBrittney Griner hit 10 of 16 shots to score 24 points, and grabbed 14 rebounds. And another Baylor senior, Brooklyn Pope, was terrific off the bench, scoring 14 points on 7-of-10 shooting. Starter Kimetria ""Nae-Nae"" Hayden was apparently in hot water with Mulkey for an unexplained reason, and played just eight minutes. But the Lady Bears still had enough options without her. ""It's a comfort zone when you have that many returning players,"" Mulkey said of the fact that Baylor has back all its starters from the 40-0 championship team. ""But as I told them in the locker room after the game, my comfort zone has extended now to more players."" Speaking of comfort zones, Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw actually is in one even though she lost three starters off last season's NCAA runner-up team. McGraw is developing a lot of youngsters, led by freshman sensation-in-the-making Jewell Loyd. Yes, she has two ""L's"" in Jewell and only one in Loyd -- which is kind of the opposite of what you might expect -- but you probably won't see very many L's, as in losses, associated with this kid. She's going to help Notre Dame add quite a few W's to its record. The freshman guard out of suburban Chicago led the Irish with 24 points, while Kayla McBride scored 18 and Natalie Achonwa had 11. Those three and Diggins accounted for all of Notre Dame's points. But McGraw was in an upbeat mood afterward, and she should be. The growth potential for the Irish seems tremendous. ""It's fun. It's like a puzzle, trying to put the pieces together,"" McGraw said. ""Some days, the pieces fit really well together, and some days I'm still tinkering. I'm enjoying it."" Meanwhile, the right pieces are all there for Baylor, especially now with Sims having returned. ""I was excited to be back out there with my team,"" Sims said. ""And be able to lead them."" As Griner put it: ""It's nice to see Odyssey out there giving the [other] point guard heck. That trickles down to the wing players and post players. She gets us going."" Recommend 0",Raw Data
826,"﻿ The only proof UFC flyweight champ Demetrious Johnson had of this birth father was the child support checks he sent. An absentee birth father gave way to an abusive stepfather, who abandoned Johnson, his two siblings and his mother when Johnson was in first grade. “I didn’t go through life thinking I was different from anybody else,” Johnson told FOXSports.com. “A lot of people were worse off than I was. You just took whatever you got and tried to make the most of it. My mom did a great job raising me. It was all her.” Johnson, 26, hasn’t heard from his biological father even as he shot up the MMA ranks and prepared for the most hyped flyweight fight in history, Saturday’s UFC on FOX 6 main event against John Dodson. Much of the nation has the opportunity as well since his bout will be on broadcast TV. It has been hyped as “world championship,” not a flyweight title fight. It's both. Makes sense. This is a new division --- Johnson (16-2-1) beat Joseph Benavidez via a split decision to become the first UFC flyweight champ in September --- and respect has been hard to come by for a weight class that has a cutoff of 125 pounds. His fight against Benavidez drew boos from the fans in Toronto despite it being one of the most active of the night in the Octagon. UFC president Dana White reacted harshly to the jeers both in the arena and on Twitter. “You're a moron (and) you don't like fighting,"" White said immediately after the fight to the naysayers. “You don't appreciate great talent or heart if you didn't like that flyweight fight."" Johnson, as you’d expect from somebody from his background, took it in stride. “Fans always boo,” Johnson said. “I went back and watched the fight. We were doing some really good things. It didn’t mean anything to me. We just need to get the fans more educated about the division. Eventually, we’ll get there.” At 5-foot-3, Johnson has spent much of his life proving himself athletically. “I started in basketball and then football,” Johnson said. “I just kept playing sports until I eventually found wrestling. I wanted to be famous for something. I wanted to be known for something. Wrestling got me on that track.” Johnson attended a community college in suburban Seattle before he decided to forgo his studies and concentrate on MMA. It was about that time he met his future wife, Destiny Bartels, while both worked at a Red Lobster. The two were married in May. “I don’t let my past affect me as best I can,” Johnson said. “It’s just something I had to go through. That’s it.” Johnson’s more immediate past hasn’t been without some grief, either. His mother, Karen Crowe, was diagnosed with cancer and Johnson often drove her to and from chemotherapy treatments between workouts. “She’s doing well,” Johnson said. “She’s completely healthy and enjoying life.” Crowe didn’t approve of Johnson wrestling as a youth. That could be one explanation why MMA is never a topic of conversation. “We don’t talk about fighting at all,” Johnson said. “I don’t think she’s a big fight fan. I don’t see her saying, ‘Ooh. There’s a big Alistair Overeem fight. I have to make sure I’m home in time to watch it.’” Johnson might not be able to convert his mother just yet. As far as the rest of the national TV audience, Johnson said he’s more concerned with winning matches than winning fans. “I am excited for this opportunity, and I love the fact that this is the main event on FOX,” Johnson said. “Still, it doesn’t change anything for me. They can put this event on PBS after ‘Sesame Street’ and I’d approach it exactly the same.”",Raw Data
827,"Tianna Hawkins scored 17 points, Katie Rutan had 16 points off four 3-pointers and No. 10 Maryland defeated Clemson 80-40 on Sunday for its 12th straight win over the Tigers. The Terps (17-3, 8-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) won their seventh straight since their lone league loss to North Carolina back on Jan. 3. Maryland dominated the rematch with the Tar Heels this past Thursday, 85-59, and kept the offensive show going at Littlejohn Coliseum. Hawkins, the ACC's leading scorer, made 7 of 12 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds. Alyssa Thomas, second to Hawkins in league scoring and tied with her in ACC rebounding, had 10 points and 10 rebounds for her 12th double-double for the season. Alicia DeVaughn had 14 points and Maryland had five players in double figure scoring. Nikki Dixon had 17 points to lead Clemson, which has lost seven of eight. Maryland outrebounded Clemson 44-23 and held the Lady Tigers to 25 percent shooting (14 of 56) for the game. Rutan, a transfer from Xavier in her first season, had her most points in ACC play and was 4 of 6 from three-point range. Freshman Malina Howard had 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting for Maryland, also her best showing against a league opponent. The Terps feature the ACC's scoring and rebounding leaders in Hawkins and Thomas. Hawkins leads the league in scoring at 19.2 points a game and the two share the ACC rebounding lead at 10.3 a game, although Thomas is credited with one more rebound than her teammate (196 to 195) this season. Maryland had won its past 11 games over the Lady Tigers coming in and made sure it wouldn't get caught napping after its dominating, 85-59, victory over No. 11 North Carolina this past Thursday night. The Terps made six of their first seven shots and built a 13-2 lead that only increased at Littlejohn Coliseum. Rutan was the big reason why, breaking things wide open with three consecutive 3-pointers. Howard's bucket gave Maryland a 36-16 lead and Chloe Pavlech followed with a 3-pointer. And the Terps accomplished the large lead without Thomas, held to one field goal the first 20 minutes. The Lady Tigers had hung tough with fourth-ranked Duke for about 30 minutes before falling 60-46 last Thursday night. This time, they didn't have the height or stamina to stay with Maryland. Clemson went more than 10 minutes without a field goal as the Terps went on a 22-4 run to the finish of the half. The Lady Tigers made only 7 of 27 shots the opening half and were outrebounded 25-9. Maryland started three players up front in Hawkins, Thomas and DeVaughn who are 6-foot-2 or taller - more than Clemson had available for the game. The game was the second of a doubleheader after Clemson's men beat Virginia Tech 77-70 and the school hoped for a solid crowd for the women's game.

He also is a frequent host on Sirius XM NFL Radio. The Falcons are the only newcomer to this season’s four-team field in the NFL conference championship games. San Francisco, New England and Baltimore are all making return trips, marking the first time three squads are back since Dallas, San Francisco and Buffalo pulled the repeat in the 1993 season. The Ravens and Patriots are also the first two AFC teams to meet in a conference championship rematch since Cleveland and Denver played 25 seasons ago. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, no four-team coupling has ever made repeat appearances in the conference title games. The chances for that happening this season ended when the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants failed to reach the playoffs. Here’s a preview of Sunday’s Falcons-49ers and Ravens-Patriots matchups. San Francisco (12-4-1) at Atlanta (14-3) Reviewing the second round: With 31 seconds remaining in Sunday’s game between Seattle and Atlanta in the Georgia Dome, Marshawn Lynch scored on a 2-yard run and it appeared a third matchup this season between NFC West rivals was in the offing. The Falcons, though, drove 41 yards in 23 seconds for Matt Bryant’s game-winning field goal with eight seconds remaining to seal a 30-28 victory over Seattle, meaning the 49ers would be headed to Atlanta rather than hosting the Seahawks next weekend. San Francisco didn’t have to sweat nearly as much, blowing open a 45-31 home win over Green Bay in the second half. San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick set an NFL single-game rushing record for a quarterback with 181 yards and two touchdowns. He also passed for 263 more yards and another two scores. Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan wasn’t as spectacular, but he did complete two passes for 41 yards on the final drive to put Bryant in position for his 49-yard kick. The win marked Ryan’s 22nd career fourth-quarter/overtime comeback and his first career playoff victory. Last meeting: The Falcons and 49ers haven’t met since Week 4 of the 2010 season at the Georgia Dome. At that time, Mike Singletary was San Francisco’s head coach and Kaepernick was playing at the University of Nevada. The Falcons won, 16-14, when Bryant hit a 43-yard field goal with two seconds remaining. 49ers player to watch: Tight end Vernon Davis. An afterthought since Kaepernick replaced Alex Smith as San Francisco’s starting quarterback, Davis had a 44-yard catch down the seam against Green Bay that led to a 49ers touchdown. Davis was targeted five times overall by Kaepernick. He could get even more opportunities Sunday considering the damage caused by Seattle tight end Zach Miller (eight catches for 142 yards and one touchdown) against Atlanta’s defense. Falcons player to watch: Defensive end John Abraham. The NFL’s active leader in sacks (122) aggravated an ankle injury late in the second quarter against Seattle and didn’t return. Without him on the field, the Falcons couldn’t sack Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson in the fourth quarter on his 13 pass attempts. Abraham is Atlanta’s only major pass-rushing threat, leading the team with 10 this season. No other Falcons defender had more than four sacks during the regular season. Summary: The experience of playing a mobile quarterback like Wilson had better help the Falcons prepare for Kaepernick, who is even more dangerous running the read-option behind a bullying offensive line. Otherwise, Atlanta will be in deep trouble. The Falcons did a solid job holding Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch to 46 rushing yards and forcing a fumble, but San Francisco’s ground game is even more prolific. The 49ers won’t get caught off-guard by Atlanta’s rushing attack like the Seahawks did with Michael Turner pacing the team’s season-high 167-yard effort with 98 yards. If Atlanta’s offensive line can hold up as well as it did against Seattle, Ryan will have the chance to make some hay downfield with wide receivers Roddy White and Julio Jones. 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree continued his hot play by scorching the Packers with nine catches for 119 yards and two scores. The Falcons know they can rely upon a clutch kicker in Bryant; the 49ers have to hope that David Akers is back on track after making his lone attempt against Green Bay. Baltimore (12-6) at New England (13-4) Reviewing the second round: A regular-season win over Houston in Week 14 helped the Patriots edge the Texans for a first-round playoff bye and home-field advantage in the divisional round. New England didn’t squander it by posting a 41-28 victory at Gillette Stadium. The Ravens, who lost to Denver in Week 15, were far more successful in their rematch with a 38-35 triumph over the Broncos in double-overtime. The victory, though, was improbable as quarterback Joe Flacco connected with Jacoby Jones on a 70-yard touchdown pass with 31 seconds left in regulation to tie the score. The Patriots had an easier time with Houston, holding a double-digit lead for nearly the entire second half. Leading the way was quarterback Tom Brady, who threw for 344 yards and three touchdowns without a turnover. Last meeting: Justin Tucker’s 27-yard field goal as time expired gave Baltimore a 31-30 home win in Week 3. Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith’s big day Saturday against the Broncos — three catches for 98 yards and two touchdowns — should come as no surprise to the Patriots. Smith was even more effective against New England with 127 yards and two scores on six receptions. Ravens player to watch: Left tackle Bryant McKinnie. Now that he has gotten back into shape and out of head coach John Harbaugh’s doghouse, McKinnie has helped stabilize an offensive line that did a masterful job protecting Flacco against Indianapolis and Denver. The Ravens also may be catching a break as Patriots rookie defensive end Chandler Jones (45 tackles, six sacks in the regular season) suffered an ankle injury in the second quarter against Houston and didn’t return. Patriots player to watch: Defensive tackle Vince Wilfork. He was a beast in last year’s AFC title game win over the Ravens, registering six tackles (three for losses) and one sack as well as creating plays for others by overwhelming Baltimore’s offensive line late in the game. Wilfork’s play didn’t dip in 2012 as he recently earned first-team All-Pro honors for the first time in his nine-year NFL career. Summary: The spark brought by the playoff return of inside linebacker Ray Lewis from a torn triceps and Baltimore’s quest to get him to a Super Bowl before his impending retirement has helped the Ravens reach their third AFC title game in five seasons. The Ravens lost in last season’s conference championship when Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal in the waning seconds. The Ravens should feel more confident in Tucker, who has made 32 of 35 attempts in his rookie season. Flacco outplayed Brady in last year’s matchup, which may provide further motivation for the latter entering this contest. Brady will be without one of his favorite receiving targets as tight end Rob Gronkowski broke his left forearm again vs. Houston. He is out for the season. The Patriots are a much better running team now than when facing Baltimore in Week 3. Stevan Ridley and Shane Vereen both scored against Houston. The status of fellow running back Danny Woodhead is in question after he injured his thumb Sunday.",Raw Data
830,"It's never nice when someone loses their job. Some will argue that sympathy is a human weakness, and gets in the way of progress. Of course, those people are probably psychopaths, but you can't deny that we'd probably get stuff done an awful lot quicker were it not for emotions. It was therefore understandable that the football world seemed to join hands and unite in sympathy for Nigel Adkins, sacked by Southampton after two successive promotions just as he seemed to be turning this season around. The dismissal was obviously extremely harsh on Adkins. It's almost impossible to think what else he could have done in his two-and-a-half years at the club, and to many Nicola Cortese made an inexplicable decision. Except it really isn't that inexplicable. For a start, the wisdom or otherwise of any sacking cannot be judged until we know how well their replacement fares. The obvious example is the Chris Hughton/Alan Pardew crossover at Newcastle, but a more recent precedent is Steve Bruce taking over from the much-loved Nick Barmby at Hull. Barmby was dismissed shortly after Hull had finished eighth in the Championship, and now under Steve Bruce they're third, behind Leicester only on goal difference. Only until Mauricio Pochettino has been at the club for a few months will we be able to judge the logic of the move. In any case, much of the outrage was down to the timing of the announcement, because Southampton seem to be on such a good run, having lost just twice in the previous ten games. However, at his unveiling Pochettino let slip that he had been studying the team for a few weeks, suggesting that the decision to replace Adkins had been made some time ago. Would the outcry have been quite as loud if the dismissal had taken place in November, when they were bottom of the league having lost all but two games? So which run was Southampton's true form? Cortese clearly decided he couldn't risk it being the first. Presumably Cortese made his decision, then waited for his chosen replacement to be ready. More pertinently for Southampton, it might be that Adkins simply wasn't a good fit for how Cortese wanted to run the club. Ever since Cortese and the Liebherr family arrived in 2009, they have spoken about a defined structure at the club, echoing the way many top European clubs are run. Specifically, that all teams from the kids right through to the seniors play broadly in the same way, and with the same formation - in this case, variants of a 4-3-3. This implementation of what Brendan Rodgers would call a 'philosophy' is basically a mirror of how Swansea have operated in recent years. Rodgers' old club have been praised by many for the structure of their club, ensuring that even though they have changed managers more frequently than many clubs in recent years, the team has played in much the same way. In such a system, the manager/head coach is of course important, but changeable. It's a protective measure too - if, as happened with Roberto Martinez and Rodgers, a manager is lured away by a bigger club, the upheaval to the team is kept to a minimum. This is what Cortese is trying to do at Southampton. Les Reed (former FA technical director and briefly Charlton manager) is head of football development at Southampton. He told The Daily Telegraph before promotion was confirmed last season: ""We want to win matches by keeping the ball on the ground and therefore we have to develop players who can do that. The parents understand it, they enjoy it, they want their kids to be playing a good style of football and hopefully over time that becomes the culture of the club."" The 'Southampton way' is something that Cortese has preached since his arrival - all part of his five-year plan to reach the top flight, delivered two years early. The club looked at how the best clubs in the world operated and implemented the best of what they saw. Simple, really. ""The main thing was not to look at how they did it to copy something but just to learn from what actually they wouldn't do again,"" said Cortese in The Telegraph. ""It was also analysing what didn't work and based on that we kept on developing our ideas."" So was Adkins adhering to this policy? As this excellent Southampton fan's blog notes, possibly not, given the way he mucked around with Southampton's system this season, flitting between a 4-2-3-1 that appears to suit the club's better players, and a 4-4-2 that, well, doesn't really. His team selection was also erratic and unpredictable, examples being the occasional dropping of top scorer Lambert and the selection of 17-year-old James Ward-Prowse for his first-team debut against Manchester City on the opening weekend. Ward-Prowse has made three starts since. And perhaps, no matter how well Adkins was doing, Cortese simply believes he has a better man in Pochettino. For a start, whether the idea is palatable or not, a progressive young Argentinean is more likely to attract players of Gaston Ramirez's calibre than a former physio from Birkenhead. Thanks to Cortese and the Liebherr family, Southampton can afford these talents, but now perhaps have a coach to match the money. In addition, Pochettino is highly rated in Spain. While Espanyol were bottom of La Liga when he left earlier this season, the sense was that he had simply run out of steam, after keeping a club with crippling financial problems (problems that meant they were consistently forced to sell players like Pablo Osvaldo and Jose Callejon) steady for nearly four years. If that doesn't sound like a huge amount of time, at the time of his sacking he was the longest-serving manager in la Primera by some way - it's pretty damn hard to stay in any job in Spain for longer than three years. Look at Pep Guardiola's hairline. He may simply be more suited to Cortese's 'Southampton way' than Adkins. Indeed, when welcoming their new manager, Cortese said Pochettino ""shares my belief that the most successful clubs are built by nurturing young players through a development system that provides a clear path to the first team"". Because of the constant sale of stars at Espanyol, he was forced to field youth-teamers, and did pretty well with them under the circumstances. Bearing in mind Espanyol's city neighbours would naturally hoover up the majority of the top local talent, finishes of 11th, eighth and 14th with second-tier kids is rather impressive. With the club in a better position to hold onto the products of a prolific academy now than when Theo Walcott, Gareth Bale and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain emerged, Pochettino could be the man to mould these prospects into a competitive team. Managerial decisions are these days made with long-term ambitions in mind. That's why replacing Harry Redknapp with Andre Villas-Boas made sense at Spurs even after they finished fourth last season. Adkins did a fine job at Southampton, but Cortese clearly believed that another man was better suited to the club's future. This might not work - it might turn out that Adkins should have been kept and Pochettino may be a horrible disaster. But the decision isn't illogical. It's cold, it's callous, it might instinctively feel wrong and Adkins should rightly have our sympathy, but Cortese's actions are not inexplicable. In fact, they're all part of the plan.",Raw Data
831,"The Chicago Bulls have performed admirably in the first half of this season without star point guard Derrick Rose. A second straight absence from leading scorer Luol Deng also didn't affect the team too much last time out. With Deng's status unknown, the Bulls will seek their fifth win in six games Wednesday night by adding to their dominance of the Detroit Pistons. Heading into the midway point of this season, Chicago (24-16) is in fifth place in the Eastern Conference despite not having Rose on the floor due to a torn ACL. The 2010-11 MVP took the ""next step"" in his rehab Tuesday by taking contact in scrimmages against teammates. ""We want him to concentrate on the rehab and the team to continue to concentrate on improvement and our next opponent,"" Thibodeau said. Deng, meanwhile, has missed the past two games with a strained right hamstring but the Bulls pulled away in the fourth quarter Monday for a 95-83 home win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Kirk Hinrich had a season-best 22 points to help Chicago bounce back from an overtime defeat to Memphis in Saturday's opener of a four-game homestand. Joakim Noah had 13 rebounds, a season-high six blocks and six points after being benched for the final 22:53 in the loss to the Grizzlies. Jimmy Butler had 10 points, eight rebounds and helped hold Kobe Bryant to 7-of-22 shooting in his second straight start in place of Deng. ""It's a great win but it's on to the next one,"" Butler said. ""We never want to lose any games, two games in a row or any game at home."" The Bulls haven't lost to the Pistons (16-25) since Dec. 23, 2008, having won the past 16 matchups. That's tied for the league's second-longest active streak against one opponent. Chicago has also won 12 consecutive regular-season matchups at the United Center since a 95-87 loss on Feb. 24, 2006. The Bulls lost twice at home to Detroit during a six-game defeat in the 2007 East semifinals. Chicago, though, wasn't exactly dominant in the early going in the only matchup with the Pistons this season on Dec. 7. The Bulls trailed by as many as 17 in the second quarter but rallied for a 108-104 road victory with Noah providing career highs of 30 points and 23 rebounds. Carlos Boozer contributed 24 points and heads into this game averaging 22.0 during Chicago's 8-3 start to the new year. He also has 11 of his conference-best 23 double-doubles over his last 13 contests. In his three seasons with the Bulls, Boozer is averaging 21.8 points on 62.3 percent shooting in eight games against the Pistons, his best scoring performance versus any team in that span. Detroit enters this matchup having won back-to-back games after dropping three of four. Brandon Knight led six players in double figures with 18 points in Tuesday's 105-90 victory in Orlando, and Rodney Stuckey had 14 after being held to single digits in four straight contests. ""We know that if we play with a lot of fight and a lot of effort every game, we'll get some great wins,"" said rookie Andre Drummond, who is averaging 12.7 points and 9.3 rebounds in his last three games. ""We weren't trying to do anything fancy. We were just finishing plays."" Stuckey had a season-high 24 points in the loss to Chicago in December, and 32 in a 100-94 overtime defeat to the Bulls in Detroit on April 15.",Raw Data
832,"After winning two Grand Slams last summer, Serena Williams already felt like the number one player in the world to most of us. However, it was not until this week that the rankings caught up to popular opinion. With her performance in Doha, Serena replaces Victoria Azarenka as world number one and at age 31 is the oldest woman to do so. It just seemed like an adventure to get there. The roller coaster rankings have underlined the womens game for nearly half a decade. Since Justine Henin announced her sudden retirement in the spring of 2008, the WTA has seen constant upheaval at the top of the rankings. There have been 18 different reigns at number one spread amongst eight women. To contrast, the mens game has seen three such players be number one in that time. In the 37 year history of the WTA rankings, there have only been 21 women who have held the position but a surprising eight in the last five years alone. I will attempt to rank these women on a scale of most deserving to least deserving of the title of worlds best at that time. This ranking is only to assess the players at the time just before and during their reign and not over their entire careers. 1. Serena Williams (No. 1: Sep. 2008; Total 66 weeks and counting) Serena is an easy choice as the most deserving number one when she reaches the peak. Her limited schedule means that it is the strong results in the grand slams that make up most of her ranking points. Both her runs have consisted of grand slam victories that have seen her impressive total rise to 15. 2. Kim Clijsters (No.1: Feb. 2011; Total 1 week) This may seem odd to put Kim so high with only one week at top in the last five years. However, when Kim returned after her first retirement and the birth of her daughter, she exceeded all expectations. She became the best hardcourt player on the tour for nearly two years and won three grand slams in a period of 16 months. Kim with daughter, Jada after winning the US Open. Image courtesy guardian.co.uk. 3. Victoria Azarenka (No.1: Jan. 2012; Total 51 weeks) Azarenka belongs this high on the list because her reign has been punctuated with big tournament wins. These include two Australian Opens in 12 and 13 to go with a runner up in the 12 US Open. Despite her often criticized on-court tactics, Azarenka proved to be a worthy number one and a player we will see return to that position soon. 4. Maria Sharapova (No.1: Apr. 2008; Total 7 weeks) I would never rank Maria below Victoria Azarenka in an all-time greats list but it is justified here. She took over briefly after Henin retired and then in 2012 for four more weeks. However, her tenure came after many finals appearances and the completion of her Career Grand Slam in Paris. To me that cements her place ahead of others on this list. 5. Caroline Wozniacki (No.1: Oct. 2010; Total 67 weeks) She has held the number one spot for the longest period in the last five years including almost the entire 2011 season. Wozniacki was a counter-pucher who succeeded in many mid-tier tournaments but could not win the big one (losing in the US Open final to Kim Clijsters). However, her 12 victories over 2010 and 2011 put her near the middle of the pack of recent world number ones. 6. Ana Ivanovic (No.1: Jun. 2008; Total 12 weeks) The Serbian took over world number one after her breakthrough on the clay in Paris. She defeated Dinara Safina in straight sets and filled the void left by Henin. The rest of her year would be riddled with poor performances and injuries but her grand slam during the reign propels her ahead of Safina and Jankovic. 7. Jelena Jankovic (No. 1: Aug. 2008; Total 18 weeks) Taking over for one week in August , Jankovic was another player to ascend to number one without having won a grand slam. She was a US Open finalist and the winner of three consecutive fall events during her 17 week run in late 2008, A player who never had one defining aspect to her game continues to grind weekly on the WTA tour. Dinara and Marat are the first siblings to become number one in the world. Image courtesy of Telegraph. 8. Dinara Safina (No.1: Apr. 2009; Total 26 weeks) The never retired Safina took over in April 2009 without winning a grand slam. She was coming of a crushing loss in the Australian Open final to Serena and would be made aware of that numerous times. Safina had a strong Spring that included a title in Madrid and a finals at Roland Garros. It would be the early exits at Wimbledon and the US Open series that defined a lackluster tenure. (Note: Weeks at No.1 inclusive of April 2008 to February 2013) Do you agree? Would Safina be the most out of place number one in the past five years?",Raw Data
833,"FORMULA ONE supremo Bernie Ecclestone is past it, is too old, is too bossy and should quit. That is the opinion of Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo, who has taken another swipe at ­Ecclestone, 82, who has been F1s ringmaster for nearly 40 years. Di Montezemolo said: The era of the one-man show cannot continue. It is finished. The Ferrari chief failed to praise Ecclestone for masterminding F1s huge expansion in the last few years and instead said: Godfathers no longer exist  at least not in Formula One. Ecclestone, who is worth an estimated £1.75billion, is under investigation for allegedly offering a £25m bribe to a German banker to push through the sale of grand prix racing to CVC, the equity firm he represents, back in 2006. But Ecclestone said: I would be worried if I was guilty  but Im not. Di Montezemolo, though, says Ecclestones denial of any wrongdoing does not make any difference as to whether he should stay in charge or not. The outburst from the Italian stems from a spat with Ecclestone, when the Englishman called Ferraris protest after the final race of last season, when Sebastian Vettel claimed his third world championship, a joke. And Di Montezemolo, 65, added: My father always taught me that you have to respect your elders. So I will stop there. His hints that Ecclestone should step aside did not impress the billionaire, who said: Me quit voluntarily? Thats a non-starter. Despite what anybody might say or wish, the only way I am going to leave this job is if I get a call from the good Lord and he wants me up there.",Raw Data
834,"Former England manager Steve McClaren has been sacked by German giants Wolfsburg, ending a disappointing eight-month reign in charge of the former Bundesliga champions. ""VfL have parted ways with Steve McClaren,"" the club said in a statement. ""Pierre Littbarski is taking over."" ""We were not convinced any more that we could work with Steve McClaren in a solid way until the end of the season,"" Wolfsburg general manager Dieter Hoeness said. McClaren joined the Volkswagen-backed team in the summer, weeks after leading Dutch minnows FC Twente to a surprise Eredivisie title. He has only won five of 21 Bundesliga matches and a 1-0 defeat at Hannover appears to have been the last straw, coming four games after a vote of confidence for the former Middlesbrough manager. The club lies 12th in the 18-team Bundesliga, one point above the relegation play-off places. The 2009 champions' latest disappointment came after Brazil midfielder Diego defied team orders by taking a penalty, which he subsequently missed. The drama added to the belief that McClaren works better with younger, lesser-known players and that he struggles to man-manage top internationals. In addition to his unprecedented success with Twente, McClaren won the League Cup with Middlesbrough, who he then took to the UEFA Cup final, where they were beaten by Sevilla. But afterwards he struggled as England manager, failing to qualify for Euro 2008 and replaced by Fabio Capello soon afterwards. McClaren kept his job at Wolfsburg in January, despite coming under mounting pressure for poor results, with fans initially blaming the board for not adding enough top players to the squad in the summer. Recent weeks, however, saw fans protest against McClaren, with the poor run continuing despite January signings Patrick Helmes, Tuncay, Koo Ja-cheol and Yohandry Orozco compensating for the sale of Edin Dzeko to Manchester City.",Raw Data
835,"The long, arduous journey that was the fantasy football season came to an end as we waved goodbye to the 2012 calendar year. We watched a very strange, topsy-turvy campaign that included myriad injuries, confusing performance trends and the disappearances of many former stars. Of course, we’ve already had one huge injury in the postseason that served to shake up those early 2013 fantasy draft boards. So, we can’t put the spreadsheets away altogether. (You weren’t leaving football behind anyway.) Soon, we’ll start inundating you with fantastic statistical breakdowns on the diamond. Pitchers and catchers are just a few short weeks from reporting to Arizona and Florida. Before we do, I wanted to put a few thoughts out about the rookie class of 2012 and offer some names for late wide receiver slots on your draft board. It’s my way of celebrating the brilliance of “All-Name Team” captain and fantasy hero Cecil Shorts III. The results from the Wild Round of the NFL Playoffs took a backseat to a monumental injury in Washington. On Wednesday, January 9th, Robert Griffin III underwent surgery to repair the LCL and ACL in his right knee (his second ACL repair). Evidently, there was no clear ACL damage on the early MRIs, but it required repair once Dr. James Andrews further assessed the damage during surgery. As a result, the compound damage extends the timeline for Griffin III’s return to the field. You can hope for the Adrian Peterson-inspired return from RGIII in 2013. I will give Mike Shanahan credit for securing a second option in the 2012 NFL Draft. Kirk Cousins slides into the starter role during Griffin III’s absence and becomes a mid-QB2 fantasy option. Remember, Cousins led the Redskins to a victory in Week 15 over the Browns, completing 26-of-37 attempts for 329 yards with two touchdowns and an interception (two sacks and 22 rushing yards). With a healthy Pierre Garcon, the return of Fred Davis and a strong running game onboard, Cousins should succeed in the top spot. Andrew Luck led the Colts into the playoffs after passing for over 4,300 yards in the regular season. Granted, he closed out the regular season by passing for 205 passing yards or less in four consecutive games and failed to complete more than 50% of his pass attempts in his final five regular season games. He did have record six 300-yard games. Luck exceeded expectations, registering 28 total touchdowns against 23 turnovers in what was expected to be a dismal rookie season. There is a talented nucleus in the passing game, including two tight ends, though the team will need to find a complement to Vick Ballard in the backfield. Luck will enter 2013 drafts as a mid-QB1 option. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. I remember the calls for Russell Wilson to be benched following the first quarter of the season despite recording victories over the Cowboys and Packers. Wilson’s second half of the season made him one of the great stories of the 2012 season. The rookie from Wisconsin produced multiple touchdowns in eight of his final nine starts and he became a rushing threat. Wilson will eventually work the ball downfield more frequently, but this squad is built to run the ball and play suffocating defense. In 2012, Wilson attempted more than 25 passes in only five games. He’ll retain a mid-QB2 rank heading into draft season with upside. Ryan Tannehill finished a distant fourth in the rookie quarterback sweepstakes this season, but the Dolphins found their signal-caller for the future. Tannehill passed for nearly 3,300 yards despite injury and consistency issues in the receiving corps. Of course, Tannehill did pass for 200 yards or less in seven games that he finished (three with more than 250 yards). He threw 12 touchdown passes against 13 interceptions. With upgrades to the receiving corps via the draft or free agency, Tannehill should round into a more consistent performer. Still, he’s just a borderline back-end QB2 on the early draft board. Chip Kelly reportedly talked about Colt McCoy as a viable option for the Browns during his short-lived flirtation with the squad. I don’t see how Brandon Weeden was dismissed so quickly after passing for nearly 3,400 yards (3,385) with 14 touchdowns against 17 interceptions (he missed the finale). There’s a very nice core in Cleveland with Trent Richardson, speedster Josh Gordon and Greg Little. As this was written, the Eagles were still pushing through the interview process for the head coaching job. The team will reportedly move forward without Michael Vick, thereby putting Nick Foles into the top spot. Foles passed for 1,699 yards while completing nearly 61% of his pass attempts in seven games. The Philadelphia offense is stocked with speed options and big-time playmakers. Foles will be able to thrive, provided that the team is able to build a serviceable offensive line this offseason. He’s a second-line QB2 out of the gate. Second-Year Performers While we lament the decision to leave RGIII on the field and his subsequent surgery, we must applaud Mike and Kyle Shanahan for leaving the running back shuffle in the past. Alfred Morris amassed 1,613 rushing yards overall with 13 touchdowns and dominated opponents down the stretch. He rushed for more than 76 yards in all but two games this season and carried the ball at least 20 times in seven consecutive games to close out 2012. I still fear Shanahan turning back to his old ways in 2013, particularly with RGIII’s injury on the board. Still, Morris will be a mid-RB1 entering 2013 fantasy drafts. Doug Martin produced a fantastic season for the Buccaneers despite obvious issues on the offensive line and defensive lapses that forced Josh Freeman to take to the air. Martin earned five 100-yard games this season and helped bolster his stats by availing himself as a receiver (49 receptions for 472 yards). If you can spin Martin’s stats well to your league mates, you may find yourself a bargain on draft day. He rushed for 62 yards or fewer on six occasions, including four of his final six games. Trent Richardson finished third among rookie running backs, producing 1,267 yards with 11 total touchdowns. Richardson achieved three 100-yard games and was limited to fewer than 50 rushing yards on seven occasions before missing the finale because of ankle/rib injuries. Richardson reportedly played much of the 2012 season with broken ribs. He’ll appear on the board as a high-RB2 option for 2013. Ronnie Hillman was expected to become “the man” when Willis McGahee was injured midway through the 2012 season. Instead, Knowshon Moreno emerged from nowhere to claim the top slot and produced fantastic numbers to help fuel the 11-game winning streak. Hillman produced 330 rushing yards on 85 attempts this season (3.9 yards per carry). I’m not ready to bury him yet, but the team will certainly have some interesting decisions to make at the position. He’s worthy of a late-round flier given the current roster composition with upside. Daryl Richardson earned the second slot in the St. Louis backfield behind Steven Jackson and amassed more than 600 total yards. He’ll be challenged in 2013 by Isaiah Pead, who slid off the radar after being selected in the second round. Pead logged only 10 carries in 2012, five of which came in the season finale against Seattle. I expect Pead to slide ahead on the depth chart and become a formidable No. 2 behind Jackson. Dwayne Allen and Coby Fleener will grow alongside Andrew Luck in Indianapolis. Allen caught 45-of-66 targets for 521 yards, though he logged only three touchdowns. Fleener caught 26-of-48 and missed part of the season because of a shoulder injury. Allen is the more intriguing option for me in fantasyland as a potential red zone beast. I’ll spare the lengthy analysis of Alshon Jeffery and Kendall Wright here. Both flashed signs of becoming big-time performers in 2012. Jeffery had his rookie season upended by injury, while Wright battled a crowded receiving corps and inconsistent quarterback play. Likewise, Chris Givens amassed 42 receptions and demonstrated great downfield play-making ability for Sam Bradford. The Rams will be interesting to watch in year two for Jeff Fisher. Jarius Wright closed out the season well, producing eight receptions (14 targets) for 143 yards in the final two games against the Texans and Packers. He amassed 22 receptions for 310 yards overall, including a huge 65-yard touchdown reception against Green Bay. Wright will take on a much larger role in his second year whether Percy Harvin returns to Minnesota or not. Obviously, there’s still a huge question at quarterback (are you a Ponder believer?), but there’s speed and downfield capability here. Unless there’s a complete overhaul in New York, you won’t have to take much of a risk in selecting Stephen Hill late in your 2013 drafts. He produced 21 receptions on 47 targets as a rookie for 2512 yards, though he did missed five games. Looking Deep: Next Year’s Cecil Shorts III Tandon Doss will enter his third year with the Ravens in 2013, and he’s been tabbed as a potential replacement for Anquan Boldin. Doss caught 7-of-17 targets in 2012 for 123 yards. He’s a 6-foot-2 receiver who logged 140 receptions for 1,668 yards in his final two seasons at Indiana. The Texans continue their search for a No. 2 receiving option opposite Andre Johnson. Sure, Owen Daniels has been a steady option over the middle with an occasional deep throw in the mix, but there’s not a steady downfield option otherwise (it’s no longer Kevin Walter’s run). Keshawn Martin, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State, caught 10 passes for 85 yards while operating as a return man for the Texans in 2012. DeVier Posey, a third-round pick out of Ohio State, caught six passes for 87 yards. Posey is the better bet for a larger role coming into 2013 barring a change in personnel via the draft or free agency. Longtime readers already know of my affinity for Mohamed Sanu, who established himself as a red zone option down the stretch before an injury sidelined him ahead of the playoffs. Teammate Marvin Jones, a rookie from California, will compete for a starting slot in 2013. Jones caught 18-of-32 targets in 2012, including 10 receptions (his lone touchdown) in the final two weeks of the regular season. The Browns have an intriguing core of skill position players entering 2013. I can’t believe that I just wrote that line, but it’s true. We know about T-Rich and the short-lived fantasy brilliance of Josh Gordon as a downfield threat. I’ll turn my attention to another receiving option that popped onto the radar as a rookie. Travis Benjamin, a fourth-round pick from Miami, caught 18-of-37 targets for 298 yards with two touchdowns and demonstrated some big-play potential of his own. I’ll be curious to see how he’s used once the new coaching staff gets put in place. Could he pile up short receptions with some YAC? Benjamin’s a true longshot option in this category. Rishard Matthews received an opportunity down the stretch in Miami because of an injury to Davone Bess. The rookie from Nevada caught eight passes in the final three games for 96 yards, including 20 and 30-yard receptions. Matthews finished the season with 11 receptions on 20 targets for 151 yards. Nick Toon missed the entire 2012 season after undergoing surgery on his foot. He’ll return to the Saints for 2013 barring a setback and will try to crack the rotation in the explosive New Orleans offense. A.J. Jenkins was a non-factor as a rookie despite getting selected in the first round of the NFL Draft by the 49ers. Jenkins was not targeted a single time this season. Michael Crabtree finally became the No. 1 option that everyone anticipated he could be, but questions remain in the rest of the San Francisco receiving corps. He’ll have a chance to battle Mario Manningham for reps in 2013. And because I feel the need to put his sticker on the board, don’t forget about Vincent Brown of the Chargers. We were taunted and teased during the middle of the 2012 season about a possible return to action for Brown. Unfortunately, it did not materialize. With Danario Alexander working alongside Malcom Floyd on the perimeter, Brown should return as a PPR machine for the Chargers in 2013.",Raw Data
836,"Welcome to New York, new Jets general manager John Idzik. Your first job? Trade Tim Tebow for something more than peanuts. Your second job? Try to understand the circus that is the New York Jets. While it’s no secret that the Jets are interested in moving on from quarterbacks Mark Sanchez and Tebow, what has been interesting this offseason is how they’re trying to go about it. First came reports that the Jets want to ditch Sanchez, but are looking for someone like journeyman Tarvaris Jackson to take his place. (In the Jets’ defense, they have very little salary-cap room available.) Now, in trying to find a buyer for Tebow, who was badly misused in the Jets’ system during the season, the team looks like it’s pinning the entire situation on fired GM Mike Tannenbaum in hopes of saving face. While it has been widely believed that owner Woody Johnson brought Tebow to New York in some kind of publicity ploy, Rich Cimini of ESPN reports that the Jets now say that Johnson was not behind the controversial trade. “Former Broncos general manager Ted Sundquist . . . said Johnson told him it wasn’t his idea,” Cimini writes. “According to Sundquist, Johnson said the trade was ‘forced’ on them — meaning him and team president Neil Glat, who also participated in [Sundqist's interview to be the Jets' next general manager]. That makes it sound like Johnson was blaming former general manager Mike Tannenbaum for the Tebow debacle. In a sense, Johnson did exactly that, firing Tannenbaum. Johnson also said, according to Sundquist, that he eventually ‘jumped on board’ with the idea, deferring to his football people.” Looking for more scoops on your favorite New England sports teams? Check out NESN. Now Idzik’s first job is to drum up interest for Tebow, so the Jets can get at least a little help back when he is traded away. Cimini says the Jets “are expected to part ways with Tebow next month.” While Idzik has been praised in football circles and could be a solid choice to turn the Jets around, it’s never about cap space, player talent or in-game strategy in New York. The biggest part of that job will always be handling egos, media attention and the fickle interests of ownership and fans alike. In that role, Idzik has his hands full, no matter what happens with Sanchez and Tebow.",Raw Data
837,"ARLINGTON, Texas The Eagles and Cowboys had been hurtling down their own bumpy paths toward a primetime date for a while, finally colliding Sunday at the crossroads of crushing disappointment and wildly overrated. If we are being honest, it felt more like a game of ""incompetence chicken"" than an NFL contest. Eagles: We fumbled away a chance to win. Cowboys: You think that is bad? We gave up a 98-yard kickoff return in the final minute to give y'all a chance. Eagles: Well, our coach is so bleeping fired. Cowboys: So is ours. Well, he likely is. If the Cowboys had lost Sunday, coach Jason Garrett almost certainly loses his job at season's end and possibly sooner. Why he lives to coach another day is a 38-33 victory against a broken and deflated Eagles team that was more fortuitous than deserved. And I find this confounding. How can beating Philly save anything? Whether The Redheaded Genius deserves more time to fix this Cowboys mess is debatable. Settling this debate, even momentarily, on a victory against a team as flawed as Philly is ludicrous. My media cohorts were all planning on writing ""fire Jason"" columns until Dallas did what just about every team that played Andy Reid and his train wreck Eagles team this season has done: Beat them. JG absolutely needs to be fired. Unless he get Dallas to the playoffs. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones actually perfectly summarized my argument, accidentally, when he talked about what this victory actually means. Hint: The answer is nothing. It saves nothing. It guarantees nothing. It's ability to do either is contingent on what happens going forward. ""I'm very hopeful but I am also realistic,"" Jones said. ""I like to think it might be (a turning point) for this season but only if these guys make it that and we ought to take these four games and say we got an opportunity. Let's get in here and dedicate ourselves."" Because as the Cowboys players and Jerry talked honestly about before this season, their window is closing. They have an aging nucleus that despite astronomic yearly expectations has produced a big bag of nothing. They are, I daresay, very much like this Eagles team. Dallas has been as consistently hope-inspiring and ultimately disappointing as Philly in the time of coach Andy Reid. There is just not the focal point for that massive fail in Dallas like Philly because the Cowboys change coaches every four years or so. The reality is both of these teams have been going at this for a while with a nucleus with only heartbreak and a raging case of disappointment to show for all of that promise. The Eagles have done all of their disappointing under Reid, the Cowboys under a collaboration of Chan Gailey, Dave Campo, Bill Parcells, Coach Cupcake and now Garrett. So this whole idea that somehow the Eagles need to make change while the Cowboys need to stay the course is missing the point. One coach, many coaches does not matter. Neither team has been able to turn all of that talent into a championship. Are you surprised that "" we're still in it?"" Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo said, finishing what he thought was the question. It was not my question but a legitimate point. It is a little surprising that the Cowboys have playoff hope despite being 6-6 and losing badly to Washington on Thanksgiving. It is a long shot but a shot nonetheless. It may be their last shot as presently comprised. Just as Philly has finally determined that they can not plug on endlessly with Reid and Donovan McNabb and now Reid and Mike Vick, Jerry Jones eventually will determine this cannot abide no matter how much hope Romo, Jason Witten, DeMarcus Ware, et al, provoke. The league is not about hope. It is about championships. My question to Romo as we walked after his press conference was more about whether he was surprised that after this many years with such a talented team, years that culminated Sunday with him breaking Troy Aikman's touchdown record that he did not have a championship. ""No,"" he said. ""It's hard. There is a lot of good players, a lot of good teams. There are no guarantees in life and in football. That is why you do everything you can so at the end of the day you know when it is all said and done you gave it your all."" There is no doubt Romo has given this his all. Guys like Witten and Ware have as well. There comes a point where this is not enough. They have reached this point in Philly. Reid lost his job long ago, somewhere between when his faith in Vick proved unwarranted and that point where Eagles types had lost faith in his faith. So he almost surely will be jettisoned at season's end a long with a good hunk of this nucleus. Nor would a victory Sunday have had any bearing on this. The Cowboys would be wise to follow that lead, the only exception being if they reach the playoffs. If so, they can say they saved JG's job. Until then, the first thought was the wise one. He is so bleeping fired because this cannot abide.",Raw Data
838,"If the Heisman Trophy people are to be taken at their word, that their award ""annually recognizes the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity,"" the kid known as ""Johnny Football"" has to be the choice. Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel, as he was known before the nickname stuck, is a transformative player. If you take him off the ninth-ranked Aggies, they are not the same. Their transition into the Southeastern Conference is less steady, their decision to secede from the Big 12 more second-guessable, their season less exciting. Manziel made it impossible to tell the tale of this college season without him. The problem is logic and awards have only a casual relationship. Voters screw these things up often and for reasons like ""we usually do not do that"" and ""you see, Johnny Football is a freshman,"" and this may cost Manziel the Heisman. I know, I know, people are saying he is the prohibitive favorite to win the award. I hope so. He should be, based on his 4,600 total yards in 12 games and his hand in 43 touchdowns, and how he has played the game, all sandlot style, and how he improved every single week, and how his team got better with him and that victory against then-No. 1 Alabama. ""This season has been incredibly surreal and beyond my wildest imagination,"" said Manziel in a conference call with reporters Monday, the national media's first exposure to him beyond what we saw on Saturdays and in a few leaked Halloween photos. He was just as charming as everybody figured he'd be. Funny, too. There was a feeling of ""Why the hell has A&M been hiding this kid?"" and ""Of course, he is going to win the Heisman now."" Why he would not are really non-reasons such as: 1. Johnny Football's team has been defeated (by LSU and Florida) unlike 12-0 Notre Dame. This is ridiculous because the Heisman is not a team achievement award. 2. He is a freshman. Also ridiculous because the Heisman is not a lifetime achievement award. 3. Voters tend to do crazy things. And this is most definitely true. The problem with arguing for a player to win an award is the supposition that you are arguing against another. This fallacy that to be for one, you must be against the other guy was at play in this year's American League MVP voting, where support for Los Angeles Angels wunderkind Mike Trout somehow morphed into Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera's winning being an embarrassment. I would have voted for Trout, but thought much the same way I do when pressed on the merits of Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o for Heisman: He'd be a good choice as well. There is no argument against Te'o per se, merely a stronger one for Johnny Football. Nor is this simply about legend, though I, too, became more enamored with him after pictures of him in a Scooby Doo costume, with a giant grin and sorority girls in all stages of dress on Halloween leaked. This seemed very much what a college quarterback should be doing in his free time. The problem with legends is they tend to be based on this weird mix of amazing things they actually do and these narratives we add. This was even more the case with Johnny Football because A&M coach Kevin Sumlin prohibited him from talking to the media this season under the guise of protecting him. There is a whole argument to be made about this, about whether college football is meant to protect kids or educate them, whether they should be shielded or exposed. This is not that argument. The problem I have is this set up a perfect storm for sports journalists. There is nothing we like better than a blank canvas to insert our beliefs, our thoughts, our hope of what the kid is like without anything to challenge it. This is the genesis of legends. It is also the danger. I actually liked the kid we talked to more. He is not necessarily a throwback or really that different. It is funny how much he sounds like so many kids I talked to on Friday nights, on varying fields all over Texas. In fact, his answer about his nickname is exactly like what a kid from East Texas would say. ""My feeling is it's something that's funny,"" Manziel said. Why is it funny? ""Well, my name is Johnny, and I've been playing football since I was 6."" All of this is fun and makes for a great story, a legend if you will. Why he deserves to win the Heisman, though, really has little to do with any of it. Why is simple. Johnny Football is the most outstanding college football player in the country, and his legend was built Saturday after Saturday by what he did on the field.",Raw Data
839,"If this were the NCAA, the Los Angeles Lakers would be ruled academically ineligible. That's how bad their season has been. But, in going over NBA bylaws, no team can be barred for flunking in a season. Sometimes, as students of tanking know, it actually can help. But it would figure that in this disastrous year, the Lakers don't even have their 2013 first-round pick; they gave it to Phoenix in the trade for Steve Nash. OK, so the suspense is gone about the Lakers. If you want to see their grade for the first half of the season, keep scrolling. And scrolling. And scrolling. Let it be known this professor grades on a curve. So this midseason report card takes into consideration expectations teams had entering the season: HEAD OF THE CLASS Los Angeles Clippers (A): The Clippers were supposed to be the other team from Los Angeles, but have flirted all season with the NBA's best record. Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are All-Stars. And the Clippers have won despite largely being without two old guys who remember when tests came off a ditto machine: Grant Hill and Chauncey Billups. Oklahoma City (A): Kevin Durant is on pace to win his fourth straight scoring title. The only guys in history to have won that many in a row are Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan, who each won seven straight. Three months after dealing a guy who wanted more shots and more money, they're saying in OKC, ""James who?"" San Antonio (A): The Spurs still make the honor roll even though four of their top players (Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker and Danny Green) were allowed to ditch school. That's when coach Gregg Popovich sent them home to rest before a game at Miami and the Spurs got a $250,000 fine. If you're still waiting for the Spurs to get old, cobwebs are growing on you. Golden State (A): Everybody keeps waiting for the Warriors to make like origami (that's fold), but it hasn't happened. Now, we'll see if the Warriors can end the Sprewell Curse with Stephen Curry or David Lee. They haven't had an All-Star since Latrell Sprewell made it in February 1997 before choking then-coach P.J. Carlesimo 10 months later. New York (A-): The Carmelo Anthony-led Knicks would have gotten an A had it not been for Amar'e Stoudemire possibly starting to mess up things. New York is 6-6 since the now-plodding big guy returned from a knee injury, dropping its record from 21-9 to 27-15. At least no fire extinguishers have been harmed since his return. Memphis (A-): The Grizzlies' flagpole-thin bench got candlestick-thin when they traded Marreese Speights. But if shedding salary in a deal with Cleveland helps them keep Rudy Gay and Zach Randolph, it's worth it. Chicago (B+): The Bulls have a history of surviving without star players. They somehow won 55 games in 1993-94, the first season after Jordan's first retirement. Now, they're getting by without another former MVP, Derrick Rose, who is out until after the All-Star break following knee surgery. The way these Bulls are playing, Rose could even go play a little baseball before he returns. Well, maybe not. Brooklyn (B+): Carlesimo is now putting a chokehold on foes since taking over last month from the fired Avery Johnson. Carlesimo gets an A+ for his 11-2 record. But it must be taken into consideration that Johnson went 14-14 before Russian owner Mikhail Prokhorov exiled him to Siberia. Indiana (B+): The Pacers are on pace to win 50 for the first time in nine years. Then again, last-year's 42-24 mark in the lockout-shortened season was the equivalent of 52. Indiana's team play has to make Hoosiers legends Bob Knight and Gene Hackman quite proud. Miami (B): The Heat might have a narrow lead for the best record in the East, but players not named LeBron James having been taking too many in-game siestas. The defending champions, who were expected to easily win the East should be turning in graduate-school work. We'll see how they do on the final. Or, make that, the Finals. That is, if they don't fall asleep and miss them. Denver (B): The Nuggets are heading toward their usual 50-win season and first-round playoff exit in the rugged West. But their 27-18 record is nothing to complain about since they stayed afloat despite playing a staggering 17 of their first 23 games away from the comfortable Pepsi Center. JUST GETTING BY Portland (B-): This young, rebuilding team would seem to have no business being around .500. But the Trail Blazers struck it rich by drafting Damian Lillard with the sixth pick in the first round. He might already be the second-most illustrious Weber State alum. It's tough to top J. Willard Marriott, who founded hotels in which the Trail Blazers sometimes stay. Milwaukee (B-): The Bucks already dumped coach Scott Skiles in favor of assistant Jim Boylan. But 23-19 isn't bad considering expectations hardly were high. This is a team with just one winning season in the previous nine years. Utah (B-): Tyrone Corbin has a record under .500 since taking over for Jerry Sloan in February 2011. Not a great way to follow a legend who didn't exactly leave the cupboard bare. Making matters worse for Corbin, the legend is still around. He attends some Jazz games. Atlanta (B-): Larry Drew did one of the worst things a coach in the final year of his contract can do: Artificially raise expectations. Even though the Hawks weren't all that great, they started out 19-9. Since then, they're 6-10. That is not good news for Drew. Houston (C+): The Rockets were a .500 team without James Harden and they're a .500 team with him. Harden has increased his scoring average by nine points since balking at a Thunder contract offer and getting traded to Houston. But he can only hope his former teammates will be nice enough to leave tickets if he wants to watch some live NBA action in May and June. Minnesota (C+): The Timberwolves have been dribbling on thin ice all season due to injuries to Kevin Love and Ricky Rubio, but they haven't fallen in. Top-notch coach Rick Adelman has kept them within striking range of the playoffs even though they have slumped lately after Love broke his hand a second time. New Orleans (C): Rookie Anthony Davis has brought excitement back to the Hornets, who have won six of 10. When rookie Austin Rivers helped his Hornets to a victory over Boston and daddy coach Doc Rivers, he got some serious summer bragging rights. It almost doesn't matter what happens in the March rematch in New Orleans. Charlotte (C): Before you wonder how an 11-32 team can have this grade, consider the Bobcats are taking remedial courses. Their 7-59 mark last season set an NBA record for the lowest winning percentage. So winning 20 games would be a good season by Charlotte standards. DOG ATE THEIR HOMEWORK Boston (C-): Doc Rivers might even consider this grade too generous. After his team lost a third straight last week, he threatened trades and said, ""I'm clearly not doing my job with this team."" The job many thought he would do was challenge the Heat in the East. Dallas (C-): Continuing with the theme of underachieving former champions, one at least gets the feeling the Mavericks could turn it around. They won five of six in a recent stretch, the only loss in overtime to Oklahoma City. When Dirk Nowitzki recently barked about the team, it was like E.F. Hutton. People listened. Detroit (C-): The Detroit Edsels, er, Pistons are heading for a fifth straight losing season. At least with young guys Greg Monroe and Brandon Knight, they're showing a little improvement. Toronto (C-): Another bad team that is at least playing better than last season. But unless Amir Johnson is doing strange things, it's hard to remember the Raptors are still in the league. Sacramento (C-): The SuperSonics, er, Kings, at least have a chance to have the most wins in franchise history in a lame-duck season. They went 31-41 in their last season in Rochester in 1956-57, 30-52 in their final season in Cincinnati in 1971-72 and 31-51 in their last season in Kansas City in 1984-85. They're on pace now to win 31. Philadelphia (D+): Andrew Bynum has bowled more than played basketball this season. Still, there's no way a team that came within one game of the East finals last spring should be playing this poorly. Doug Collins is on pace to have the worst coaching season of his solid career. Orlando (D+): The Magic were expected to fall off after losing Dwight Howard. But by this much? At least they have something to play for the rest of the season. At 14-28, they're not far behind Howard's Lakers, and they're 1-0 this season against the departed one. Cleveland (D): Injuries aren't a valid excuse. Cleveland is 3-11 this season in games in which Kyrie Irving and Anderson Varejao both played. With Varejao now out for the season due to a blood clot, there's no hope at all. Phoenix (D): It's usually just spin doctoring when a team claims in a press release a coach has left due to a mutual parting. This time, it might be believable. The Suns are going nowhere and Alvin Gentry might have wanted no part of a team that has fallen apart since going to the West finals three years ago. Washington (D-): So how does a team with the NBA's worst record not get an F? Well, the Wizards have somehow beaten both Finals participants from last year in Miami and Oklahoma City. They are better since point guard John Wall came back from a knee injury. And the Lakers deserve their spot all by themselves. Los Angeles Lakers (F): So who needs to stay after classes during this mess to clean the erasers? How about the teacher himself? Mike D'Antoni is 14-20 since taking over as coach, and the Lakers (19-25) look lost. At least Kobe Bryant, who finally has joined Twitter, has a new forum to complain.",Raw Data
840,"There were people on the pitch and one of them was Andr Villas-Boas. Mousa Dembl's winning goal for Tottenham Hotspur had it all, and for his manager it was the prompt for a frenzied outpouring, which tipped him over the line and out of his technical area. If he could have done, he would surely have chased Demble down and jumped all over him. The game had looked up for Tottenham, despite a second-half rally which had built to a climax. Villas-Boas made bold substitutions and, by the end, attacking roles for his players were no more than guidelines. They roamed and they interchanged and they pressed for the solution. If there had been a kitchen sink handy, Villas-Boas would have thrown that on, too. Then Dembl seized possession. There was 30 seconds of the 90 minutes remaining and he was some way away but, with a dip of his shoulder, he slithered away from Clment Grenier, Lyon's outstanding player, to open up the shooting chance. Dembl's drive, left-footed and from fully 25 yards, was true and packed with power. The ball fizzed low into the far corner and sent everybody connected to Tottenham into raptures. Tottenham had been undermined by late concessions earlier in the season but Villas-Boas could reflect on a decisive turning of the tide. In the first leg at White Hart Lane Gareth Bale's second goal had come in stoppage time. The full-time whistle brought further passion from Villas-Boas and his staff and plenty of general cavorting. He won this trophy with Porto in 2011 and the elation was also to be cherished here. ""When you score in the last minute, especially with a goal that brings you into the next round, there are all the emotions going round,"" Villas-Boas said. ""Everyone is buzzing to continue in this competition, which is why we reacted so joyfully. We regret sometimes being a team who needs to react and we only reacted after we conceded the goal tonight, but over the two legs we deserved to go through."" Lyon's participation in this tournament had represented something of a comedown, in light of their having been Champions League ever-presents since 1999, but Villas-Boas had made plain his delight to have a tilt at the trophy. His use of the Europa League, initially to familiarise the squad with his match-day methods and then to build belief and momentum, has been a feature of his first season in charge, and now he has a mouth-watering last-16 meeting with Internazionale, his former club, which will stoke memories of Bale-fired Champions Leagues ties from two seasons ago. ""We still have to make even bigger steps and Inter Milan represents exactly that,"" Villas-Boas said. ""We had two magnificent games against them and we just want to recreate that special night [in the home tie] that everyone remembers at the club. ""Going through against Inter Milan and Lyon puts you in a good place to win the competition,"" he added. Tottenham's first-half display had hardly advertised what was to come, at an arena where the atmosphere was pulsating. The capacity crowd whistled Bale from the outset while they jeered the goalkeeper Brad Friedel whose crime, presumably, was not being Hugo Lloris, the ex-Lyon favourite. Friedel made a yapping gesture at his tormentors at full-time. Lyon took control of the tie after Kyle Walker, not for the only time, conceded a needless free-kick and the alarm bells sounded as Grenier addressed the ball. His delivery benefited his threat and, with Bale's defensive challenge heart-hearted, the captain Maxime Gonalons powered his header past Friedel. Lyon might have scored sooner only forbut Alexandre Lacazette's header lacked power. Tottenham were laboured in the first half, there was a recklessness in some of their tackling and their passing lacked incision. Lewis Holtby hit the post from 25 yards before the break but Lyonhad other chances, and looked the slicker and more thrusting. Villas-Boas's team had to be better in the second half and they were. Their tempo was higher and they pressed further up the pitch. The action pulsed and there were chances at both ends. Bale volleyed wide from Emmanuel Adebayor's cross while Grenier shot straight at Friedel and Lacazette sought a penalty, after going down over Friedel's leg. The referee, Wolfgang Stark, was correct to ignore the appeals. Friedel had pulled his leg away. Adebayor hooked on to the top of the crossbar; Bale twice worked Remy Vercoutre from distance. It shaped into a thriller. Villa-Boas brought on Clint Dempsey on the left and unleashed Bale through the middle. Gylfi Sigurdsson was introduced on the right and Tottenham pushed. Bale was everywhere. Dempsey had headed over from a Bale corner and it looked as though Tottenham's calvary charge might yield nothing more than gallant failure. Dembl, however, tore up the script. ""We want to continue setting the example in this competition,"" Villas-Boas said. ""We think it's a real example for England. I don't think the Europa League is a distraction, I think it's an inspiration. Results like this give confidence for Inter and the Premier League.""",Raw Data

Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? The Arizona Diamondbacks finally found a deal they liked for the right fielder, sending Upton and third baseman Chris Johnson to the Atlanta Braves in a seven-player deal. The Braves sent Martin Prado and pitcher Randall Delgado as part of a five-player package to Arizona in return. Atlanta also included Zeke Spruill, Nick Ahmed and Brandon Drury. Prado, the key player from Atlanta’s side, is only under club control for one more year. The Diamondbacks are expected to sign him to a long-term deal in the near future, according to Jack Magruder of Fox Sports Arizona. He was popular in Atlanta, with one former Brave saying letting Prado go was “a bad move.” For some broods, baseball is in the blood, like these MLB dynasties. Upton, 25, joins his older brother, center fielder B.J. Upton, 28, and right fielder Jason Heyward, 23, to give the Braves one of the best outfields in baseball for at least the next three years. Upton is owed $38.5 million over the next three seasons. The Diamondbacks recently agreed to trade him to the Seattle Mariners, but the M’s were one of four teams on Upton’s no-trade list, and he rejected the deal, sources say.

842,"Torrey Pines may be Tiger Woods’ territory, but he hasn’t won here since 2008. His performance for much of Sunday at the Farmers Insurance Open, though, was reminiscent of his play during those simpler years. Woods shot 3-under-par 69 to take a four-shot lead into the final round, which was to start Sunday after a short break and complete Monday. Woods was six strokes ahead until he reached the par-5 18th, which he bogeyed after finding a bunker off the tee and with his third shot. Brad Fritsch, a 35-year-old rookie off the Web.com Tour, was Woods’ closest pursuer at the end of the third round. He birdied No. 18 to reach 10 under par. Fritsch is trying to extend this streak: A 2012 Web.com Tour graduate has finished first or second in each of the season's first two full-field events. Woods was victorious the last time he played on a Monday at Torrey Pines. That was in the 2008 US Open, where he needed 19 holes to dispatch of Rocco Mediate. This is Woods' largest 54-hole lead since the 2009 BMW Championship. Of course, he’s held the third-round lead only once since then as he has gone through his personal crisis and a prolonged rebuilding process. He missed only two fairways on the front nine Sunday, often twirling his driver as another ball found the fairway. He missed only three greens. Four of Woods’ five birdies came on putts of 3 feet or less. The other was completed by a 6-foot putt. If Woods hangs on, it will be his eighth PGA Tour victory at Torrey Pines. He has won the Farmers Insurance Open and its various incarnations six times, as well as that 2008 US Open. He’ has won a major in five of the six seasons during which he won the Farmers Insurance Open. Of course, those victories came during some of his most successful seasons.

Thirty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have passed concussion legislation for youth athletes, often referred to as the Lystedt Law. Here are the states that have not. • Arkansas • Georgia • Hawaii* • Michigan* • Mississippi • Montana • New Hampshire* • Nevada* • Ohio* • South Carolina* • Tennessee • Vermont • West Virginia* * -- Legislation pending Sources: NFL, FOXSports.com research Part I examined the passage of the first Lystedt Law three years ago, which calls for major reforms in how youth sports concussions and brain injuries are treated and diagnosed. The law is designed to prevent what happened to Zack Lystedt, who suffered brain damage at age 13 as a result of returning to the football field prematurely after having suffered a prior concussion and getting re-injured. Thirteen states have yet to sign a law to protect youth athletes from the risks associated with post-concussion trauma. But it’s one of the 37 states that did pass such legislation that could be the best example of how the inner workings of lawmaking can thwart a common sense approach to safeguarding the nation’s most vulnerable athletes. “I felt very frustrated to be honest,” Wyoming senator Bill Landen told FOXSports.com. “I can remember having several down nights thinking that even though this was a very good bill, it would be shot down in one of the two houses (of the legislature). What you learn in politics is that sometimes you have to compromise and get what you can.” What was left turned out to be weakest of any of the bills signed into law nationally, legislation often referred to as the Lystedt Law named after Zackery Lystedt, who, at age 13, suffered brain damage when he returned to a football game prematurely after an initial concussion. (This month marks the three-year anniversary of the first law passed in Lystedt's home state of Washington.) The legislation Wyoming signed into law last year called only for the state department of education to work with local officials to “develop model protocols for addressing risks associated with concussions and other head injuries resulting from athletic injuries.” But local school districts are under no obligation “to adopt any part of the model protocols.” Landen, who is also the athletic director at Casper College, said his efforts to keep return-to-play rules, concussion education and other mandates as part of the bill were overrun by what many thought was a civil liberty issue. “That’s some of the feedback that we got,” Landen said. “We were told parents already know the risk their children are in when they play football, basketball or are on the cheer squad. They didn’t want the state coming in and issuing mandates on this or that.” Jeff Miller, NFL’s vice president of government affairs and public policy, is hopeful that Wyoming — and the other states that have yet to even to propose serious legislation — will come around. “Where there have been efforts like Wyoming or states that haven’t passed legislation at all like Georgia and some others, I think it’s only a matter of time,” Miller said. “It is frustrating that some states haven’t passed it. So many other states have passed (more robust) legislation and they chose to do what’s right for kids. More people are aware of the risks of concussions because of these laws. We are encouraged that Wyoming and other states will come around, maybe not this year, but soon.” South Carolina, for one, doesn’t seem to be in much of a hurry. The state’s House of Representatives failed to move its bill that had the three major tenets of the Lystedt Law out of committee before the so-called “crossover” deadline on May 1, meaning the bill is effectively dead this year. “The feeling is that after we reached out to the South Carolina High School League and talking to coaches, concussions are being handled appropriately already,” said State Rep. Phillip D. Owens, who heads the House’s Education and Public Works Committee where the bill has stagnated. “The state’s high school athletic league already has concussion training and has its own rules for following up (after a concussion). We do have an interest in concussions, but we feel this is being taken care of by the South Carolina High School League.” The South Carolina High School League does have return-to-play guidelines in place, but doesn’t cover every school in the state like a legislative mandate would have. A good portion of the state’s private schools are governed by another association, which has its own set of concussion guidelines. But that’s all they are: guidelines. They don’t have the weight of the state government behind them. “We are trying to get out ahead of it,” said Bruce Hulion, assistant commissioner of the South Carolina High School League. “We’re telling coaches (to follow the guidelines) if you don’t want a law that would make yourself subject to legal action. So, hopefully, the wise ones will follow this protocol and not take any chances. When you are in a ball game and the game’s on the line, some forget that.” South Carolina is joined by a dozen other states — Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia — that have yet to sign concussion legislation into law despite a nearly two-year lobbying effort by the NFL, the family of Zackary Lystedt and other groups. “They need to meet our family. It’s that simple,” said Victor Lystedt, Zackary’s father. “You can’t look and tell me how tough your kids are or, ‘We don’t want a nanny,’ like we’re hearing from a lot of Southern states. I don’t think you’re ever going to meet anybody as tough as my kid. There’s not a player I’ve met who could hold a candle to my son’s therapy every day to get better. “Sometimes it’s weird to find that some really dumb people are lawmakers. How can you not stand up and support this when you have the ability to save a life? As a lawmaker, what more do you want? In our state since Zackary’s law went into effect, we have not lost one kid to a hematoma because of a return-to-play issue. It’s not happening.” Michigan, one state where legislation couldn’t gain a foothold after it was first introduced three years ago, has made significant strides in recent weeks and the proposed law covers all youth athletes, not just ones involved in high school sports. The bill was referred to the state senate’s health policy committee earlier this month and hearing was held last week where Detroit Lions Team President Tom Lewand and Hall of Fame Lions tight end Charlie Sanders lobbied for passage of the bill. “I do believe that this bill can get passed,” said Barbara Semakula, chief resident at Wayne State University and a longtime proponent of concussion legislation in Michigan. “Hopefully they can get it done in this session.” Other states have included athletes outside of those purely participating in high school sports, but the proposed Michigan law is expansive in another way: it lets a wide variety of health professionals to clear a youth athlete after a concussion. “A youth athlete who has been removed from physical participation in an athletic activity ... shall not return to physical participation in the athletic activity until he or she has been evaluated by an appropriate health professional and receives written clearance,” Senate Bill No. 1122 reads. “Appropriate health professional” is open to interpretation and Semakula said could include not only doctors, but nurse practitioners, athletic trainers, neuropsychologist and chiropractors. “We don’t want to exclude any medical professional who has undergone the proper training (to diagnose and treat head trauma),” Semakula said. “There are sports chiropractors who go through two years of extra training and have been through seminars on concussions. They are probably more qualified to clear an athlete than an OBGYN.” A main reason why Michigan’s proposed law doesn’t specify a medical doctor as the only health professional allowed to clear an athlete is access. “You don’t want to have a kid who should be cleared miss an entire season because it took him or her six months to get to a big city,” Semakula said. Several states have seen extensive lobbying by different associations who want their membership to be allowed to clear athletes. Some — like the National Athletic Trainers’ Association — have worked hand in hand with the NFL, while other groups have taken other routes to be heard. A lobbying group for chiropractors, for example, was successful in delaying a bill in the Florida legislature. “Diagnosing concussions and other closed head-wound injuries are taught in all of our schools,” said Jack Hebert, director of government affairs for the Florida Chiropractic Association. “It was very important (to be included in the bill) because of our history in the state. It would have been a loss of status. This falls within the scope of practice (of a chiropractor).” The proposed law in Florida was eventually amended to allow the state’s high school athletics association to determine what constituted a medical professional. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bill into law earlier this month. “You hear horror stories of who wants to be that person (able to clear athletes),” said Marjorie J. Albohm, president of the National Athletic Trainers’ Association. “Based on their knowledge, skills and ability, chiropractors are not considered qualified to make concussion-related return-to-play decisions.” For those seeking to get those final states on board, the legislative obstacles — whether it be because of bureaucracy or lobbying efforts — remain frustrating. “Even in the fractionated political world we live in, this is a common sense law that deserves a consensus vote,” said Stanley Herring, director of the Sports, Spine and Orthopaedic Health for University of Washington Medicine and key backer of the Lystedt Law. “This transcends politics. We can all agree that this is helpful. It’s something to make sure that the brains and health of our youth athletes are being protected as best as possible.” Senior NFL writer Alex Marvez contributed to this report.",Raw Data
845,"Katie Rutan played her best game in the Atlantic Coast Conference and feels more comfortable than ever on No. 10 Maryland's multitalented team. The best news for Rutan, though? She might be losing her protective face mask she's worn for almost a month. Rutan scored 16 points off four 3-pointers as the Terps won their 12th straight game over Clemson, 80-40 on Sunday. Rutan, a Xavier transfer who sat out last season, is growing into the reliable outside shooter who prevents defenses from collapsing on Maryland's seemingly endless roster of tall, talented post players. ''Yeah, it's just a process and it takes a little bit of time to get used to stuff,'' Rutan said. ''The way I'm feeling now is really good.'' And that clear, plastic hockey-style mask she's worn to protect her nose, which she broke on Jan. 3? ''It's good. We're at four weeks today, so I might be getting out'' of it soon, she said with a wide smile. Not that it's affected her aim much. Rutan's gone 13 of 22 from the floor the past three games, all in starting roles. She broke things open for Maryland (17-3, 8-1 ACC) against the Tigers (5-14, 1-7) with three straight 3-pointers in the opening half to turn a 19-12 lead into a 28-14 runaway. Maryland coach Brenda Frese says Rutan has been ready to play. ''She allows us to have a real inside-outside game,'' the coach said. ''We know how talented we are with our bigs, but to really stretch the defense like that is critical.'' The Terps did plenty of damage with their inside game, too. Coming off a stellar, 85-59 win over No. 11 North Carolina this past Thursday night, Maryland picked right up against the Tigers. Tianna Hawkins, the ACC's leading scorer, had 17 points and 10 rebounds, her 11th game this year with double-figure points and boards. Alicia DeVaughn made 6 of 7 shots for 14 points. Alyssa Thomas, second to Hawkins in league scoring and tied with her for the rebounding lead, posted her 12th double-double this season with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Even 6-foot-4 freshman Malina Howard got into the act with 16 points on 8-of-12 shooting. In all, the Terps finished with a season's best showing from the field, hitting 33 of 56 shots (58.9 percent). Hawkins said the team talked about not letting up at Clemson after the North Carolina win. ''It takes one game at a time for us to get where we want to go,'' she said. The Terps won their seventh straight since their lone league loss to North Carolina back on Jan. 3. Maryland dominated the rematch with the Tar Heels and kept the offensive show going at Littlejohn Coliseum. Nikki Dixon had 17 points to lead Clemson, which has lost seven of eight. Maryland outrebounded Clemson 44-23 and held the Lady Tigers to 25 percent shooting (14 of 56) for the game. Lady Tigers coach Itoro Coleman said her team started the game flat and unlike a 60-46 loss to fourth-ranked Duke were not able to tighten things up and get themselves back in contention. ''We had a chance to respond early and we just didn't,'' she said. ''We got deeper and deeper and deeper in the hole and we could not dig ourselves out of it.'' The Terps led 44-18 at the half and grew the lead to 45 points late in the second period. Maryland came out fast, making six of its first seven shots for a 13-2 lead that only increased at Littlejohn Coliseum. Rutan was the big reason why, breaking things wide open with three consecutive 3-pointers. Howard's bucket gave Maryland a 36-16 lead and Chloe Pavlech followed with a 3-pointer. And the Terps accomplished the large lead without Thomas, held to one field goal the first 20 minutes. The Lady Tigers had hung tough with fourth-ranked Duke for about 30 minutes before falling 60-46 last Thursday night. This time, they didn't have the height or stamina to stay with Maryland. Clemson went more than 10 minutes without a field goal as the Terps went on a 22-4 run to the finish of the half. The Lady Tigers made only 7 of 27 shots the opening half and were outrebounded 25-9. Maryland started three players up front in Hawkins, Thomas and DeVaughn who are 6-2 or taller - more than Clemson had available for the game. The game was the second of a doubleheader after Clemson's men beat Virginia Tech 77-70 and the school hoped for a solid crowd for the women's game. But just a fraction of the 7,950 who attended the first game stayed for the nightcap.",Raw Data
846,"Prior to 2012, Zack Greinke had never really pitched in a big city. Aside from some starts on the road, during which he took a team bus to the stadium, the 29-year-old has likely did not have to battle traffic all that often while pitching in places like Kansas City and Milwaukee. Now, $158 million has brought him to one of the most popular cities in America. If all goes to plan, Greinke will have to attend 82 home games at Dodger Stadium with the Los Angeles Dodgers this season. That will likely mean sitting in a lot of traffic on the way to the ballpark, which is something the right-hander has been dreading so much that he looked into alternatives. Like, for example, helicopter travel. I did. I looked into it but I dont think you can land at the stadium, Greinke told Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register. Its not as easy as it sounds. Greinke probably got a little taste of the California traffic while pitching with the Los Angeles Angels last season, but now he is stuck with it. If Magic Johnson and company really want to make their new ace comfortable, they might want to toss a helicopter pad somewhere near the stadium. Theyve spent enough money since taking over in an attempt to build a contender. Whats a few more bucks? Then again, Greinke could always be like this NBA star and ride his bicycle to home games. That would help ease some of the traffic burden.",Raw Data
847,"– The Pistons scored on their first four possessions and led New Orleans 8-0 less than two minutes after tipoff, but not much went right after that. Robin Lopez, who averages 11 points, had 13 before the first quarter was over on his way to 23 points and 10 rebounds. Ryan Anderson came off the Hornets’ bench to score 31 points, hitting five triples, including two back-breakers in the final 46 seconds of the first half and one late in the game after the pistons had cut a 20-point deficit to 12. Rodney Stuckey scored 19 points, 13 of them at the foul line, to lead the Pistons. Greg Monroe recorded his seventh straight double-double with 17 points and 11 boards. On a night anticipated as the first meeting between rookies Andre Drummond and Anthony Davis, the Pistons sorely missed Drummond’s energy and athleticism. BLUE COLLAR – The Pistons were intent on landing a big man in the 2010 draft. If Greg Monroe hadn’t been available, it’s likely the Pistons would have taken Ed Davis, with some consideration to Ekpe Udoh. But Al Farouq-Aminu was on their short list, too, and after not showing a lot in his first two seasons the light is coming on him for this year. Farouq-Aminu, a terrific athlete who shows potential to also have a polished skill set someday, had a double-double by midway through the third quarter and finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds. RED FLAG – The Pistons won a game Saturday with the odds stacked against them. They’d played on Friday – and snapped San Antonio’s 11-game win streak in the process – and then traveled to Milwaukee, where the Bucks were waiting for them after being idle Friday. The shoe was on the other foot Monday. New Orleans lost at Toronto on Sunday while the Pistons were home and off. And after jumping to the quick 8-0 lead, the Pistons were in position to bury a tired team. But the Hornets dominated from that point on and held the Pistons to 36 percent shooting while outrebounding them 49-41. On a night fans were robbed of what should have been the first meeting of rookies Andre Drummond and Anthony Davis, the Pistons felt the sting of Drummond’s absence for the first time since learning late last week he’d miss at least a month with a back injury. Drummond and Davis were widely considered the top two candidates to become the No. 1 pick in 2012 before the 2011-12 college season began and Drummond’s productivity didn’t come close to matching expectations. That bit of serendipity allowed the Pistons to get a player with the ninth pick who has clearly demonstrated there should have been a spirited predraft debate about the merits of Drummond vs. Davis for the No. 1 pick. More than the intrigue of seeing Drummond and Davis line up side by side, though, Drummond’s absence was felt on Monday for what he could have provided to a team that needed every bit of the athleticism, defensive presence and sheer energy he so often gave them in the season’s first 50 games. Coming off consecutive wins over San Antonio, snapping the Spurs’ 11-game win streak, and at Milwaukee, the Pistons simply got outplayed – and, by their own admission, outworked – by the 17-34 New Orleans Hornets in a 105-86 loss. “They just outplayed us, simple as that,” New Orleans native son Greg Monroe said. “They outworked us. They played harder than us.” “You just look at what they put into the game vs. what we put into the game,” Lawrence Frank said. “They deserved to kick our butt and they did.” The Pistons lost their share of games with Drummond in the lineup this season, of course, and as recently as two weeks ago they got similarly outworked by Milwaukee in a lopsided home loss even with Drummond. But there have also been many games in which a high-energy infusion from the bench – Drummond central to the cause – has turned sluggish performances into wins, or at least brought the Pistons into position to win. “He’s definitely a big part of what we do,” Monroe said. “Him being out puts us at a disadvantage. The energy that he brings on both ends, it was a big help for us. I’m pretty sure he would have affected the game in some way – I’m pretty sure of that.” Davis, for his part, showed that being the No. 1 pick doesn’t mean he comes to the NBA a finished product. Though Davis did grab eight rebounds and block four shots, he scored one point and missed all seven of his shots, many of them badly. But the Hornets didn’t need his scoring with Robin Lopez, an improved player in his fifth season, dropping 13 points on the Pistons in the first quarter on his way to 23 plus 10 rebounds. Ryan Anderson hit the biggest shots for New Orleans, including two triples in the last minute of the first half to boost its halftime lead to 14 and a dagger inside the last five minutes after the Pistons had shown a pulse in cutting a 20-point deficit to 12. Anderson scored 34 off the bench. Scoring proved an immense struggle for the Pistons, but it didn’t start that way. They scored the game’s first eight points – four different players scoring on each of their first four possessions – and New Orleans coach Monty Williams burned a timeout before the game was two minutes old. It deserves consideration as the best use of a timeout in the NBA all season. Because it went straight downhill from there for the Pistons. New Orleans tied the game before the Pistons scored another point and outscored them 55-33 over the rest of the half. The Pistons didn’t get any closer than 11 the rest of the way, and that came early in the third quarter. “I think we’ve played some good basketball throughout the week, but this is a definite step back,” Kyle Singler said. “We didn’t really play well. Guys feel that. We’re going to come in tomorrow with a new mind-set and just get ready for the next game. It’s very disappointing. You don’t want to play like this. You’ve just got to move on.” It was just the sixth game this season the Pistons failed to make at least 30 field goals and the first such game since they lost to the Clippers on Dec. 17, nearly two months ago. “I don’t think guys were out there taking bad shots,” Monroe said. “I don’t think that’s been the case at any point this season. You make some, you miss some. They did a good job playing defense. We didn’t get as many looks as we did in previous games.” The Pistons had come in on an offensive roll, too, especially since adding Jose Calderon, scoring 119 and 105 in the two weekend wins. They missed a slew of shots at the rim, including two fairly uncontested transition layups early in the second half that could have turned momentum. “You can definitely get a lift,” Singler said of those opportunities. “You can also get knocked back when you’ve got easy baskets you can make and you miss them. If those go in, it gives our team a boost.” “Some of it we just didn’t finish at the rim,” Frank said. “Some of ’em we put up some questionable shots at the rim and some of ’em maybe there was some contact. Then we started to get frustrated and we allowed that to impact in all phases of our game. “Every mistake we made, they made us pay. After scoring some of the numbers we did, maybe we just thought it was going to come to us and it doesn’t work like that. Tough lesson.” True Blue Pistons",Raw Data
848,"The Boston Celtics swiped a double-overtime win over the Miami Heat without Rajon Rondo on Sunday, but the knee injury that led to Rondo’s absence — and the fact that it’ll keep him sidelined for the remainder of the season — could be a precursor for disaster, a harbinger for change or both for a team already in danger of missing the postseason for the first time since 2007, before the Celtics started the Big Three movement. Rondo, the NBA’s assist leader and a fan-voted starter in next month’s All-Star game, initially injured the knee Friday in a double-OT loss to Atlanta. In that game, the sixth straight defeat for Boston, the Celtics blew a 27-point first-half lead despite getting a second consecutive triple-double from Rondo, who leads all players with 23 such games since the start of the 2008-09 season, including 10 in the playoffs. After feeling pain in the knee during Sunday morning’s shootaround at TD Garden, Rondo went to the hospital, where tests revealed that he had torn his right ACL. The prognosis isn’t good, of course, nor is it ever when a player sustains an injury that severe. Even the absolute best-case scenario would put Rondo back on the floor sometime during the first half of next season — though the precedent with this type of injury suggests it could be longer. That gives the Celtics about a year to figure out their next move, because they can’t stand idly by with Rondo on the shelf. If Boston has any aspirations of competing this season or at any point going forward, it needs to have a serious discussion about the direction of the franchise, and it might be in the team’s best interests to start looking at alternatives for what they already have. Because the inevitable demise of the Celtics team that has been the East’s most consistent over the last half-decade could finally be a reality with Rondo out long-term. See where we rank Rajon Rondo among NBA's top 10 point guards. Essentially, the Celtics have three choices as they analyze their immediate future, and their long-term status: 1) They can maintain the status quo and continue on the track that had them barely holding onto the eighth seed in the East even with Rondo, putting the rebuilding discussion on hold for another year. 2) They can try to trade for a game-changing playmaker to fill in for Rondo and hope that it’s enough to stay competitive in a race for second place that has no clear frontrunner. 3) They can blow up the entire operation and reconstruct, a thought they’ve been flirting with for what feels like forever. None of them is particularly popular, but only one — doing nothing — is a virtual certainty to fail. A quick look at Boston’s win-loss record without Rondo over the years would have you believe things are OK with him out, as the Celtics have actually gotten by fine without their sparkplug guard in the past. After Sunday's win, Boston is 25-16 overall with Rondo out since he became the team's full-time starting point guard in 2007. But this year’s team is a year older than the team that was already too old last year, and they’ve done little to suggest that somehow they’d be better without their best player on the floor from here on out. The idea of rallying around a fallen comrade works in the movies, but I don’t see this year’s group having any more of the kind of fairytale magic that carried them to within one win of last year’s NBA Finals. If they choose to take that route, though, the Celtics would almost certainly have to revert to the strategy they used last January, when Rondo missed eight games with an injured right wrist. During that span, which saw the Celtics go 6-2 after a 5-8 start to the season, Avery Bradley stepped in as the team’s starting point guard — serving more of a defensive role than anything else — as ball-handling duties were turned over to Paul Pierce. In that stretch, Pierce averaged 21.5 points on 47.9 percent shooting and dished out 7.5 assists to go with six boards a night, all up from his season averages. Pierce put some of that versatility on display Sunday, with 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in the win. But with Boston shorthanded for the foreseeable future, the team’s longest-tenured player is going to need to be as crafty as ever, and I’m not sure he’s prepared to carry that load. The Celtics do have one thing going for them, and that’s the conference they play in. As of Sunday, Boston is 21-23 — three games back of Milwaukee for the No. 7 seed in the East, and the only thing saving them from missing the playoffs could be the unthreatening gaggle of teams on their heels. The Celtics are currently 2-1/2 games ahead of Philadelphia, four games ahead of Detroit, five games ahead of Toronto and 6-1/2 games ahead of the Magic. So a playoff spot seems reasonable for the Celtics. However, a series win is anything but, and that’s why they may need to make a trade if they want to be competitive once they get there. That’s easier said than done, though. The market isn’t exactly flush with elite backcourt options, and certainly there’s no one available and easily attainable who can match Rondo’s skillset and ability to quarterback the game. So some very careful thought should be put into who, if anyone, would actually make the desired difference right now without complicating the long-term plan — which is where the team’s spotlight should ultimately be shining. Trade or no trade, the Celtics can’t compete with the Heat or any of the Western Conference’s powers this year, so they might as well put the time and effort into figuring out how to get there in the years to come, because the other option is fading into the ether. Last year, Celtics GM Danny Ainge toyed with the thought of rebuilding, and this is the perfect opportunity to actually do it, frustrating as it may be for fans. Pierce and Kevin Garnett are too old to build a team around, but they have enough value that dealing them would be worthwhile, and role players like Jeff Green, Brandon Bass, Jason Terry and Courtney Lee could fit well on a contender with a particular need and draft picks to shed. As it stands right now, the Celtics have enough assets to give themselves a chance to retool around Rondo when he returns, and it’s an opportunity they won’t have for long, so they should act. The latest incarnation of the fading Celtics was only a marginal contender with Rondo to begin with, and it won’t be one at all without him. And while no one would ever wish for Rondo to go down like he did, Boston needs to make the most of its situation and make a long overdue move with the future in mind. The result won’t be pretty over the next few months or even the next couple years, but it’s the right strategy for a team that’s dangerously close to becoming irrelevant.

850,"The Tulsa Shock acquired two former All-Americans from Stanford on Friday, picking up guard Candice Wiggins from the Minnesota Lynx and forward Nicole Powell from the New York Liberty. The three-team deal also sent center Janel McCarville from New York to Minnesota in a sign-and-trade, and the Lynx received Tulsa's second-round pick in 2014. The Liberty got Tulsa's second- and third-round picks in next month's draft, plus the rights to veteran Deanna Nolan, who hasn't played in the WNBA since 2009 after refusing to continue playing for the Shock following the team's move from Detroit. McCarville didn't play in the league the past two seasons, either, but she was excited about joining former college teammate Lindsay Whalen with the two-time defending Western Conference champion Lynx. McCarville and Whalen helped lead Minnesota to the Final Four in 2004, and McCarville was a fan favorite who remains the all-time leader in field-goal percentage and blocked shots in Gophers history. ''Starting position? Right now I could care less about it as long as I'm a part of this tradition that they have and the future that we can build on,'' McCarville said at her introductory news conference in Minneapolis. ''It doesn't matter to me. I'm in it for the game, and I'm happy to be here.'' The Shock also received New York's third-round pick in this year's draft. In Wiggins and Powell, Tulsa gets a pair of established WNBA players to add to a team that has languished near the bottom of the league after being stripped of the stars who won championships in Detroit. ''Both have been on WNBA championship teams and bring a wealth of experience, knowledge and skill to our young team,'' Tulsa coach Gary Kloppenburg said. ''They are consummate professionals who are constantly working to improve their game. Their veteran leadership and competitive drive to win will help lead this Shock team toward our ultimate goal of winning a WNBA championship.'' Powell has averaged 10.5 points and 4.3 rebounds during her nine-year career, and she appeared in the 2009 All-Star game as a replacement for an injured Lisa Leslie. Her 7.0-point average last season was the lowest since her rookie season in 2004. Wiggins averaged a career-best 15.7 points as a rookie in 2008 but has seen her numbers drop off as the Lynx made the WNBA Finals the past two seasons, winning the title in 2011 and losing to Indiana last year. Tulsa holds the No. 3 pick in the April 15 draft, which appears loaded this year with Baylor's Brittney Griner, Notre Dame's Skylar Diggins and Delaware's Elena Delle Donne among the top prospects. ''Candice and Nicole are going to have a huge impact on and off the court with our team heading into the 2013 season,'' Shock President Steve Swetoha said. ''We are truly excited and thrilled to add two solid veterans and leaders to our organization. These are two strong pieces in building a championship team. ''We have a plan for our organization and we couldn't be more excited for the direction we are going.'' Nolan was a four-time All-Star and won three championships with the Shock in Detroit, being named Finals MVP in 2006. In New York she will be reunited with former Detroit coach Bill Laimbeer - entering his first season with the Liberty - as well as former teammates Plenette Pierson and Katie Smith. Another ex-Detroit teammate, Kara Braxton, spent the last 1 1/2 seasons in New York and is an unrestricted free agent. McCarville started every game for New York from 2008 to 2010, averaging 8.8 points in her final season with the Liberty. The native of Stevens Point, Wis., will return to Minnesota, where she was a second-team All-American before being the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 draft. With McCarville, the Lynx now have three former No. 1 overall draft picks with Seimone Augustus (2006) and Maya Moore (2011). ''We want to maintain our high level of play and every year we have to try and make improvements to that, and we think that Janel can be a big part with keeping us at the level we have been at,'' Lynx chief executive officer Roger Griffith said.",Raw Data
851,"With the first day of testing there is so much excitement within the team. But for us the excitement was very shortlived, doing three laps this morning and having the fuel-pump issue. Its never what you want at the start of a test, but its better to have it at the start than at the end so we can solve the issue. When I went out this afternoon I was eventually able to do some runs on different tyres to get a feel for the car. In terms of that, its a nice starting point but not the mileage we obviously hoped for. So it wasnt the best. Today wasnt the perfect day with the issues and there is still a lot of work for us to do before we get this car in a position where were happy with it. As for whether its a championship-winning car, who knows? The important thing is, theres a nice feeling with the car. After finishing eight-tenths of a second up on Webber, 33-year-old Button joked: ""I dont know how I did it  I think I cut the chicane! I was surprised when I saw the dash, but the time doesnt mean anything."" Lap times mean nothing right now and they wont mean anything at the last test. Its all about the first race when we will have a very different car then, as every team will, and thats when we need to show how quick we are. Lewis Hamilton will give his new Mercedes racer a first serious test run today. And he will hoping he has a better time than team-mate Nico Rosberg, who had to abandon the first day of testing after just 14 laps with flames licking out of the back of his car. Rosberg set the early pace before the W04  only unveiled on Monday  caught fire and broke down. After signing a three-year contract with Mercedes, who have won just one race in three seasons on their return to F1, Hamilton will drive the car for the first time today. He will have been cheered up by Rosberg insisting the car is a big improvement on the one he drove last year which gave him a win in China before a long decline over the rest of the season. ""I can guarantee you it will be a big step forward, but of course everybody else is also moving forward and were hoping that weve closed the gap, said Rosberg. I cant say if the car was quick or not, but feeling-wise I was very comfortable. I could push, the balance was okay, and it was enjoyable to drive.""",Raw Data
852,"Motherwell 0-1 Dundee Utd Dundee United spoiled James McFadden's Motherwell return, with Johnny Russell scoring the only goal in a lively Scottish Premier League tussle. A great run and pass from Gary Mackay-Steven set Russell up to slot home on 17 minutes at Fir Park. Jackie McNamara's men were a real threat on the break, with the tricky Mackay-Steven menacing throughout. The home side saw a lot of the ball but seldom threatened, with McFadden's introduction failing to inspire them. Play media The Scotland forward, who will be with the club for the rest of the season, came off the bench on 73 minutes but could not prevent Motherwell falling to their first home defeat of 2013. United edge up one place to eighth and are now just two points worse off than Inverness in third place. Stuart McCall's team did most of the early pressing, with Brian McLean hooking a clearance narrowly wide of his own goal, while Chris Humphrey and Nicky Law went close with shots. But the home side were undone by a great Mackay-Steven burst as the midfielder slipped the ball through for Russell who showed excellent composure to fire the ball past keeper Darren Randolph. Russell then seized on some slack defending by Steven Hammell to curl an effort just over from 20 yards. Motherwell again began strongly after the re-start but it was United who would create the best chances, with the visitors spurning two opportunities to extend their lead within the space of a minute. Mackay-Steven forced Randolph into a good stop with his feet and Jon Daly headed over the bar from the edge of the six-yard box. Play media Motherwell's Simon Ramsden called Radoslaw Cierzniak into action with a low shot on 70 minutes, but again it was United who almost profited on the break - Mackay-Steven twice bringing out superb stops from Randolph. He then passed up a glorious chance when he failed to convert after the Republic of Ireland stopper denied Richie Ryan. The Motherwell supporters roared in approval as McFadden made his first appearance since rejoining the club. The introduction of the former Everton man sparked life into the home crowd and they were almost rewarded when Law floated a shot just over the crossbar. Mackay-Steven had yet another chance to put the game out sight when he brilliantly controlled Stuart Armstrong's pass and this time beat Randolph, however Shaun Hutchinson made an excellent goal-line stop.",Raw Data
853,"Catchings had won three Olympic gold medals and an NCAA championship at Tennessee in 1998, but never one in the WNBA. She scored 25 points to help the Indiana Fever win their first WNBA title with an 87-78 victory over the Minnesota Lynx on Sunday night. While Catchings was impressive, Erin Phillips and Erlana Larkins played the best basketball of their careers in the Finals to help their leader complete the circle. ''Everybody talks about the missing piece in Tamika Catchings' career, and our players took that personally,'' Indiana coach Lin Dunn said. ''I really believe that was an incentive.'' Even Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve, public enemy No. 1 in Indiana for her outbursts and interactions with the fans, felt Catchings deserved to win a title. ''There's not anybody that cannot be happy for Tamika Catchings to finally get a championship,'' Reeve said. ''We were trying to keep her from getting it, but it didn't happen, and now that she's got it, she's easy to be happy.'' Catchings, who was the MVP of the Finals, averaged 22.3 points in the series, which the Fever won 3-1 over the defending WNBA champions. She had been in a position to clinch at home before. The Fever led Phoenix 2-1 in the best-of-five WNBA Finals in 2009, but the Mercury beat the Fever 90-77, took the series back to Phoenix and won the title at home in Game 5. This time, Catchings took it home with Pat Summitt, her coach at Tennessee, looking on in the crowd. The two shared a long hug after the victory. She shed a lot of tears in the postgame celebration. ''When you come into this league, your goal and dream is to win a WNBA championship,'' said Catchings. ''Twelve years later . it's so sweet right now.'' Phillips had 18 points and eight rebounds, while Shavonte Zellous and Briann January each had 15 points. The Fever won even though No. 2 scorer Katie Douglas missed most of the series with a severely sprained left ankle. Douglas checked in for the first time in the series with 3.2 seconds left in Game 4 to a loud ovation. Minnesota was trying to become the first team to repeat since Los Angeles in 2001 and 2002. ''It was hard being the hunted, as we all know,'' Reeve said. ''There's a reason this hasn't been done in over 10 years. I really felt like if there was a team that could do it, it was our team.'' Indiana held Minnesota below 40 percent shooting in all three wins. ''They played good defense,'' Minnesota guard Lindsay Whalen said. ''They contested shots and they made it tough for us to get in the lane a little bit. I think that was the theme of the whole series. They were just tough, and give them credit for the way they played.'' Indiana led 63-58 at the end of the third quarter. Minnesota cut Indiana's lead to 70-67 on a jumper by Maya Moore, but Phillips scored on a drive past Moore, got a defensive rebound, then found Zellous for a 3-pointer from the left corner to give the Fever a 75-67 lead with 4:58 remaining. Indiana led by at least five points the rest of the way. A 3-pointer by January gave Indiana an 80-72 lead with 1:18 to play. Reeve was called for a technical with 57.6 seconds remaining, Catchings made the free throw and the Fever took an 81-74 lead. Zellous made two more free throws with 27.2 seconds to play, and Fever fans began celebrating. Seimone Augustus, Minnesota's leading scorer in the playoffs, was held to eight points on 3-for-21 shooting. She shot 6-for-30 in the final two games of the series after the Fever switched January over to guard her. Catchings said January, who was on the WNBA first-team all-defense squad, did her job. ''I think she set the tone,'' Catchings said. ''All (Augustus') baskets were hard. She used up all her energy in the first quarter.'' Whalen scored 22 points and Moore added 16 points for the Lynx, who were vying to become the first team to win consecutive titles since Los Angeles in 2001 and 2002. Moore picked up her third foul with 6:13 left in the second quarter. Reeve, who was fined for her jacket-tossing tantrum in Game 2, became animated again while disagreeing with the call. As the crowd erupted, Reeve waved hello and made the motion for a technical foul. This time, Reeve's antics didn't help much as in Game 2, when her team pulled away from a tight contest for a convincing win. Minnesota tied the game three times in the second quarter, but the Fever closed with a 7-2 run, including a 3-pointer by Phillips, to take a 47-42 lead at halftime. Whalen scored 14 points in the first half to keep the Lynx in the game, often scoring on uncontested drives. Minnesota hung tough, despite Augustus shooting 2 for 13 in the first half. It was right there for the Fever. ''Coming into halftime, we said we have 20 minutes and we're not trying to go back to Minnesota to close this thing out,'' Zellous said. Indiana started the second half on a 9-4 run, including two buckets by Catchings, to take a 56-46 lead. Minnesota came right back. A driving layup by Moore cut Indiana's lead to 56-54 and forced the Fever to call timeout. Minnesota tied the game on another drive by Moore, but the Fever responded with a 3-pointer by Catchings and a basket by Jessica Davenport to push the lead back to five by the end of the quarter. Indiana then closed the deal at home in front of a sellout crowd. ''They made some huge runs at us and gave it everything at us, and I'm just relieved more than anything because we deserve this,'' Phillips said. ''We've been through so much as a team, we've lost in crucial times and we've stuck together. I'm just so proud right now.''",Raw Data
854,"Rory McIlroy's Nike tribulations continue. This was not in the lucrative, high-profile script. The Northern Irishman suffered a shock first-round defeat by Shane Lowry amid high drama on Thursday evening at the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona. McIlroy had been two up on his opponent, the lowest ranked player in the field, after four holes but conceded defeat by a hole on the final green. Having made his debut with Nike equipment in Abu Dhabi a month ago, McIlroy has now suffered a missed cut and opening-round defeat in his first two events of 2013. Wayward iron shots, ominously, have proved the hallmark of McIlroy's last two outings. He came within inches of taking Lowry to extra holes with an 18th-hole bunker shot but the man from County Offaly prevailed. The highlights of Lowry's famous victory were converted chips from greenside rough on the 11th and 12th holes. ""I had too many loose iron shots,"" McIlroy conceded. ""I probably should have been a few up after five holes, let Shane get back in and he had a nice run."" Lowry himself was low-key. ""It is important not to get too high after the first round,"" he said. McIlroy was far from the only golfing luminary to made a premature departure from Tucson. Tiger Woods also slumped to defeat in his first round against Charles Howell III. For a player with such a formidable match-play reputation, Ian Poulter still has unfinished business at Dove Mountain. The Englishman, famed for his Ryder Cup performances and a former winner of the Match Play Championship, tumbled out of this competition at the first-round stage in 2011 and 2012. That point was far from lost on Poulter himself, meaning he was especially pleased to close out victory over Stephen Gallacher when play eventually resumed on Thursday afternoon. ""I'm fully aware of my early exits the last couple years and obviously didn't want to do that again,"" Poulter said. ""I think I put in a lot of work during my time off to come out feeling as strong as I possibly can and I've hit a lot of good shots over the last two days, hit a couple of scruffy ones, but I'm pleased with the way I came out to get through that match. ""I'm very much looking forward to trying to go all the way. And matchplay is matchplay, we never know. You can play fantastic and be going home. I take each match as it comes and see if I can get by."" Poulter had been three up on Gallacher before the storm chaos which so seriously impacted on the tournament on Wednesday afternoon. Some 26 hours later the pair returned to the course with Poulter eventually progressing by 2&1 to meet Bo Van Pelt. ""It's obviously difficult when you're up in a match and you get called in,"" Poulter said. ""It's easy to lose concentration. ""It's certainly easy to lose concentration when they've asked you to be here ready to tee off at 8.30 in the morning, knowing there is five inches of snow and it's 32 degrees outside. ""That's not rocket science to know it's not going to thaw. ""That's five hours waiting around to get out there on the golf course. I think it's easy to do the wrong things. I think everybody tried to be aware of that and try and manage their time properly, and you have to put your foot down the second you get on the golf course."" Justin Rose almost suffered on account of the opposite reaction, with Poulter's regular Ryder Cup partner pegged back from four up on KJ Choi to all square by the 12th. Rose eventually regained his composure sufficiently to win 2&1. ""I don't care about my play, I feel good about my win,"" Rose said. ""That's what it is all about this week. ""I felt edgy all the way through the back nine. I was nervous. I have come off three weeks off so you are still not used to the competitive juices. ""But I believed in myself. Even though the match wasn't going my way through the back nine, I believed I could still win the game. That comes from confidence, having good experiences and positive experiences on which to draw. ""I was one down to Phil Mickelson in the Ryder Cup and turned that match around. It was a sort of similar feeling to today, when I had to pull something out towards the end."" There was a wounding loss, though, for Lee Westwood who did not trail Rafael Cabrera-Bello until it mattered most – on the 19th green. Westwood had stood on the 18th tee one up before his infamous short-game problems came back to haunt him. Sergio Garcia ended up in an unforeseen scrap. The Spaniard started Wednesday with an opportunity from 15ft to defeat Thongchai Jaidee but proceeded to three putt and was eventually taken to extra holes. Garcia made it to round two courtesy of a birdie on the second of them. ""I was pleased to get through but I need to get much better if I want to keep going through this week,"" Garcia admitted. ""I was just fortunate to play that second extra hole well enough and make birdie. But I need to improve a lot."" Garcia now faces Matt Kuchar, who confidently saw off the challenge of Hiroyuki Fujita by 3&2. Among the players to make a surprise exit alongside Westwood at the first-round stage were Adam Scott, who was defeated by Tim Clark, and the former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel, who lost to Russell Henley. Keegan Bradley also headed home after falling to Marcus Fraser by two holes whilst Ernie Els three-putted the last in handing victory to Fredrik Jacobson. Luke Donald did make it to the last 32, courtesy of a final hole birdie to defeat Marcel Siem.",Raw Data

Les Bleus head to south-west London under huge pressure after losing their opening two games of the championship for the first time since 1982. And Rowntree has placed his warriors on high alert for a big backlash. ‘It will change the whole complexion of their Six Nations if they win at the weekend,’ he said. ‘And the way they will challenge us is through their forward pack. ‘There is never a weak French scrum – that area of the game is something we always respect with France.’ Head coach Stuart Lancaster last night named an unchanged 23-man squad for the match. Wasps number eight Billy Vunipola was pressing for selection until he suffered an ankle injury in training. As a result, Lancaster will select his starting XV from the same matchday 23 that defeated Ireland 12-6 in Dublin to stay top of the table. Forward progress: James Haskell leads the charge in training (Picture: Getty)‘We had to make some close calls but the team did very well in Ireland so we’ve gone with the same squad against France,’ Lancaster said.

We haven't won it for almost 10 years, so we really need to have a big performance this year. ""Rio Ferdinand's never won an FA Cup medal - so we really need to do something about that.""

With the history we've got in the competition, we should be there, we should be getting to finals, so hopefully this will be the year."" Ferguson also confirmed that Giggs taking United's penalties would not be a long-term thing, just that he had been given a break from his normal duties. He added: ""With Wayne missing the penalties he has, it was time to give him a break. But he will come back it. ""The one thing about Wayne is that it doesn't faze him if he misses one.

857,"So Chris Canetti, president of Major League Soccer’s Houston Dynamo and a native of Connecticut, where a gunman pointlessly took the lives of 20 elementary school children and six of their teachers and administrators in Newtown on Friday, Dec. 14, picked up the phone. It was the Monday morning after the tragedy, and on a whim while driving to work, he called Eric Da Costa, the head soccer coach at his alma mater Quinnipiac University, located not 20 miles from Newtown. They resolved to do something for the vast soccer community there. Take a look at some images from Soccer Night in Newtown. “I don’t think I’m any different from most Americans who really relate to the sadness of this tragedy and had a desire to do something,” said Canetti, a father of a 5 and an 8-year-old. Canetti quickly found five volunteers on his team to attend and Da Costa secured the Newtown Youth Academy’s indoor soccer field. Word soon trickled out about Soccer Night in Newtown, as they’d dubbed it. Former national teamer Alexi Lalas asked if he could join. Then Mia Hamm did, too, followed by several other men’s and women’s national team legends like Kristine Lilly, Christie Rampone and Cobi Jones. MLS got involved and reached out to its other clubs. So many players volunteered – often offering to pay their own way – that some had to be turned away. Five days before the event, registration was opened exclusively to locals of Newtown. Two time-slots quickly filled up with almost 1,500 people in a town of just 27,000. On a Monday afternoon that didn’t feel quite as cold as the preceding 24 days, a brilliant sun shimmered off a thick sheet of snow. A mile and change from the scene of the crime, hordes of excitable children dressed in their soccer gear flocked to the event. From Dempsey to Reyna, find out the best US footballers of all-time. Hamm and Landon Donovan, who was supposed to be on a sabbatical from the sport, and other American soccer luminaries sat at booths, signing things and posing and chatting. Three dozen other MLS players roamed the cavernous hall, participating in Q&As or joining impromptu pickup games on the artificial turf. Glad shouts and shrieks emanated from bouncy castles. A deejay played in a corner. Lalas ran a chaotic short-sided game for kids who didn’t reach much higher than his knees. A friendly buzz in a happy hive. “We have not seen a lot of smiles in town lately,” said Peter D’Amico, director of the Newtown Youth Academy. “Here we have.” The soccer players were eminently aware of the delicate surroundings they’d stepped into. “You could see it on the faces of the players, when we were preparing for this, all getting together and talking in a hotel earlier today, they were all a little bit nervous,” said MLS commissioner Don Garber. “You’re not quite sure what to expect. You’ve got a lot of families that have been just so traumatized. This whole town has to find a new normal. But I think it’s come off really well. There are a lot of happy people out there, at least for a couple of hours.” Sport, our most interactive form of escapism, can offer a potent sort of catharsis. A famous historian once said that play is the precursor to civilization. So when the latter is shattered, it makes sense to rebuild through the former. “It’s a nice distraction, a diversion – something to look forward to, something to put in your calendar because a lot of us are just putting one foot in front of the other,” said Marianne Grenier, a Newtown mother of two. She knew the families of six of the victims. They were high school friends and gym partners and soccer teammates. Her son Andrew, all big dark eyes with a mop of brown hair, goes to first grade in a different elementary school. But he’s projected to graduate from the local high school in the class of 2024, which is 20 members smaller today than it was a month ago. “I feel an urge to move on,” said Grenier. “It’s been three weeks and we’ve just been all in a fog. It’s a nice moment of collective healing.” A grieving town was given the interlude it craved. “It’s unfortunate that we’re meeting under these circumstances but it’s great to bring a sense of peace, even if it’s for a little bit, to this community,” said Dynamo defender Corey Ashe. If you didn’t know what happened there, you’d never have guessed from the goings-on Monday afternoon. And that was exactly the point. The only tip-off was the message on the green sheets taped to the walls. We are Sandy Hook We choose love Or the first sign you see when you come off interstate 84. Newtown first responders Thanks for your hard work and bravery. The writing was unmistakably that of children, scribbled in bright colors and surrounded by a heart.

The New England Patriots maintained their conference headlock on the Houston Texans for the second time in five weeks, and Sunday’s 41-28 divisional victory at Gillette Stadium went largely as the defending AFC champs had planned. Unfortunately, this was the kind of miserable playoff exit the Texans know all too well after last season. Baltimore ended Houston’s playoff road in 2011 in the second round. Now the city’s streak of failing to advance to the AFC championship round with the Oilers and Texans has extended to 33 frustrating years. Houston has never played host to an AFC title game. As long as Tom Brady (17 playoff victories) continues to stand in the way, that futility streak figures to continue. The former AFC front-runners entered Week 14 at 11-1, then succumbed to a late-season tailspin beginning with a humbling 42-14 loss at Foxboro, losing three of four to end the regular season. In two games this season, Brady and the Patriots put up 83 points against the Texans. But coach Gary Kubiak doesn’t see a gaping hole separating the AFC South champs from the AFC’s most dominant team over the past decade — even if it felt like the Texans were digging themselves out of one through much of second half of their playoff matchup. “We’re right there, as a football team,” Kubiak said. “But I think we’re gonna go back and be really disappointed in our opportunities to make some plays.” There were so many impressive sparks of energy by the Texans that this game never felt truly out of reach until well into the second half. Danieal Manning romped 94 yards on the opening kickoff return to set up a Shayne Graham field goal, and his 35-yard return just before halftime helped set up an Arian Foster 1-yard touchdown plunge that helped the Texans climb to within 17-13 at the break. By then, cracks in the facade had begun to appear. Foster rushed for 47 yards in that Houston scoring drive. But his streak of 100-yard rushing games in the postseason was halted at three when he managed only 33 rushing yards the entire second half. Every time the Texans slipped up with a three-and-out series, or failed to convert a crucial third down, the Patriots capitalized with a vengeance. Brady led the Patriots on a 69-yard touchdown drive to start the third quarter and the score began to balloon. It spun out of control when Texans quarterback Matt Schaub tossed a risky pass he’ll regret when he sees it again. Trailing 24-13 and at the New England 37-yard line, Schaub tried to force a pass to James Casey by throwing it over the head of nimble Pats’ defensive end Rob Ninkovich. This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. Bad idea. Ninkovich plucked the errant pass right out of the air. Six plays later, Brady threw a 5-yard TD pass to Brandon Lloyd and, well, game over. “I guess I’m just blessed,” Ninkovich said. “Right place, right time.” Explained Schaub, “They dropped the D-end (Ninkovich) out there and I just didn’t get enough height on it. “I saw him. I was just trying to get it over the top of him on that play.” In these Patriots-Texans shoving matches, that’s the kind of “oh-no” moment that typically opens the floodgates for New England’s potent offense. “Yeah — when they ultimately get the ball, that’s definitely an ‘oh no’ moment,” Schaub admitted. “We knew we’d get another opportunity to get the ball. But they went down and scored off that turnover, which made our situation more difficult.” It always does. “That’s the thing when you play against a team like this,” said Texans receiver Andre Johnson, who caught eight passes for 95 yards but never saw the end zone. “They’re capable of scoring every time they touch the ball, and we knew that.” At some point, as long as the Patriots continue to stand in their way, the Texans will have to stop forgetting that.",Raw Data
862,"Numbers don’t define great players, but when players who have proven their greatness pass certain career milestones it gives us something more to remember them by and lets us all stop and think about what they’ve meant to our great sport. When Ben Wallace got his 10,000th rebound just last week, it was hard for me not to have all kinds of flashbacks. I remember him before he ever played for the Pistons as a guy who had a huge impact per minute for both Washington and Orlando. I love the fact that not only did Joe Dumars have the vision to get him but that Ben had the perseverance and toughness and work ethic to make himself into one of the greatest defenders this game has ever seen. It’s an amazing story. Although I can’t blame him for taking all that money a few years ago that Chicago offered him, I know this is where he belongs. It’s only fitting that he finish his career here. I remember the day when news broke that Grant Hill was leaving to sign with Orlando as a free agent in the summer of 2000, just a month after Mr. Davidson named Joe D to run the team. You hate to see a guy like Grant leave. In so many ways, he was everything that was good about the game and I can’t help but pull for him these days in Phoenix. He’s finally healthy and proving to everybody what an incredibly productive pro he can be even at his ripe old age. And I’ll never forget what Grant did for us. When you ring up all his numbers, you can make an argument that he was as good as anybody in the game when he was a Detroit Piston. It was a major loss and of course it was depressing. But to bring a guy in here who hung his hat on toughness and hard work, like I knew Ben Wallace would, I felt it was going to be a great plus. I had heard that we had an interest in Ben and Chucky Atkins when the Pistons and Magic decided to work out the sign and trade and I really liked both of them. I can’t tell you that I thought Ben would end up being an all-time great, but I knew he would bring a great physical presence and have a big impact. That’s what we needed at that point – somebody with every bit as much mental and physical toughness as the Bad Boys had. Our fans had been dying for that for years and I had, too. When you grow up on that – and I started with Bob Lanier, and nobody messed with The Dobber – and, next thing I knew, we built the Bad Boys, and nobody messed with any of them. And suddenly we had a guy whose signature was his toughness and a don’t-back-down mentality. So I was excited he would come here. I didn’t expect him to be the centerpiece of the franchise, but I knew he would define our team in terms of toughness, both mental and physical. When Ben first started to make his mark with the Pistons and fans began to get excited about this guy, I had so many people telling me that a guy who does it all on quote-unquote athleticism won’t be able to do that someday. But somewhere in my heart, I knew it was far more than just athleticism and far more than physical toughness. You had to know if it was Ben Wallace, it was mental toughness that truly defined him. I don’t think you come from the background he came from and make it to the stratosphere like he has, to win four Defensive Player of the Year awards, without incredible mental toughness – and, of course, a lot of the skills that are still there. You can be mentally tough and not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but Ben Wallace probably is the sharpest knife in the drawer. He understands this game backwards and forwards, inside and out. And I applaud him for that. As you can probably tell, he’s one of my all-time favorite guys. Look at the active NBA players with 10,000 rebounds – Shaquille O’Neal, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. Two of them were No. 1 overall picks and the third, Garnett, would have been if he wasn’t the first player in a long time to come to the NBA straight out of high school at a time nobody believed a high school kid could make that transition without major problems. And then you have Ben Wallace, who played four years in college and wasn’t drafted by anybody. I believe what that means is in life, don’t you ever take no for an answer. You must pursue your dream. Everybody should use Ben as a role model in that area. All those who said he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, didn’t really know him. As he said recently, he never really listened to those people because he knew in his heart what he could do and we certainly have seen him do it.",Raw Data
863,"Roy Rogers’ pulse raced late last spring as the Pistons were preparing for the June draft and the front office solicited his opinion on a college big man he’d heard about but hadn’t really seen. “I remember sitting in my office and going, ‘This guy could be available?’ ” Rogers recalls today after viewing the DVD compilation of Andre Drummond prepared for him by the front office. “Even though he was raw, you could see just his pure ability – his footwork, his ability to contest shots, his ability to rebound the ball out of his area. I was blown away. I was sold. It’s like ‘Jerry McGuire’ and ‘You had me at hello.’ He had me at the first blocked shot. I was sold.” One week after the draft, the Pistons assistant who works most closely with the team’s big men got his chance at hands-on coaching with Drummond as Pistons staffers gathered in Orlando for Summer League. Nothing about his enthusiasm for Drummond was diminished by their nine days together in Florida. But Rogers knew there was serious work to be done in the two-plus months leading to October’s training camp if Drummond was going to be ready to help as a rookie. And, further, Rogers knew that would require Drummond be willing to accept coaching. It didn’t take long to get his answer. “When you have to coach him hard, he looks you right in the face and he accepts, but not only that, he stores it,” Rogers said. “You can see him trying to make adjustments the next time he’s on the court. The way he accepts coaching gives him a chance to be a special player because he wants to get better.” Players talented enough to be NBA lottery picks often come to the league headstrong, convinced that if their way was good enough to account for lofty draft status there is no compelling argument to change. Rogers found Drummond accepting of suggestions at the first offering. “When we’re in the gym and we’re doing something and I say, ‘Andre, I don’t like you doing it like this – let’s try it this way,’ he says, ‘OK, let’s try it that way,’ ” Rogers said. “For me, it makes it fun to come to work every day with all these bright ideas about how to improve his game, both offensively and defensively, because I know he’s willing to accept change to get better.” Rogers could sense Drummond making progress through August and September last season as his conditioning level began to catch up to his athleticism and Arnie Kander worked on improving his functional strength. But it wasn’t until the few weeks before training camp began in October, as the majority of veterans arrived for pre-camp scrimmaging, that Rogers first felt certain Drummond could contribute as a rookie. “There were moments when it was just the two of us back in the gym, no one there, we’re just working out, and I could see the improvements day by day,” he said. “But I really didn’t get excited-excited until we came back as a unit in mid-September and you watched his growth from Summer League to now. You could just see his explosiveness in getting up and down the court, going after rebounds, blocking shots, and I started to think, man, this is a carryover from what we’ve done this summer. “That was just scratching the surface. We only had a few months, because he had some soreness in his back that limited us, but it made me really excited just seeing what we had done in the summer and how it carried over to our off-season games.” That back soreness, muscle fatigue, is unrelated to the current stress fracture of the fifth lumbar vertebra that will sideline Drummond into the middle of March, approximately. Assuming Drummond comes back without complications, as team doctors expect, Rogers is already eager to further refine Drummond’s athleticism in the off-season ahead. Among the items on Rogers’ checklist will be identifying one or two bread-and-butter moves with Drummond’s back to the basket. “In order to be a back-to-the-basket player, all you need is one or two things with his size,” Rogers said. “We work on it every day, but it’s not so simple. It takes years of repetitions before you become a back-to-the-basket player. I think back to how long it took me to develop a jump hook. It took five, six years before I was comfortable enough to shoot it in a game situation. We work on it every day and he’s shown signs of throwing the jump hook in games, but he’s still not comfortable. It takes thousands and thousands of repetitions before it becomes a reaction where you catch the ball in a game and you go and do it.” But as Rogers has come to know about Drummond, he has a way of shortening the learning curve. “You talk about the leaps and bounds he’s made this season,” he said. “When we watch a video from teams we played early in the season and we look at him now, he just laughs. Because he can even see the progress he’s made. We’re talking about half a season and he can see the progress he’s made from the beginning of the season until now. And I look at him and tell him, there’s so much more you can achieve this season.” Drummond, now idled for more than a week, is handling his down time as well as could be expected, Lawrence Frank said as the Pistons left for the All-Star break. “He’s learning what it takes,” Frank said. “This is a first go-around for him. The focus, effort, energy you put in to getting better is the same work you put in to be a better player. It’s dealing with that and listening to (trainers) and the doctors in terms of the proper pace to go at in regard to his rehabilitation. He’s chomping at the bit, which can turn into a good thing. By the time we get him on the floor, he’ll be extremely excited to touch that hardwood again.” True Blue Pistons",Raw Data
864,"CRISTIANO RONALDO faces Manchester United this week with Sir Bobby Charlton insisting Old Trafford is the place he is appreciated most. Ronaldo takes on his former club for the first time since his world-record 80million move to Real Madrid, in the Champions League last-16 first leg in the Bernabeu. And United legend Charlton, now an Old Trafford director, makes no secret of the fact that he would love to see Ronaldo, 28, back at his club. Sir Bobby said: I love Cristiano. I was really, really sorry when he left us but we couldnt stop him leaving. Playing for Real Madrid was something he had to do in his football life. But I always wonder what sort of treatment he is getting at Madrid and whether he can match what happened at Old Trafford and the affection that was shown to him. They loved him at Old Trafford and still do. People are asking me, Is there any chance, if Real Madrid fall out with him, that maybe we could bring him back? I always say, well, well have to wait and see. He is a great footballer and we will enjoy playing against him. Ronaldo has been even more prolific at Real than he was at United and the fact that he is now set to face the club where he became a global superstar adds further spice to what is an exciting two-legged tie. Charlton says of the battle between two of the most famous clubs in the world: When the draw was made it sent a shiver down my spine. My first introduction to European football really was watching Real Madrid with the likes of Alfredo Di Stefano and Francisco Gento. We learned so much. Madrid gave us so much, really. We have always had an affection for each other. If I have to do something to do with Real Madrid, then I would do it. Can I think of a bigger club match in football than Real Madrid v Man United? The answer is no unless you maybe involve Barcelona. They have a sense of adventure about them. Real and ourselves are the two biggest-supported clubs in world football. Its fantastic, it will be a great contest. I think it could come down to who is lucky at the time with injuries and suspensions. But Real have always had the right approach to the game. They are determined to have the best players no matter how much they cost. They seem to have everybodys affection. That probably comes from them winning the first five European Cups that was frightening. But we learned how to handle them and we werent totally beaten by them. We had our moments and maybe we will have more moments in the next two matches against them, starting in Madrid on Wednesday. Charlton is happy to talk in glowing terms about Real Madrid but has always been reluctant to discuss their manager Jose Mourinho (left) in similar terms. Mourinho has been touted as a potential successor to United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Perhaps that is why Charlton claims Mourinho sometimes tries to sell himself. But Sir Bobby, recognised as Englands most famous footballer, said: Alex respects people in the game if they have made a contribution and rightly so and Mourinho has. Theres no way I can put the record straight on Mourinho because I dont really know him that well. I will leave all that to Alex. What I know is that Alex is the greatest manager that there has ever been. Who am I to say what Mourinho is going to do? I dont know I suppose it takes all sorts. What Charlton is confident about is that Mourinhos Madrid and Fergies United are about to produce a Champions League classic. He just wishes Ronaldo was wearing red in these two games, rather than white.",Raw Data
865,"﻿Jovan Belcher, a starting linebacker for the Chiefs, murdered the mother of his child shortly before 8 a.m. Saturday. He hopped in his car, drove to the Kansas City Chiefs practice facility, thanked Romeo Crennel and Scott Pioli — and shot himself in the head in front of his coach and general manager around 8:10 a.m. Within two hours, the NFL instructed the Carolina Panthers to travel to Kansas City as scheduled in preparation for Sunday’s noon kickoff. By 3 p.m., the Chiefs announced that Crennel and team captains had decided to play Sunday’s game as planned. Short of terrorist attack and weather disaster, nothing slows the NFL. A 25-year-old kid gunned down his 22-year-old girlfriend in front of his mother and three-month-old child, and all he could think to do in the immediate aftermath is rush to thank his football coach and football employer. Belcher’s last moments on this earth weren’t spent thanking the mother who raised him or apologizing to the child he would orphan. His final words of gratitude and perhaps remorse were reserved for his football gods. It should come as no surprise that Crennel, Chiefs players, Pioli, owner Clark Hunt and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell quickly agreed not to delay Sunday’s football congregation at Arrowhead Stadium. We remember those who died in the sports world in 2012. Football is our God. Its exaggerated value in our society has never been more evident than Saturday morning in my adopted hometown. There’s just no way this game should be played. Twenty-eight hours after witnessing one of his starting linebackers take his life, Crennel will stand on the sideline as young men play a violent game. Twenty-eight hours after one of their best friends killed the mother of his child and himself, Chiefs players will take the field and play a violent game. Football is a game of emotion. Football is a game in which the coaches and players preach about treating each other as family. How can they play Sunday? Why should they? Belcher and his girlfriend didn’t die in a car accident 30 minutes away from Arrowhead Stadium. This isn’t some tragedy Crennel and Pioli heard about. Belcher crashed his car through the gates of the Chiefs practice facility. He pointed a gun to his head in front of Crennel and Pioli. He killed himself within a quarter of a mile of Arrowhead Stadium, where the players and coaches work. I just don’t get it. And I’m not trying to vilify the Chiefs for choosing to play Sunday’s game. It shouldn’t be their decision. Roger Goodell should’ve made this call. Crennel, Pioli and Kansas City players are justifiably still in a state of shock. You may argue that we all grieve differently. You may argue that playing the game is the best way to move on and heal. You may argue that canceling or delaying the game would serve no purpose and would be unfair to the fans who traveled to Kansas City to see Cam Newton and the Panthers play the Chiefs. I would argue that your rationalizations speak to how numb we are in this society to gun violence and murder. We’ve come to accept our insanity. We’d prefer to avoid seriously reflecting upon the absurdity of the prevailing notion that the second amendment somehow enhances our liberty rather than threatens it. How many young people have to die senselessly? How many lives have to be ruined before we realize the right to bear arms doesn’t protect us from a government equipped with stealth bombers, predator drones, tanks and nuclear weapons? Our current gun culture simply ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in the ultimate tragedy, and that more convenience-store confrontations over loud music coming from a car will leave more teenage boys bloodied and dead. In the coming days, Belcher’s actions will be analyzed through the lens of concussions and head injuries. Who knows? Maybe brain damage triggered his violent overreaction to a fight with his girlfriend. What I believe is, if he didn’t possess/own a gun, he and Kasandra Perkins would both be alive today. That is the message I wish Chiefs players, professional athletes and all of us would focus on Sunday and moving forward. Handguns do not enhance our safety. They exacerbate our flaws, tempt us to escalate arguments, and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it. But we won’t. We’ll watch Sunday’s game and comfort ourselves with the false belief we’re incapable of the wickedness that exploded inside Jovan Belcher Saturday morning.",Raw Data

One of the longest-running sagas of the offseason ended Tuesday, when the Washington Nationals and free-agent first baseman Adam LaRoche reached agreement on a two-year contract. Where did 2012's top free agents land and who's still available? The deal, first reported by the Washington Post and confirmed by a major-league source, gives LaRoche and the club a mutual option for a third year. LaRoche, 33, had sought a three-year deal coming off a season in which he finished sixth in the National League MVP voting. But his market was limited by the qualifying offer that he received from the Nationals, subjecting him to draft-pick compensation. The Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles both showed interest in LaRoche, but were unwilling to part with a high draft pick, sources said. The Red Sox now appear more likely to finish their deal with free agent Mike Napoli, who agreed to terms on Dec. 3 but has yet to officially sign because of an issue with his physical. See which players and managers will work in a new city in 2013. The Nationals’ re-signing of LaRoche dramatically increases the chances that the team will trade left fielder Michael Morse, who is now without a spot in the everyday lineup. An earlier trade for center fielder Denard Span pushed Bryce Harper to left, and Jayson Werth will return in right. LaRoche produced career highs with 33 homers and 100 RBI last season, and his .853 OPS was his best since 2006, when he was a member of the Atlanta Braves.

869,"There was a time, before Buster Douglas erased his aura of invincibility and before prison eroded his skill and will, when boxers feared, avoided and melted in Iron Mike Tysons presence the way golfers weakened in Tigers shadow before Thanksgiving 2009. TWO SIDES OF LEBRON LeBron James is building his legacy off the court, Bill Reiter says. This all came to a head for Tyson in 1988, his 35th professional fight. He stormed across the ring and eviscerated a quivering, previously undefeated, 31-year-old heavyweight champion Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. Spinks never fought again. Tyson became a legend, the baddest man on the planet and arguably its most famous. Two months after the Spinks fight and just seven months after his first marriage, Tyson and Robin Givens sat down with Barbara Walters on 20/20 and gave us our first significant glimpse into the price of evoking that kind of fear, legend and fame. A decade later, Tiger Woods Mike-Tysoned the golf world, winning the Masters by 12 strokes, provoking widespread panic throughout golf clubhouses and launching his legend and fame to the outer reaches of our imagination. Like Tyson, Tiger lost whatever level of sanity he possessed inside the maze of sex, obscene wealth, dishonesty and fawning, my-way-or-the-highway relationships created by seemingly unchecked and unchallenged power and fame. Does this fate await LeBron James? Let me clarify. I dont know anything about LBJs personal life. That is not my point. My point is that he is like Tyson and Tiger a child phenom who is in the early stages of dominating his sport the way Tiger and Tyson once did. LeBron is separating his level of performance from his peers and inspiring the kind of awe and fear that Tyson did in the 1980s and Tiger did in the 2000s. Just three short weeks ago, I argued that my Indiana Pacers, led by the baby dragon Paul George, might pose a serious challenge to James and the Heat. Other noted NBA watchers and pontificators, including Bill Simmons, sang the same tune. Ive watched nearly every Pacers game since the All-Star break. You cant see it yet in their record theyre 7-2 since the break but the Pacers are melting under the heat of expectations. Im not optimistic about Sundays showdown with the Heat in Miami. George is relying on his jumper too much and declining to consistently attack the basket and get to the free-throw line. Indianas bench, always a weakness, is regressing. Indianapolis Star columnist Bob Kravitz appears to be right the Pacers needed to make a move (J.J. Redick) at the trade deadline to strengthen their bench, especially now that Danny Grangers knee is sore again. The lack of a deadline move indicates that Pacers management believes LeBron is too good to be challenged right now. The Pacers will wait. But its not just the Pacers. Look at the Clippers. They won 17 straight games in late November and all of December. They were the talk of the league. Expectations jumped on their back and, after a 25-6 start, theyve gone 19-14 since. No way this should happen with Chris Paul and Blake Griffin on the same roster even with Vinny Del Negro as coach. The Knicks? Its not just the blistering three-point shooting that has disappeared. The Knicks cant get it together because Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire are not committed to figuring out to how play together. The truth is, Melo is comfortable with it being LeBrons league. If he wasnt, hed shave 10 pounds and two percent body fat, move to small forward and challenge King James. Maybe the Thunder are serious. But I wont believe it until I see Russell Westbrook consistently play the right way, which might only happen when/if Kevin Durant musters the courage to put Westbrook in his place. LeBrons peers are conceding. His contemporaries are ducking him. Theyre uninterested in doing whats necessary to beat him. LeBron is reaching a different kind of Tyson Zone, not the one Simmons has made famous, the one in which it is possible to believe any and every bizarre story uttered about a celebrity athlete. This Tyson Zone revolves around an athlete becoming so dominant, so supremely skilled and focused above his peers and so hyped that hes feared. CONTACT JASON WHITLOCK If you have a question or comment for Jason, submit it below and he may just respond. Subject: Comment/Question: Name: Email Address: Hometown: It is rare for a great athlete even the greatest to elicit fear from his contemporaries, peers and opponents. Joe Frazier wasnt afraid of Muhammad Ali. Neither were Ken Norton and George Foreman. Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Clyde Drexler and Reggie Miller lived in Jordans shadow, but not in fear of it. The Isiah Thomas-led Pistons bullied Jordan and delayed his ascension. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird shared many characteristics trepidation of the other was not one of them. At the highest level of athletics, fear is rare. The kind of ego it takes to reach the top leaves precious little room for anxiety, awe or doubt laced with a touch of cowardice. The great ones are like Marlo Stanfield from The Wire. They want to wear the crown, and they pursue it ruthlessly knowing full well the consequences of its weight. Sounds like one dem good problems, Marlo responded famously when his elderly mentor warned him of the burdens that come along with sitting at the head of the table. Prison and graveyards full of boys who wore the crown, the mentor retorted. Point is they wore it, Marlo said. Its my turn to wear it now. Does anyone besides LeBron really want to wear the crown?

AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. The forgotten “Ray” on the Baltimore Ravens quickly ceded the podium to quarterback Joe Flacco during a news conference Wednesday. Running back Ray Rice has been deferential when it comes to the spotlight as the imminent retirement of the face of the franchise, Ray Lewis, receives much of the media's glare leading into Sunday’s AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots. Rice is just as accommodating on the field. “Stats and all that other good stuff, we put that off to the side,” Rice said at the Ravens’ training facility. “One thing about our group is that we’re very unselfish. Very unselfish. It doesn’t matter who gets the job done.” That’s not something always heard from a franchise running back, especially one who signed a five-year, $40 million contract last offseason. Rice saw fewer carries (and receptions) during the regular season than a year ago. The fewer touches are linked to an offense that struggled during stretches — leading to the late-season firing of coordinator Cam Cameron — and the emergence of rookie Bernard Pierce as another option in the backfield. Rice still managed to rush for 1,143 yards in the regular season and was a Pro Bowl for the third time. He can be just as explosive when called upon. (He rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown on 30 carries Saturday in a double-overtime victory at Denver.) Check out the FOXiest fans from stadiums across the country and tweet us your photo. “He’s still making plays,” Ravens receiver Jacoby Jones said. “That’s all I can see.” In the final two regular-season games and against Indianapolis and Denver in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Ravens have averaged 450.8 yards of total offense — nearly 100 yards better than Baltimore’s regular-season average. The Ravens' 459-yard average in the playoffs ranks second to only the San Francisco 49ers. The difference could be in Jim Caldwell’s stewardship as offensive coordinator, although Rice said there was something else to their recent success. “We as players decided that we had to execute at a high level,” Rice said. “It’s our responsibility. One thing Coach Caldwell has done is that he let us go out there with a game plan. Regardless of the situation, we stick to it.” And a more cohesive offensive line that gives Flacco time to find deep threats such as Torrey Smith, Anquan Boldin and Jones as well as opens holds for Rice and Pierce doesn’t hurt. Feed your NFL addiction! Come feast on all the news in our updating blog. “That’s where it starts,” Flacco said. “Those guys are playing well, and we’re playing well as an offense. Those guys have really stepped up.” The Ravens are 6-0 in franchise history when they have a rusher reach the 100-yard mark in the playoffs. (Rice accounts for two of those.) Rice was held to 67 yards in last season’s AFC title game against the Pats, a game the Ravens dropped 23-20. It’s pretty clear that while reaching the century mark in the past has assured a playoff victory, Rice cares little how a win and the franchise’s second Super Bowl berth is attained. “We have been through a lot of adversity this year,” Rice said. “To overcome the things we had to overcome, to be counted out and then to be back in the AFC Championship Game — you don’t get here by accident. We believe in each other. We go out there and play for each other.”",Raw Data

Curry, of course, is the point guard for the resurgent Golden State Warriors, a fourth-year pro whos averaging 20.9 points and 6.6 assists, and shooting 45 percent on three-pointers. Most folks will tell you Curry is the main reason the Warriors have gone from spending nearly a decade in the dumps to a real threat in the Western Conference. Yet it was forward David Lee, not Curry, who snapped Golden State's 16-year drought Thursday, becoming the team's first All-Star since Latrell Sprewell in 1997. Now, nothing against Lee, whos been a major factor for the Warriors this season as well. He certainly deserved a spot. Even Curry said so. ""Congrats to my bro @Dlee042 representing #DubNation in Houston, Curry posted to his Twitter account, in reference to Lee. Proud teammate. Lets go. Others, however, were less thrilled with Lee being the only Warrior who was voted in as a reserve by the West coaches. Charles Barkley told a national television audience he was so angered by Currys omission that my heads about to explode. Warriors backup point guard Jarrett Jack tweeted, I really need to take a deep breath so I won't say something I'm not supposed to. And Warriors fans everywhere felt like theyd been kicked where it counts twice. But the trouble here is deciding who shouldve been left out. Joining Lee as West reserves were Spurs center Tim Duncan and point guard Tony Parker, Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook, Rockets guard James Harden, Trail Blazers forward LaMarcus Aldridge and Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph. Hard to overlook anyone on that list. All are top-flight players from playoff-contending teams. Meanwhile, not all reserves in the East can make that claim with the 76ers Jrue Holiday and Cavs Kyrie Irving joining the Heats Chris Bosh, Knicks Tyson Chandler, Pacers Paul George, and Bulls Joakim Noah and Luol Deng. Holidays team appears unlikely to make the playoffs unless Andrew Bynum eventually makes his Philadelphia debut, then stays healthy and plays with some serious passion. Irvings team lost 32 of its first 43 games. Yet Holiday and Irving are making their first All-Star appearances (as are George, Noah, Harden and Chandler). Keep in mind that the reserves, again, are selected by coaches, who cant vote for players from their own teams. What actually may have hurt a guy like Curry the most? Well, the fact that fans select the starters. In the West, the starters are Dwight Howard (Lakers), Blake Griffin (Clippers) and Kevin Durant (Thunder) in the frontcourt, and Kobe Bryant (Lakers) and Chris Paul (Clippers) at guard. In the East, its Kevin Garnett (Celtics), Carmelo Anthony (Knicks) and LeBron James (Heat) in the froncourt, and Dwyane Wade (Heat) and Rajon Rondo (Celtics) at guard. Now, the Lakers and Celtics are both traditionally strong franchises with huge fan bases. But do those two teams, given their first-half disappointments, really deserve to have two guys apiece starting? The fans say yes. The coaches would probably tell you no. Curry and others like him Clippers guard Jamal Crawford, Hawks forward Josh Smith, and so on can only sigh. This isnt intended to trash the guys who made it. In the East, Holiday and Irving are two of the most dynamic guards in the game. Irving, in particular, makes for good TV. And thats what All-Star weekend is all about. Plus, he can really play. Earlier in the week, Celtics coach Doc Rivers admitted he voted for Irving although Rivers made it clear it wasnt easy, considering the Cavs record. In the West, not enough coaches made that difficult choice to include Curry. Difficult, of course, because there were so many other worthy candidates. Still, of all the possible reserves out West, Curry is widely considered one of the two or three best, and certainly one of the top seven. Yet hell be at home, just like the rest of us, when the rest of the stars are taking center stage.",Raw Data
873,"Brad Friedel made his first start in a month as Tottenham booked their place in the knockout stages of the Europa League with a 3-1 against Panathinaikos at White Hart Lane. Needing just a draw to progress, Spurs had an air of complacency about them in the opening period, which Panathinaikos controlled for large parts. Emmanuel Adebayor put Tottenham ahead just before the half hour, but the Greeks, who have never won in Britain, played the better football and deservedly equalised through Zeca just after the re-start. Panathinaikos, knowing victory was their only means of qualifying for the knockout stages, threw everything at Tottenham and looked the more likely to score before Clint Dempsey - whose shot went in after hitting both the bar and keeper Orestis Karnezis - and Jermain Defoe settled the game late on. First Dempsey's header home Kyle Walker's cross made it 2-1 and Defoe killed the game off with his 13th goal of the season with seven minutes left. It was hardly Tottenham's most vintage performance of the season - and the game itself was largely poor in quality - but Andre Villas-Boas will sleep easier tonight knowing his team are one step closer to lifting the cup that he won with Porto in 2010. Lazio's drubbing of Maribor means Villas-Boas' men qualify second from Group J, with a potential Champions League drop-out awaiting them in the second round. The raucous chanting from the travelling Panathinaikos fans provided the only entertainment in the opening stages as both teams started slowly on a bitterly cold night in north London. Panathinaikos had only beaten an English team once in their history, but they looked the more likely to break the deadlock in the first 15 minutes. Toche, whose goal earned Panathinaikos a point in the reverse fixture two months ago, sprinted on to an Ibrahim Sissoko through-ball, but he mis-controlled the pass and Brad Friedel gathered easily. The Spaniard then slipped his marker to meet Giourkas Seitaridis' cross, but he could only shoot weakly at the Spurs stopper. Spurs were struggling to get into the game and were missing the influence of Gareth Bale, who was absent due to a hamstring injury. Like many of Tottenham's games in the Europa League, the contest was not proving to be the best advert for the competition, but all of a sudden Adebayor put the hosts ahead. The Togo marksman spun off his marker to collect Dempsey's through ball and slot the ball past Karnezis after a cushioned touch. Tottenham still struggled to get out of first gear despite the goal. Indeed, Panathinaikos came back at the Londoners through Toche, who beat the offside trap but Friedel raced off his line to claw the ball away. Sandro and Defoe both cleared the bar with wayward shots as the half drew to a close and Tom Carroll then slipped in Adebayor, but his shot was blocked by Kostas Triantafyllopoulos. Tottenham came out a bit brighter in the second half and were unlucky not to score their second three minutes after the re-start. Dempsey fed Defoe with a clever pass, but the England striker's shot struck the foot of a post before bouncing to safety. Panathinaikos then stunned the home side with a 54th-minute equaliser. Poor marking from Walker allowed Zeca to meet Nikos Spyropoulos' cross and he beat Friedel with a clinical header. The 1,816 away fans rejoiced and Lazaros Christodouloppulos emerged from the bench to give the visitors an extra outlet up front. The Greeks, willed on by their vocal support, continued to pressure Spurs, who were playing some of their worst football of the season. Kyle Naughton's frustration got the better of him as he put in a rugby-style ankle tap on Sissoko to earn a booking. Tottenham failed to clear a routine Panathinaikos cross and the ball fell to Toche, but he shot wide. Jan Vertonghen put in a crucial header to clear Spryopoulos' wicked corner as the Greeks continued to pile on the pressure amid a tense atmosphere inside the stadium. Dempsey then settled the home fans' nerves with Tottenham's second. Completely against the run of play, Sandro earned a free-kick 25 yards out after a foul by Zeco. Walker swung in a deep cross from the set-piece and Dempsey's header struck the bar before bouncing in off the keeper. It proved to be Dempsey's last contribution to the game as he came off for Gylfi Sigurdsson. The American received a standing ovation from the home fans, but Villas-Boas instead decided to give the forward what looked like a tactical talking to on the touchline. Any hopes of an unlikely Panathinaikos comeback were dashed with seven minutes left when Defoe latched on to Aaron Lennon's pass and chipped the ball over Karnezis. The goals knocked the stuffing out of the visitors, but their fans continued chanting as a relieved Spurs team took their foot off the accelerator and claimed all three points.",Raw Data
874,"Kansas State, who beat eighth-ranked Florida before Christmas and took third-ranked Kansas to the wire earlier this week, should have marched into Hilton Coliseum and handed Iowa State its first home loss of the year. Well, if we’ve learned anything from the first three months of college basketball, it’s that the human polls mean very, very little in one of the most wide-open college hoops seasons in recent memory. At the end of a week in which the No. 1 team in the country, Duke, suffered a thrashing of historic proportions, Saturday saw third-ranked Syracuse drop an overtime stunner to unranked Villanova. It saw unranked Georgetown give fifth-ranked Louisville its stunning third straight loss. And it saw Kansas State get stunned at unranked Iowa State. Perhaps we need to make a few belated New Year’s resolutions in college hoops: Stricken the words “stunned” or “stunning” from our college hoops vocabulary. At some point this season’s upsets should be considered routine. Dickie V’s “unbelievable, baby!” shouts bely the point that anything is believable in college hoops this year. Realize the word “unranked” is merely a way that we like to build up the run-of-the-mill, almost expected upsets — exactly what Iowa State’s victory over Kansas State was — into a shocking, unbelievable, heart-stopping stunner. Pay more attention to the in-depth numbers. Because the numbers rarely lie. The number in question here: 46th. That’s what the college hoops advanced statistics website KenPom.com has Kansas State ranked, which seems a far cry from the Wildcats’ No. 11 ranking in the human polls. As for unranked Iowa State? It is 43rd in the nation, a notch above Kansas State, which seemed to indicate Saturday’s game would be a back-and-forth, til-the-last-minute struggle between two relatively equal — if utterly different in style — teams. That’s exactly what we got. Iowa State’s fast-paced offense, which currently has it ranked 11th in the nation in points per game, helped the Cyclones overcome their atrocious 10-for-22 free throw shooting. Iowa State dictated the pace to the slow, more physical Kansas State team, which ranks 155th in the nation in points per game but crashes the boards hard and slugs it out in the paint. Iowa State guard Chris Babb played all 40 minutes and managed to hold K-State’s Rodney McGruder, who’d scored 20 or more points in three of his first five Big 12 games, to only 13 points. The lanky, versatile Cyclone guard Will Clyburn simply dominated, scoring 24 points on 8-of-16 shooting, grabbing a game-high 10 rebounds, and confounding Kansas State coach Bruce Weber. “He plays point, he plays three, he plays four — he gets you in all different minds, and they spread you,” Weber said. “When they hit threes, they spread your defense, and that allows him to work. We couldn’t do a good job of containing him.” Saturday’s matchup could be seen as a big morale game for each team. Kansas State was coming off a heart-breaking four-point home loss against the in-state rival, Kansas, one of the best teams in the nation. Iowa State was coming off the egg they laid in Lubbock, losing by five to a middling-at-best Texas Tech squad. “Especially after the Texas Tech game, we were all down,” said Iowa State power forward Georges Niang. “We heard stuff from everybody about how we shouldn’t have lost to them… We (had) three straight wins, we got a little cocky, thinking we were hot stuff. Then we got brought right back down after we lost to Texas Tech and realized we gotta have that same fight every game rather than taking games off.” After the game, I asked Weber if the high ranking got in his players’ heads and contributed to their two straight losses. He shrugged. They were ranked 11th because they went on a winning streak. They would have been the same team if they’d dropped one of those early January games, or if they pulled if off earlier this week against Kansas. His answer seemed to be that reporters and fans put a lot of stock into the rankings, but coaches really don’t give a hoot: “I don’t know, maybe we didn’t deal with (the high rankings), but now we had a reality smack and we gotta get back at it.” What we learned from this game? Iowa State and Kansas State are both really solid teams who will likely slug it out for second place in the Big 12. (Nobody’s eclipsing KU.) Iowa State’s hard to beat at home, and its Texas Tech loss was likely an aberration, and Kansas State’s heading back to a more realistic place after being ranked 11th. “They’re a great team, they’re an experienced team, they’re very well-coached,” Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg said of Kansas State. “I love their offense. That stuff they run is extremely difficult to guard. They run hand-offs, constant motion and movement. It’s a little bit similar to how we play. We try to go out and play unpredictable basketball.” Let me pull out one word from that: “unpredictable.” We can try and make sense out of chaos all we went, try to put rankings beside each team so we can pretend to know which team is better and which team is best. But the wonderful part of this college basketball season so far is that nothing — nothing — is predictable. Kentucky and North Carolina are unranked while Villanova’s out beating two top-five teams in five days? Of course. Don’t spend your time ranking or predicting anything this year. Just lay back and enjoy the beauty that is college basketball’s utter unpredictability. Follow Reid Forgrave on Twitter or email him at ReidForgrave@gmail.com",Raw Data
875,"A week ago the Pistons were a 4-20 team sitting on a seven-game losing streak and it was tough, at least from a distance, to see signs of progress. I think they were getting a little bit better all the time, but in this league a little bit better still amounts to a lopsided loss occasionally because there are so many great players and so many excellent teams. There comes a point, if you keep pushing forward despite the adversity every team eventually is going to hit head on, where you become good enough to win games and maybe even win them regularly. It almost looked to me like in the first trip to New Jersey, the Pistons played like that kind of team. They lost – a narrow loss – but they certainly played well enough to win and they kept it together for nearly a full 48. You could just see, maybe good things were about to start happening. Then they came home to play Milwaukee and that win was a monumental one, the first game of what is now a three-game winning streak. Milwaukee is a good team. I think they’ll be in the playoffs. They’re well-coached under Scott Skiles and the roster was improved by John Hammond – only tweaked, but made better. They came in brimming with confidence. Heck, the Bucks had beaten the Lakers and the Heat within the past few days. Not only did the Pistons have to beat them on the court, they had to beat them in the confidence game – and they did just that. They never wavered in that game and Brandon Knight was terrific. Who knows? He might have taken a giant step that night toward really coming into this own as an NBA point guard. We all knew he could score and beat most guys up and down the floor, but he’s starting to make sensational passes with perfect timing and we saw that against the Bucks. That gave his team a lift which carried over to the New Orleans win, which was basically done without Brandon after he broke his nose in the early going against a team that fights you to the bitter end. To win that game showed me something, especially on a back to back and playing the seventh in nine days. You could tell these guys believed in what they were doing – clearly believed in their coach and believed in each other. Perhaps the best win of all, though, was the win at New Jersey in the return trip to the Prudential Center. That felt like the Pistons clearly deserved to win the game. To win it despite a 27-point second-half explosion by Deron Williams – they just kept their cool no matter what a genuine NBA superstar was doing to them – was proof to me that they now have the ability to hold it together and beat many teams in this league. Credit goes to a lot of people, of course, including the always-growing Greg Monroe, whose signature dunk over Kris Humphries and Keith Bogans showed the Nets, and maybe the rest of the NBA, that the Pistons aren’t going to be pushed around anymore. But you start by taking off your hat to Lawrence Frank. Here’s a guy who is demanding yet likeable and extremely well-respected everywhere you go in basketball. He knew what he wanted, he stayed the course, never made excuses and now he has his team clearly moving toward the kind of basketball he wants to see played. There will be more bumps in the road, to be sure, but now we have proof positive that this staff and this team can handle them. It’s exciting to watch them play these days. It’s not easy going through the rebuilding process and trying to change the culture, but Pistons fans should feel encouraged and excited – and I know many of them already do – that we can now see that happening.",Raw Data
876,"Jarmila Groth marked her first Fed Cup appearance for Australia with a shock win against French Open champion Francesca Schiavone as holders Italy shared the opening singles in their first round tie in Hobart. Groth, who represented Slovakia before taking Australian citizenship in 2009 by marriage, beat the world number four 6-7 6-3 6-3 to give Australia a great start before Samantha Stosur, runner-up to Schiavone in Paris last year, lost a titanic struggle with Flavia Pennetta to leave the tie poised at 1-1. The reverse singles and doubles take place on Sunday. ""It is one of the great wins for me and I am happy and excited,"" the 23-year-old Groth, who married Australian player Samuel Groth, said on the ITF's website. Surprisingly, the experienced Schiavone said she had been taken by surprise despite Groth being ranked 31st in the world. ""My level was not so high and she got right shots and played good,"" the 30-year-old Italian said. ""I'd never seen her play and I was passive a little bit and she won."" Groth's victory meant Italy were still searching for their first ever point against Australia in Fed Cup play when Pennetta walked on court to face world number five Stosur - a sequence of 16 consecutive defeats. Pennetta ended that run with a 7-6 6-7 6-4 victory in a match interrupted for an hour by rain. Stosur served for the first set at 5-3 but allowed Pennetta back to take the opener and although she levelled the match by snatching the second set tiebreak she was unable to post a first career victory against her Italian opponent. ""Any time you serve for the first two sets and lose, it is disappointing,"" said Stosur, who will face her Roland Garros nemesis in Sunday's first singles. The winner of the tie in Hobart will face the winner between Russia and France. Russia's big-name players failed to fire as they slipped to a 2-0 deficit against France in Moscow. Alize Cornet overcame an ankle injury to produce a spirited fightback and beat Svetlana Kunzetsova 3-6 6-3 6-4, to give the visitors the early lead before Virginie Razzano stunned Maria Sharapova, playing her first Fed Cup match since 2007, with a 6-2 6-3 win. Belgium moved a step closer to a place in the semi-finals as they took a 2-0 lead over the USA, beaten finalists in the past two years, in Antwerp. Yanina Wickmayer got the hosts off to the perfect start with a 6-1 7-6(6) win over Bethanie Mattek-Sands before world number two Kim Clijsters extended their lead with a 6-0 6-4 drubbing of youngster Melanie Oudin. The Czech Republic are also within striking distance of the last four as they took a 2-0 lead over Slovakia in Bratislava. Lucie Safarova was made to work hard, in the first set at least, for her 7-5 6-1 win over Daniel Hantuchova before in-form Petra Kvitova, an Australian Open quarter-finalist last month, beat Dominika Cibulkova 6-2 6-3.

877,"SUPER-SUB NANI DRIVES MANCHESTER UNITED PAST READING ABOVE: Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates Nani's goal Manchester United 2 Reading 1 19th February 2013 By Kevin Francis SUPER-SUB Nani drove Manchester United into the FA Cup quarter-finals - days after being involved in a crash with a police car. The Portuguese winger hit top gear to shunt gritty Premier League strugglers Reading out of the competition at Old Trafford. He scored one goal and set up another in the second half of this fifth-round tie to show he had suffered no ill-effects from his crash. Nani's Bentley Continental was hit on Friday by an unmarked police car responding to an emergency call. Last night he came on as a replacement for Phil Jones, who injured an ankle in a 40th minute challenge from Jobi McAnuff. And he gave Reading an immediate sign of things to come by hitting the foot of a post with a 20-yard volley. Then, in the 69th minute, he took full advantage of a cracking Antonio Valencia cross to fire home a right-footed shot from 12 yards. Three minutes later he crossed for Javier Hernandez to head United further ahead and put them on course for a home lasteight tie with holders Chelsea or Middlesbrough. However, Reading threw a late spanner in the works when McAnuff made the most of Chris Smalling's failure to clear a ball in the box in the 81st minute. The Reading captain took advantage and slipped the ball home to give the visitors hope of claiming a replay, but they couldn't find an equaliser. United will be concerned by the injury to Jones, one of their outstanding players in the 1-1 Champions League draw with Real Madrid in Spain last week. He left the ground with his injured ankle in a protective cast and the big question is whether he will be fit enough for the second leg against Real. In the meantime, United's dream of a second Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup Treble is still on. But there is no doubting that last night they struggled for long periods against a very determined Reading. Their boss Brian McDermott showed where his priorities lie by making six changes from his side's last match at Stoke. The romance of the cup was clearly not on his mind as much as Premier League safety for a team that is currently third from bottom. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson also fielded a much-changed team, making eight alterations from the team that drew 1-1 in Madrid last week. Only Jones, David Welbeck and keeper David De Gea started, with Wayne Rooney not even in the squad. But United, clearly determined to stamp their authority on the game, almost took the lead after only two minutes. Hernandez had a shot blocked and then Valencia miskicked with the goal at his mercy. But Reading were far from overawed by the league leaders and attacked at every opportunity. One really dangerous free-kick from Noel Hunt was headed away after 20 minutes by United skipper Nemanja Vidic. But three Royals' keeper Adam Federici to prevent United from going ahead. He produced a marvellous double save to deny Tom Cleverley and then Ashley Young, who was later replaced by Robin van Persie as United pushed for the breakthrough. Australian Federici was in brilliant form, just as he was in the fifth round at Old Trafford five years ago. On that occasion he made a string of fine saves to secure an FA Cup replay. But despite all his super stops in this game it was Manchester United's night - thanks to that man Nani.",Raw Data
878,"Perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate the value of statistics and more specifically the value of looking at the right statistics is to look back at the track record of success of volume shooters in both the NBA and WNBA draft. And really we're not talking about the mysterious advanced statistical sorcery of magic wizards, but simple things like the percentage of attempted shots a player makes. Every year in both the NBA and WNBA draft, at least an exciting player at a major program fools a general manager into selecting them in the first round with a high scoring average that obscures a low shooting percentage. If they make the team/rotation, they get their chances to make an impression in their rookie year, eventually fall out of favor with the team that drafted them when they realize they were looking for actual points instead of attempted points, and then float around the pro basketball world as teams try to find a role for the player who was once such a promising scorer. Every now and then, you'll get an Allen Iverson, a player who seemingly shoots indiscriminately but is so dominant that he actually makes quite a few of the shots he takes. Similarly, sometimes you'll find a Riquna Williams whose inefficient volume shooting in college might also reflect a transferrable ability to create shot attempts, which can certainly be valuable in certain situations. Along those lines, sometimes a point guard will be look like a poor shooter simply because their college team demanded that they do it all: pass, score, and figure out when to alternate between the two during matchups, which is a valuable skill even if the statistics aren't perfect. But caveats aside, looking at scoring efficiency rather than scoring average tends to be the best way to separate WNBA prospects from non-prospects and the fact is that after you sort all of that out you're left with a very small pool of strong prospects. Statistics will never capture everything that counts: intelligence, leadership, maturity, and work ethic among other things can go a long way to overcome or undermine statistical indicators. But a large part of drafting well comes down to managing risk; nothing, even the exact quality of production of a consensus top pick, is certain in a draft context. Ultimately, the best general managers are able to look at a player's entire portfolio - film, statistics, and ""intangibles"" - and discriminate between the information that matters and that which is either irrelevant or less significant. The 2013 WNBA Draft is deep in the sense that there are a number of athletes who have been very productive and even elevated the profile of their college programs. But upon further scrutiny, one thing that really stands out is that a number of highly touted prospects entering this college season are productive in terms of averages yet not particularly efficient in terms of rates of production. And although every player and her fans wants to believe that she can create her own legacy, there is a historical record that of successful and unsuccessful profiles that is extremely useful in projecting the future success of a given prospect. Furthermore, as it turns out it's much easier to look back at the past and figure risk factors for an unsuccessful transition from college to the pros than vice versa - in other words, figuring out who probably shouldn't be among the 36 players drafted is often much easier than figuring out exactly how much they will contribute to a WNBA team. Nevertheless, even in a draft that everyone considers deep, there are a number of statistical indicators that might help us separate great college players from great WNBA prospects and put prospects in tiers for a draft board rather than a strict rank-order hierarchy. The following are a few major statistical ""red flags"" that have limited NCAA Division I players' chances at a successful transition to the WNBA in recent years. Red flags for WNBA draft prospects Perimeter scorers with low shooting efficiency Some people like to harp on guards who can't shoot, but some of them are occasionally successful as described above. A harbinger for struggling to make the league is being a volume shooting non-point guard 5'7 or under who doesn't score efficiently. There is currently one notable exception in the league right now: Riquna Williams and a major reason for that is that she is just so athletic that she can continue getting her shots in the pros. As an extension of that, wings with 2-point percentages under 46% tend not to be very successful prospects, although there were two rookie exceptions just this past WNBA season: Williams and Natalie Novosel. Another exception coming out of college was Karima Christmas, who now has a championship ring. There's potentially an adjustment that helps to explain that, but we're not going to disprove a rule with exceptions for now - Christmas and Williams had physical attributes that helped them overcome the poor shooting and Novosel played limited minutes on the worst team in the league. It's not common for a wing to enter the league with a low 2-point percentage and succeed. Examples from the 2012-13 senior class: Sugar Rodgers, Georgetown; Nicole Dickson, Memphis; Whitney Hand, Oklahoma Poor rebounding guards A large part of the reason why inefficient scoring tends to hurt perimeter scorers differently from other positions is that they tend not to contribute in other ways if they can't score: point guards can run an offense and pick up assists, post players can get rebounds. Nevertheless, although we typically don't expect guards to come into the league and contribute much on the boards, really poor rebounding wings (under 3% offensive rebounding percentage) tend not to do all that well. Again, point guards are a major exception to that although rebounding helps those that meet the other criteria. What poor offensive rebounding - especially in conjunction with a low free throw rate and sub-point guard assist ratio - tends to say about a guard is that they're limited athletically in terms of their ability to impact a game. Example from the 2012-13 senior class: Alex Bentley, Penn State; Lindsey Moore, Nebraska Low usage rates For all we want to talk about how the WNBA is about fundamentals and teamwork, the draft record pretty clearly reflects that players with low usage rates in Division I basketball don't tend to be very ""successful"". Typically, falling under a usage rate of 18% at any position limits a players chances for WNBA success (with an exception for centers because their ability to score at a high rate typically depends on the efficiency with which their guards get them the ball). The reason for this might seem obvious at first: if you can't easily create a shot for yourself and aren't a point guard (who can create shots for others), you become a liability to an offense at the next level. However, that doesn't quite explain why low usage players (guards especially) struggle to even get drafted: it might be equally plausible that players with low usage rates don't stand out to scouts because they don't score much or get knocked for being passive. In any event, we can probably add some nuance to the shot maker vs. shot taker dichotomy: between inefficient shot-takers and efficient ""limited shot takers"" (players with low usage percentages), the former might have an advantage in terms achieving success. There are a number of potential explanations for that that have little to do with how much a player contributes to her team, by the way but non-shot takers outside the point guard position could almost be considered non-prospects. Examples from the 2012-13 senior class: Jenny Ryan, Michigan; Kelly Farris, UConn; Taelor Karr, Gonzaga; Haley Steed, BYU; Adrian Ritchie, Wisconsin - Green Bay Post players with low offensive rebounding numbers It might be obvious why this one becomes a red flag: offensive rebounding is a skill distinct and more significant than defensive rebounding for draft prospects in the NBA and WNBA for what it represents as much as generating a second shot. There are a lot of tall players who get defensive rebounds simply by being tall and typically positioned near the basket in an advantageous position to get to the ball. Offensive rebounding, in contrast, takes a combination of athleticism, basketball IQ, instinct, a whole bunch of neurological stuff, and most of all effort. So tall post players (even 6'3"" and above) who don't get a high percentage of offensive rebounds sometimes struggle to meet expectations at the pro level because one of those things isn't present. Examples from the 2012-13 senior class: Carolyn Davis, Kansas Power forwards 6'1 and under I know this one sounds arbitrary and with wingspan mattering more than ""top of the head"" height it sounds misguided. Yet the fact remains that college power forwards 6'1 and under simply aren't very successful prospects and those that are were very efficient scorers in college (2-point percentages of 52% and above). Even then, the track record for success isn't all that strong: only five college power forwards under 6'1"" lasted the season on WNBA rosters last season and one - Danielle Adams - is something of an anomaly because she was such a good passer and 3-point shooter in college. This flag isn't so much about success vs non-successful as much as quality: Adams and Sophia Young are obviously prime examples of players who have overcome being undersized to carve out a niche for themselves, but players like Alysha Clark and Ashley Walker have struggled to even make teams. Where it really does become a matter of roster-worthiness is when undersized power forwards weren't very efficient scorers in college. Examples from the 2012-13 senior class: Destiny Williams, Baylor; Morgan Stroman, Miami Centers with true shooting percentages under 55% Centers are an interesting bunch of prospects because a lot of what they do offensively depends on their guard play. So if they're not efficient scorers, a major question for them appears to be whether they can help the team in ways other than scoring. That's where their value added rating comes in, which is their Model Estimated Value minus their points scored. Centers with a value added rating over 2.22 tend to do well even if they are inefficient scorers. Since 2005, there are three examples of value added being a protective factor for a player with a low true shooting percentage coming out of the NCAA: Nicky Anosike, Janel McCarville and Krystal Thomas. In other words, inefficient scoring centers have a pretty tough time making the league. Examples from the 2012-13 senior class: Kelsey Bone, Texas A&M Inefficient ball handling ESPN's John Hollinger has made the point in his NBA draft rater that low pure point ratings are actually a red flag at any position (adjusted by position) and that tends to be the case in the WNBA as well though looking at why a player has a low pure point rating tends to be important. For point guards, not having a high pure point rating is a problem to begin with so dropping into negative numbers is obviously a bigger problem. For wings, the problem with a low pure point rating should be obvious: for players who end up in position to dribble and pass the ball more often, a low pure point rating reflects some combination of poor ball handling, passing, or decision-making ability. A wing that can't dribble or pass efficiently is going to be a limited player at the next level. But sometimes a high turnover ratio isn't a bad thing for a wing prospect: for high usage players, high turnover ratios can simply be a function of the player's aggression attacking the basket. Similar to what has been mentioned previously, when they get to the pros and are asked to create less the turnovers become less of a problem. Post players with low pure point ratings (less than -6.00) are a bit more complicated - sometimes got those numbers because they played big minutes and didn't get a lot of assists meaning they had considerably less weighted assists than turnovers. However, that's not quite as big a problem as a post player who has a low pure point rating because they do in fact turn the ball over a lot (a turnover ratio of 15% and above). In addition, high usage post players sometimes turn the ball over simply as a function of getting more opportunities than they really should - with less touches in the pros, suddenly turnovers are less of a problem. Still, a low pure point rating is a red flag that can limit a player's success even if they do end up making a roster and tends to be hard to ignore. Examples from the 2012-13 senior class: Chelsea Poppens, Iowa State; Morgan Stroman, Miami; Markel Walker, UCLA; Kevi Luper, Oral Roberts; Jasmine Dixon, UCLA (2011); Chucky Jeffery, Colorado; Davellyn Whyte, Arizona Mid-major players People are obviously skeptical of mid-major players for good reason, but since 2005 about 50% of Division I mid-major players drafted have actually stuck on a roster for a season (25 of 48, which is a bit less than the rate of major conference players albeit there have been 250+ of those). Yet over the last five seasons, only six mid-major players have lasted on a roster for two seasons and only two (Amber Holt and Leilani Mitchell) have been a full-time starter at any point in that time. So what should we make of mid-major statistics? If mid-major lottery picks like Amber Harris and Courtney Vandersloot have struggled and only one has made it as a full-time starter as a rookie (Holt), should we just ignore them? The one thing that really stands out about mid-major players is that they have been hurt by the 11-player roster limit - in terms of making rosters - more than almost any other large category of player (another category would be 3-point specialists, who are essentially non-existent in the league after the roster limit was imposed). A lot of those 25 that made rosters in their draft year didn't last more than a season. Most have bounced around. The last mid-major All-Star drafted was Candice Dupree. But there's another angle on the mid-major prospect that can't be ignored: the last two seasons have been a testament to the value of patience with players coming from less prominent programs. Jessica Adair, Alysha Clark, Natasha Lacy, and undrafted Avery Warley are all examples of mid-major players who weren't immediately successful prospects but worked on their games overseas and returned to be solid rotation players. Ultimately, the discussion of mid-majors is simply worth a separate article, which we'll get to later. But it's safe to say that some adjustment should be made for mid-major statistics. So are all these players just non-prospects? Just as yesterday's statistics were presented with a caveat about those being junior year numbers, every single one of these should be taken the same way - although each of the players listed above has a weakness that would be a concern if they were being drafted today, the fact is that they have a full senior season to improve upon those weaknesses (and reinforce strengths). But looking at the junior season numbers in depth like this is useful: in addition to providing some idea of what specifically to watch for throughout the season among those who might have their names called on draft day, it gives us a baseline from which to gauge improvement. Some of these statistical observations may indeed indicate low ceilings for some of these players, but the reason these players are listed above instead of the hundreds of others who have statistics that make them a non-prospect is that even marginal improvement upon their weaknesses is almost certain to improve their status on draft day. On draft day, it will come down to general managers weighing a prospect's strengths and weaknesses and figuring out whether she can succeed in their system.",Raw Data

880,"Hi, folks! Now that I’ve recovered from my end-of-season hangover, it’s time to hand out some fantasy football awards for 2012. The votes from our esteemed panel have been meticulously counted, and … ah, that’s a lie. I’m the only voter. Let’s get going. MVP: Adrian Peterson, Vikings All Day, baby! Peterson was solid over the season’s first six weeks, averaging 83 yards per game. “Pretty good,” you thought if you owned him. After his ACL surgery, it was about all you could have reasonably expected. From Week 7 onward … holy $#@! Purple Jesus ran for 1,598 yards and 10 touchdowns over his final 10 games, and finished the season with 20 percent more fantasy points than the next highest running back (Doug Martin). If Peterson isn’t the top overall pick in your league next season, then your league includes at least one idiot. Best Bargain: Alfred Morris, Redskins Morris didn’t really emerge as the Redskins’ primary ballcarrier until the season opener. He looked good in preseason, but fantasy footballers had misgivings about Mike Shanahan’s history of running back roulette, and kept wavering between Roy Helu, Evan Royster and Morris. As a result, Morris’ ADP was 146.8, close behind such luminaries such Jahvid Best, Felix Jones and Rashard Mendenhall. Once the season started, “Alf” never looked back. He became the seventh-ranked rusher in FOXSports.com standard leagues, scoring 256.7 points on 1,610 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Morris carried 335 times in 2012, so there’s not much reason to think he’ll slow down next season, unless you believe that the potential absence of RGIII could negatively impact him. Shanahan has juggled before, but he ran Terrell Davis a lot, too. Best Breakout in a Supporting Role: C.J. Spiller, Bills Spiller finished sixth among running backs in FOXSports.com standard scoring despite getting only 250 touches (207 carries, 43 receptions). Of the five guys that scored more fantasy points than Spiller, the next-lowest was Jamaal Charles with 320 touches. If new Bills’ coach Doug Marrone gives Spiller a lead dog’s workload in 2013, he could be a monster. RGIII was seventh in QB scoring, thanks mainly to breathtaking running ability that garnered 847 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. How will he bounce back from what is apparently a serious knee injury? ACLs aren’t usually career-threatening any more, and Adrian Peterson came through similar surgery like nothing ever happened. However, Peterson’s recovery was very quick. Stay tuned. Martin’s status as fantasy’s second-best running back was a bit skewed thanks to a ridiculous Week 9 performance against the Raiders that netted 60.2 fantasy points – 19 percent of his total for the season. However, he’s still a no-doubt first rounder in 2013 as an every-down back for the Bucs. There was a lot of pre-draft hype surrounding Martin in fantasy circles, and he eclipsed all of it. Better Late Than Never: Knowshon Moreno, Broncos After a lost season in 2011 made it seem like his career was headed nowhere, Moreno entered 2012 no better than third on the Broncos’ depth chart behind Willis McGahee and Ronnie Hillman. When McGahee got hurt in Week 11, fantasy wiseguys were all over Hillman, until John Fox announced Moreno as the starter less than 90 minutes before the Week 12 game in Kansas City. Moreno was terrific from then on, averaging 97 yards rushing and 18.5 fantasy points per game in Weeks 12-16. Watch your free-agent pool, folks – even on Sunday mornings. You never know what you’ll find. Biggest Bust (non-injury): Larry Fitzgerald, Cardinals It’s hard to feel bad for a guy who makes millions of dollars and spends his offseasons traveling the world, but Fitzgerald deserves better than the cadre of horrible quarterbacks his team has foisted upon him since Kurt Warner left. Fitz’s ADP was 13.8, and he was the second wideout off the board on draft day. That made sense to me, as he caught 80 passes for 1,411 yards and eight scores in 2011 with Kevin Kolb and John Skelton under center. He was QB-proof, right? Not so much. Fitzgerald hit rock bottom (we hope) in 2012, with 71 receptions for 798 yards and four touchdowns, thanks to the scattershot arms of Kolb, Skelton, Ryan Lindley and Brian Hoyer. He went through one five-game stretch in which he caught 10 passes for 89 yards, and found himself languishing on fantasy benches. We’re not asking you to get Aaron Rodgers, Cardinals. An average Joe would probably be enough to return Fitz to fantasy WR1 status. Biggest Busts (injury): Darren McFadden, Raiders; Maurice Jones-Drew, Jaguars; Greg Jennings, Packers DMC and MJD were the sixth and seventh runners, respectively, to come off fantasy draft boards. McFadden missed four games with a sprained ankle, ran for just 707 yards, and was 25th among running backs in FOXSports.com standard scoring. He might improve in 2013, but if you bet on a breakout again, remember that his fragility is likely to disappoint you. After a training camp holdout, Jones-Drew missed most of the final 10 games with a foot injury that required surgery. If healthy, he can return to workhorse status, and might be a bit of a bargain in 2013 drafts. Jennings’ ADP of 21 reflected a belief that he would bounce back from a subpar 2011 that was marred by a sprained knee. An abdominal injury slowed Jennings this time, causing him to miss eight games in the middle of the season, which he ended as fantasy’s 76th most productive wide receiver. Maybe he’ll provide production as the lead option on a new team next year, but if he’s healthy, some fantasy hype is likely to surround him in July and August. When I considered Gates before the season, I thought: Old, fat, slow. Maybe the middle assessment was harsh, and as colleague Mike Harmon noted on one of our podcasts, the Chargers’ lack of good receivers drew much of opponents’ coverage to Gates. He caught just 49 passes for 538 yards, surpassed 60 yards only once, and finished 13th at his position in fantasy scoring. The best tight end our fake game has ever seen is now just a matchup play. You never could completely trust Vick as a fantasy option, since he’s always been injury-prone. Now, his real-life status as a turnover machine is close to overshadowing his athletic ability, and hurting his prospects for playing time. A desperate team (J-E-T-S, JETS! JETS! JETS!) might take a shot at Vick, but I’ll take the under on 11.5 games played in 2013. At age 33, his fantasy value is likely to continue its downhill trajectory. Rivers’ passing yards declined by more than 1,000 from 2011 to 2012, and he finished the season as the 21st-ranked quarterback on FOXSports.com. Remember when he was a mid-tier QB1? No more. Best Late-Season Hero: Dez Bryant, Cowboys Bryant was the No. 5 wideout in fantasy scoring, finishing just a tenth of a point behind A.J. Green. That’s pretty amazing when you consider that his fantasy owners were unimpressed after Week 9, when he had an unspectacular 42 catches for 503 yards and two touchdowns through a half season. Starting in Week 10, Bryant emerged as a star. He racked up 50 catches for 879 yards and 10 scores in his final eight games, carrying many fantasy squads on his back (and with one hand!). You can pick Calvin Johnson ahead of Bryant in 2013. Maybe A.J. Green, too. Beyond that, I’ll take Dez, and you can have the field.",Raw Data
881,"He said: ""It was the desire of the club to sign me up which was the most important factor. ""It was nothing to do with the league position. It was really all about the club's desire and willingness to sign me up. ""Also, I like the club's ambition to strengthen the whole team so we can improve our league position. That's what appealed to me, so I didn't hesitate."" Toon boss Alan Pardew added: ""Massadio is very highly thought of in France and he's somebody who our scouting team have been greatly impressed by. ""At the age of 20, he will only continue to get better but he's already played a lot of games in his country's top division and represented France at under-19, under-20 and under-21 level. ""He's strong and quick and we're looking forward to seeing him develop here."" Yoan Gouffran, meanwhile, has embarked upon his Newcastle career confident relegation is not on the agenda. The 26-year-old striker signed a four-and-a-half-year deal at St James' Park after completing a move for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £1.4million, from Bordeaux. He arrived with the Magpies sitting just two points clear of the bottom three and facing a big game at fellow strugglers Aston Villa on Tuesday evening. However, Gouffran, who became Alan Pardew's third January signing after compatriots Mathieu Debuchy and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, is not at all concerned that that situation will persist. He said: ""I am not worried at all. I know the players who play here at Newcastle already. They are fantastic players. ""Newcastle isn't in the position it should be in the league. Whether it's myself or the other players in the team, we are going to try our utmost to make sure we can climb up the league to where we should be. ""I think with the players Newcastle have, we can realistically be aiming to finish at least in the top eight."" Gouffran's recruitment addressed one of the more pressing issues facing Pardew this month following the departure of leading scorer Demba Ba for Chelsea. Ba's goals have been seriously missed - the Magpies have scored only twice in the four games they have played since the Senegal international headed for Stamford Bridge - and with Papiss Cisse struggling for form, greater potency was a must as the manager drew up his wish-list. Having seen QPR counterpart Harry Redknapp gazump him to land first-choice frontman Loic Remy, Pardew will be relieved to have finally got a forward in, and the newcomer is confident he can be a hit on Tyneside. Asked what qualities he will bring to the club, Gouffran said: ""Speed. I am fast and I score goals."" Ba's return of 29 goals in his 18 months at St James' will be a hard act to follow, but Frenchman Gouffran is far from daunted by the task of attempting to follow in his footsteps and form a partnership with Cisse. He said: ""There's not really any added pressure. Yes, I am an attacker; yes, I want to score goals. But we [he and Ba] both have different styles of play. ""I don't really think it's fair to draw any comparisons between both of us. Each player has his own style. Each to his own. ""Papiss Cisse and I played against each other when he was at Metz in France, and he is someone who has really made a lot of progress here at Newcastle and he has scored some great goals. I had a chat with him this morning for the first time. We get on really well. He's a great guy and I have no worries that we can definitely play together well."" Meanwhile, Moussa Sissoko is also set to join the club from Toulouse, according to his club. The Magpies have been strongly linked with the 23-year-old midfielder, who is out of contract at the end of the season, and the player himself has spoken about his interest in a move to the north-east. And the Toulouse website has now released a statement which read: ""Moussa Sissoko has agreed with Newcastle United for a definitive transfer, that takes effect today. ""All the club wishes him continued success in his career.""",Raw Data
882,"Magic Johnson considered himself to be the adopted son of Los Angeles Lakers owner Jerry Buss. Shaquille O'Neal hailed Buss for his foresight, while Kobe Bryant cited Buss' ability to convince people to believe in him. Jerry West remembered a party-loving Buss who never went to bed, making it easy to be the first one at work in the morning. They were among the basketball greats gathered Thursday at an invitation-only memorial service to salute the life and legacy of Buss, who died this week at 80 after an 18-month struggle with cancer. The stage at the Nokia Theatre across from Staples Center was bedecked with all 10 of the NBA championship trophies won by the Lakers under Buss and more than 30 floral arrangements. Photos of Buss throughout his life flashed on a video screen. Johnson punctuated the 1 1/2-hour service by getting the audience on its feet, clapping and cheering for Buss. ''He didn't like it sad, he wanted it to be fun,'' Johnson said. O'Neal recalled Buss bringing him on the floor at the Forum in Inglewood and telling him to look up at the championship banners in the rafters. ''He told me, `Son, we expect big things out of you and some 18-year-old kid we just signed, Kobe Bryant,''' O'Neal told the audience, which filled about half of the 7,000-seat venue. O'Neal and Bryant certainly delivered, teaming to win three titles despite their personal discord. ''He gave me everything I wanted,'' O'Neal said of Buss. ''I wanted one extension, he gave it to me. I wanted a second extension, he gave it to me. I wanted a third extension, he traded me.'' Johnson told of arriving in Los Angeles and not knowing anyone as a 19-year-old drafted by the Lakers out of Michigan State. ''God knew I needed a father figure,'' he said, explaining how Buss quickly filled the role by taking Johnson to his first boxing match in Las Vegas, his first tennis match, and his first horse race at Hollywood Park across from the Forum. ''I said, `Dr. Buss, I'm a black man from Lansing, Michigan. We don't know anything about horse racing,''' Johnson said, drawing laughs. ''I went and enjoyed myself.'' Buss replied, ''The way you play basketball that man plays hockey. I want you to see the Magic man of hockey.'' But it wasn't until Johnson's 1992 public admission that he had HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, did he realize how Buss really felt about him. ''As we cried for hours, him not knowing I would be here 22 years later, he picked up the phone and started calling hospitals to make sure I had the best health care possible and the best doctors,'' Johnson said. ''That's when I knew this man cared for me outside of basketball, outside of making no-look passes.'' Among the other speakers were NBA commissioner David Stern, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Phil Jackson, Pau Gasol (who spoke in Spanish) and Pat Riley. Jackson, now engaged to Buss' daughter Jeanie, recalled the summer of 2008 when a fed-up Bryant went public with his trade demand. ''Jerry listened to the demands of Kobe and his agent,'' Jackson said. ''He said, `There's no equal value we can get for you.' He prevailed and we won two more championships.'' When it was Bryant's turn at the mic, he said the biggest summer for him was 2006 when Buss asked what he thought of Jackson returning for a second stint coaching the Lakers. Bryant was hesitant. ''He just looked at me and said, `Trust me,' and I did and that took us to another level winning two championships,'' he said. ''He had this ability to convince you to follow him.'' West first met Buss in 1979, having already worked for two previous owners of the Lakers, including Jack Kent Cooke, who sold the team to Buss. West had to get used to Buss' lust for life that included hard work and heartier partying. He recalled one celebration in which Buss had forgotten his credit card and asked West to pick up a tab that included $8,000 for champagne alone. Another time he was out with Buss and work ethic was being discussed. ''He never went to bed so how the hell could he not be the first one to work?'' West said. Johnny Buss, the oldest of the six Buss children, spoke on behalf of the family. He mentioned his father's penchant for wearing jeans cut off at the bottom. ''They would fringe and I caught him one time combing the bottom of the fringe,'' he said, suggesting that on every Jan. 27 - his father's birthday - people don jeans with the bottom cut off in Jerry's honor. The younger Buss provided insight into life with his father, who loved travel, wine, poker, books, classical music and movies. He called him ''a man who would take us on an incredible journey that no one could ever imagine.'' ''Not everything went right but because he was always thinking ahead, everything became right,'' Johnny Buss said. ''He never had to step on anyone to get ahead. He surrounded himself with good people. He loved L.A. and as we can see L.A. loved him, too.'' The audience included the current Lakers team, Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Bill Walton, former Lakers coach Rudy Tomjanovich, former Lakers Byron Scott, A.C. Green and Cedric Ceballos, retired Los Angeles Sparks star Lisa Leslie, former Southern California athletic director Mike Garrett, longtime Lakers fan Dyan Cannon, and Los Angeles Kings broadcasters Bob Miller and Jim Fox. The speeches were interspersed with performances, including nine members of the USC band playing ''Amazing Grace.'' Randy Newman, whose iconic ''I Love LA'' anthem is played at every Lakers game, sang his hit ''You've Got a Friend in Me'' from the movie ''Toy Story.'' Davis Gaines sang a number from ''Phantom of the Opera.'' Johnson ended the memorial with a plea to Buss' six children who control a majority stake in the team. ''Please Buss family, do not ever sell the Lakers, and win more championships,'' said Johnson, who owns a share of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Buss is to be buried Friday in a private service.",Raw Data

Hamilton yesterday unveiled the new Mercedes W04 he hopes will take him to the front of the grid this season. But he knows he is taking a step into the unknown after leaving McLaren, the only team he has ever driven for. Hamilton said: ""This year is about one step at a time. Finish the first race, getting on the podium, then trying to win races. This year is about trying to get ­settled in the team, get a good working relationship and steer this car in the right direction  and next years car. We have to deliver as a team, of course, but I am not a miracle ­worker.

Hamilton, 28, won four races last ­season, while Mercedes have only won one in the past three years. ""It wont be until the next couple of days that I get a feel for it and understand in which direction to push the car,"" said Hamilton. ""Im going in with an open mind, a blank sheet. I dont know what to expect. I just hope it has lots of downforce."" Hamilton and new team-mate Nico Rosberg raced karts together as ­teenagers before graduating to F1. ""Im sure it will work, said ­Rosberg. It worked well in go-karting for two years, so there is no reason why it cant work well again in F1. We were always up front battling for podiums and wins. I dont see why it cant be the same here, in that off the track we get on well, then have a big competition on track.""",Raw Data

""There is an improvement, a big one,"" Maldonado told reporters in the paddock at the end of the day. ""It's a step forward. ""We have good data here from last year so I confirmed a step in performance. The car seems to be very comfortable on the track. ""I'm very happy because it's the best car I have [driven], especially in the first test. ""Last year's car was good, competitive all through the year, but I think there is a clear step forward on this car."" Maldonado added that the car felt nothing like his race-winning FW34 at the same track last year. ""It's completely different,"" he said. ""A completely different car, a different feeling. ""It seems to be more easy to drive, but easy doesn't mean quick, so we need to wait a little bit to get to the bottom of the car. ""Last year, a couple of times the car was very difficult but at the same time very quick, so it's difficult to compare."" AUTOSPORT says F1 editor Edd Straw (@eddstrawf1) Pastor Maldonado's comments on the new Williams FW35 sound relatively run of the mill - good step forward, positive step, upbeat etc etc - the usual new car launch platitudes. But the way the Venezuelan delivered his lines leaves you in no doubt as to his sincerity in feeling that this car is very promising indeed. To see him grinning and bouncing around the paddock served only to intensify that impression. Maldonado knows what a good car feels like at Barcelona having won here last year, so his positive attitude is to be taken seriously. Everything we've seen from Williams over the last year suggests that under technical director Mike Coughlan, it has a good handle on exactly what it's trying to achieve and the improvement in detail work on this car compared to its predecessor is clear. We can take Maldonado at his word when he says it's a step forward but the key question is whether it's a relative step forward. But all the evidence so far suggests that making the top five in the constructors' championship remains a realistic aim. After the usual equivocations about needing more time in the car, I asked him what his gut feeling was and whether the car was capable of challenging for race wins. His response lacked the usual downplaying of expectations and made his feelings very clear. ""I think I'm going to enjoy it with this car during the season...""",Raw Data

889,"– Greg Monroe, logging heavy minutes as the Pistons endured their first game without Andre Drummond available due to his back injury, finished with 26 points, 16 rebounds and five assists as the Pistons snapped San Antonio’s 11-game win streak with a 119-109 win. The Spurs, playing without Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili, fell behind by 21 points in the second quarter but cut it to 13 by halftime and got it into single digits in the third quarter before the Pistons re-established a 17-point lead going into the fourth quarter. The Spurs again got as close as seven, but the Pistons kept the pressure on by continuing to pile up the points. Their previous season high was 119 points in their double-overtime loss at Atlanta on Dec. 26. Brandon Knight added 24 points for the Pistons. BLUE COLLAR – The Pistons are a much different offensive team when Charlie Villanueva’s 3-point shot is falling. It was falling against the Spurs as Villanueva scored 21 points and hit 5 of 9 from the 3-point arc, including two big ones in the fourth quarter as San Antonio crept within seven points. But Villanueva also did some work on the defensive end, too, helping Greg Monroe on the glass by picking off eight rebounds and playing solid defense. RED FLAG – Andre Drummond’s remarkable rookie season has been interrupted with a stress fracture to his fifth lumbar vertebra that is expected to keep him out for four to six weeks. Drummond initially reported back pain after Sunday’s game with Los Angeles, then sat out the next second half on Monday at New York when he said he couldn’t get loose. After four minutes on Wednesday, culminating when he took a charge and fell on his tailbone, Drummond came out of the game. An MRI exam on Thursday revealed the injury. Andre Drummond is as important to the Pistons’ future as Tim Duncan has been to San Antonio’s past. Just as their careers were poised to intersect for the first time, the grind of the NBA season intervened and cost both the chance to suit up at The Palace on Friday. Drummond will miss at least the next four weeks and possibly longer. The injury – a stress fracture of Drummond’s fifth lumbar vertebra – poses no long-term threat, team physician Dr. Benjamin Paolucci said Friday. As the Pistons digested that distasteful news, they at least left The Palace with a good taste in their mouth – a 119-109 win over San Antonio, playing without Duncan (knee) and Manu Ginobili (hamstring), snapping the Spurs’ 11-game winning streak. The ripple effects of losing Drummond included extended time for Greg Monroe, who responded with 26 points and 16 rebounds in 40 minutes. Lawrence Frank shortened his rotation, using only Charlie Villanueva up front behind Monroe and Jason Maxiell. Will Bynum and Rodney Stuckey were the only perimeter backups to Kyle Singler, Brandon Knight and Jose Calderon. “He’ll be fine,” Frank said of Drummond, who sat behind the bench in street clothes, smiling and interacting with his teammates as the Pistons tied their season high for points scored. “No one wants to get injured. Any sort of negative situation, you turn into a positive. Andre’s going to be able to work to get stronger and take his time to gain some strength to make sure his back gets healed correctly for the long term. “We’re going to miss Andre. Andre is a vital part of our present and future, but that’s the name of the game. We move forward, we get him healthy and you go with who you’ve got.” Monroe’s monster game aside, it was Villanueva who really saw his role change and responded well. He logged 33 minutes and scored 21 points, both season bests, and matched his previous high with eight rebounds and two blocked shots. “He was great,” Monroe said. “He was doing what he do – knocked down some big shots, made some tough ones, helped out rebounding. With the loss of Dre, a lot of people are going to have to step up, especially the fours and the fives, and tonight Charlie did a great job.” Frank is prepared to use Slava Kravtsov as the backup to Monroe, but the Spurs – playing without a traditional backup center with Duncan out – didn’t really afford him a matchup opportunity to use the Ukrainian rookie, who played a season-high 11 minutes on Wednesday when Drummond’s back cut his night short after four minutes and Maxiell got into deep foul trouble. And with Monroe rolling, Frank was going to ride him as long as he could last. A subtle change in Frank’s play calling allowed Monroe to break loose. “Early on, (Tiago) Splitter had some great post defensive possessions on Greg,” Frank said. “We wanted to move him up in the elbow, so we started to do it, whether it was with the pass or with the pick and roll to try to get some separation. I felt they were on his post game and just wanted to give him a little more space to operate.” The Pistons played at a faster tempo, coming closer to fitting the ideal Frank sees for a lineup that has added Jose Calderon and now includes four attacking guards. The Pistons compiled 26 assists, including eight – against zero turnovers – from Calderon and five apiece for Monroe and Will Bynum. “We’re a good team if we can work the pace with me and Kyle (Singler) running the wings, Jose pushing or me pushing,” Knight said. “We can do a pretty good job running the floor and get easy baskets.” “This is how we have to play,” Frank said. “We have to play an up-tempo game. We’ve got to take advantage of the face we have a two-headed monster at all times. Whoever gets the outlet, go.” Knight scored 24 points and kept San Antonio’s defense on its heels with his constant movement. “I just really loved Brandon’s energy today,” Frank said. “The effort he put into the game was huge.” That was an area of the game where Drummond frequently gave the Pistons a lift over the season’s first 50 games. His teammates are mindful of the need to keep Drummond mentally engaged during his idle time and equally aware of the void he leaves. “He’s definitely a big part of us,” Knight said. “What he does, even though he’s a first-year player, he helps us out a lot. He’s going to be missed. We wish him a speedy recovery, but we have to do our best to play without him.” “It’s a huge loss for us, what he brought to the table,” Monroe said. “Everybody knows they have to step up now.” Knight said he talked to Drummond briefly after he got news of his injury. “He’s always in good spirits, no matter what’s going on,” he said. “He’s a very positive guy. He’s always going to be good.” True Blue Pistons Drummond Idled",Raw Data

891,"Last season, Nashville Predators coach Barry Trotz had the luxury of going to the whip hand with his thoroughbred goalie Pekka Rinne — without the fear of wearing him out. In the early going, as his young team struggled to jell, Trotz rode Rinne hard to keep the Predators afloat. Late in the season, when he sensed that home-ice advantage for the Stanley Cup playoffs would be crucial – as it was in a first-round series victory over longtime nemesis Detroit – the veteran coach didn't shy away from playing his goalie too frequently. Rinne played in nine of the final 10 regular season games, making starts on back-to-back nights twice in that period and winning three of the four. For the second time in two seasons, Rinne was named a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, leading NHL goalies in wins last year (43). He ended up playing in 89 percent of the Predators’ games then leading the league in games with 73 (a franchise record). Suffice it to say that in this 48-game season, with its compacted schedule, a similar strategy could be risky — not only for the Predators but for almost any team in the league, especially if they want their No. 1 goalie fresh for the playoffs. Enter the Predators' old-new backup goalie, Chris Mason, who delivered a 3-1 road victory against the beefed-up Minnesota Wild on Tuesday. Mason made 29 saves and was named the game's first star to earn the Preds’ first win of the season. Mason told FOXSportsTennessee.com that teams will benefit this season from backup goalies who can contribute. ""I think it’s important, obviously,"" he said. ""I think it’s a nice option for the coach to be able to rest their guy and not feel like they’re giving a game away, and that’s kind of what my focus is this year . . . to be ready all the time and give the guys good goaltending when Pekka’s not in there — just so they’re not reluctant to do that and burn some of the guys out that are playing. ""If someone plays 42 games in a condensed season, it’s going to be tough on guys,"" said Mason. ""I think it’s definitely going to be a nice option for coaches to have if their second guy is able to step in and play well.” By signing a one-year deal with Nashville, Mason, who will be 37 before the season ends, is in his fourth city in four years: St. Louis, Atlanta, the franchise’s move to Winnipeg and now Nashville. He chose Nashville in part because of its record of playoff success – the team has advanced to the second round in each of the last two seasons – and he wanted to be a part of that. But it also helped that he had such familiarity with Nashville’s organization. On and off, he was with the Preds from 1998-2008 and still owns a home in Nashville. Ironically, it’s rented and he and his wife had to rent another, but, knowing the area, he knew where to find a good school district for his daughter, who began first grade in the fall. Mason knows the coaching staff, training staff and roughly half the players — including Rinne. If that translates into performances like Tuesday’s, both he and the Preds stand to benefit. They have games on back-to-back nights nine times this season — or 37.5 percent of their schedule. In addition, teams will play only within their conference this season and being one of the Eastern-most teams in the Western Conference, the Preds will slog through plenty of travel. Mason noted the condensed schedule has teams “playing every second night and flying all over the country.” If Mason can spell Rinne, the big Finn might have more ""jump"" for the playoffs, which Mason has not experienced since 2009. He was ""extremely happy"" with his performance on Tuesday, which occurred in Nashville's first game against former teammate Ryan Suter. “Yesterday, I was nervous just because I hadn’t played a game in eight months and the implications of every game seem to be pretty big this season with the shortened season,” Mason said. ""So it was great to get in there and help the team get some points. ""That's my job to get in and play those games and not just to give Peks a break, but to also try to get points and the guys played a great game in front of me, too.""",Raw Data
892,"ARSENE WENGER was close to meltdown as he hit out on the eve of his sides crunch clash with Bayern Munich. The under-fire Arsenal boss lost his cool at the press conference ahead of the Champions League last-16 tie. It was the angriest the 63-year-old has appeared in public, lashing out at claims he had been offered a new two-year deal by the struggling Gunners, who were knocked out of the FA Cup by Blackburn on Saturday. Wenger  who has been at the north London club for over 16 years  claimed the report was part of a conspiracy to undermine him and the club. He even turned on a journalist yesterday, asking him why he was staring at him as he gave his briefing. Why do you look at me? he demanded. Turning to the contract claim he added: Why does it just come out when we lose a big game? You think I am so naive that I dont see what is behind that? You think I am a complete idiot? I work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention  to harm. But Wenger refused to elaborate on why he felt the claim of a new contract  his current one expires at the end of next season  had emerged. Im more worried about the players, he added. I will go into the Champions League in a different situation. On top of that they have to fight against everybody and I want to protect the players to make sure they go into the game in a good condition. The lie is targeted to hurt. So I think morally that is wrong. Its easy to say people are not happy and on top of that say hes extending the contract. The Champions League represents Arsenals last chance of ending an eight-year trophy drought, after they crashed out of the FA Cup. Wenger alleged pundits were jumping on an anti-Arsenal bandwaggon, adding: There is a lot of superficial analysis. We have to accept we take the blame for going out, but you have to put things into perspective. Because one guy says one thing, everybody has to go the same way. The defeat to Rovers sparked loud booing at The Emirates and calls for Wenger to be sacked. But last night Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood turned on Wengers critics and insisted there was no way the club would axe him. You have your ups and downs and we are having a bit of a down, he told Starsport. But some of the reaction has been a bit hysterical. You hear clubs being criticised for sacking their manager too quickly. Now there are people out there calling for us to sack a manager who has been a huge success for 15 years. That does not help much. I have been extremely disappointed by some of the recent results. I have been an Arsenal fan for a lot longer than most so I think I know what it feels like. It hurts a lot and I am sure Arsene is hurting too. He is very diplomatic and calm but deep down he feels very strongly and he is as upset as anyone. Its not just me who is backing Arsene.

893,"United States manager Jurgen Klinsmann provided six reasons for American fans to follow the Mexican First Division — now called Liga MX — when he named his squad for last week's stunning 1-0 victory over Mexico at Estadio Azteca. Klinsmann leaned on a significant group of Mexican-based players to guide his side to that famous first victory at the Azteca: Michael Orozco Fiscal claimed much of the glory as he bundled home the winner ten minutes from time, but all five of his Liga MX colleagues – DaMarcus Beasley, Edgar Castillo, Joe Corona, Herculez Gómez and José Francisco Torres – featured at some stage and played their part in the historic win. The presence of those six players and several other Americans south of the border highlights the importance of Liga MX to the US efforts moving forward. It also provides more than enough inspiration to follow a league regarded as one of the best outside of Europe. Although the Mexican top flight started its season last month, there is plenty of time to catch up on the proceedings. Right now, it’s wide open: a number of clubs could secure the title at the end of the campaign. In order to ease the transition into Liga MX, FOX Soccer answers a few questions in this primer to introduce the league: Where do we stand at the moment? Liga MX splits the traditional season into two tournaments: the Apertura (or “opening” tournament, running from July to December) and the Clausura (or “closing” tournament, running from January to May). The 18 involved clubs play each other once to form the 17-game league slate. The top eight finishers compete in the playoffs (Liguilla) to determine the champion in each tournament. In addition, one club is relegated to the promotion league (Liga de Ascenso MX) after every season based on a points-per-game formula encompassing the previous four tournaments. This may sound confusing – and it is – but we’ll keep you abreast of the race at the bottom all season long. The 2012 Apertura campaign kicked off on July 20. Toluca currently enjoys a five-point lead at the top of the table after winning all five of their matches to date. Current champions, Santos Laguna, sit in the middle of the pack after a mediocre start to the season. Which teams are worth monitoring? Most of the attention usually swirls around Liga MX's two biggest clubs: C.D. Guadalajara and Mexico City-based Club América. América plays its home matches at Estadio Azteca and has used the ample resources provided by owners Televisa to compile an expensive squad. Guadalajara – better known as Chivas – employs a different approach by restricting its team to players with Mexican heritage. The two teams also share a rivalry called “El Súper Clásico.” While those two teams dominate the headlines, other sides collect trophies at a more frequent rate. Santos Laguna boasts the most consistent record of success as of late with the 2012 Clausura title in the trophy case and four other finals appearances in the past five seasons. Monterrey claims the highest international profile with two consecutive CONCACAF Champions League triumphs and an appearance in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup on its ledger. Tigres UANL, Toluca and UNAM Pumas have all won titles in the past five tournaments to underscore the competitive nature of the league. If someone asks me about Liga MX, which names should I drop? Start with a couple of key figures from the under-23 squad that recently won gold at the Olympics in London. Former Fulham and PSV defender Carlos Salcido (Tigres) featured as one of three over-age selections to the team and remains a key figure in the national team setup. Exciting prospects Marco Fábian (Chivas) and Elías Hernández (Tigres) could soon join Salcido in the full team on a more permanent basis and perhaps seal a move to Europe in the process. Foreign clubs have also expressed interest in taking midfielder Héctor Herrera (Pachuca) and over-age striker Oribe Peralta (Santos Laguna) overseas since the Olympics concluded. Even if some of those players depart, Liga MX will still boast plenty of stars. Monterrey striker Humberto Suazo rates among the top finishers in the Americas based on his exploits in Mexico and with the Chilean national team. Club teammate and Mexican international Aldo Di Nigris and Ecuador international forward Christian Benítez (América) aren't too far behind in that particular pecking order. Mexico regulars Pablo Barrera (Cruz Azul) and Efraín Juárez (América) recently returned from Europe to add to the significant delegation of domestic-based players in José Manuel “Chepo” de la Torre's squad. Former captain and stalwart Gerardo Torrado remains as combative as ever in the center of the park for Cruz Azul. How are the Yanks doing? As Klinsmann's faith in this particular group of players suggests, they are doing pretty well indeed. Gómez (Santos Laguna) heads the delegation by supplying a regular stream of goals for his successful club side. Experienced winger Beasley continues to play an integral role for Puebla despite the club's financial problems. Orozco-Fiscal merits a regular starting berth in defense for San Luis. Castillo and Corona ply their trade for Club Tijuana, the wonderfully dubbed “Xolos” (a nickname plucked from the small hairless dogs endemic to Mexico). Torres (Pachuca) completes the contingent, though the midfield schemer has started just three of five matches this season for his club side. Several other players – including former US international Jonathan Bornstein (Tigres) and Greg Garza (Club Tijuana) – will hope to emerge from the reserves to claim more regular match action and nab a place on Klinsmann's radar in the near future.

894,"Suzy expensive Favor. Just did them. And the NCAA will be proud to know Suzy definitely went pro in something other than sports. STUNNING TRUTH See Suzy Favor Hamilton's career as a three-time Olympian and a high-priced escort. Suzy Favor Hamiltons name demands jokes. And her story, that of an attractive married mother, three-time Olympian and motivational speaker who spent the last year escorting men for $600 an hour, has every metric for a big Google splash attractive, blonde, sex, scandal, B1G, Olympian, prostitution. So, of course, Twitter was ablaze with Suzy Favor Hamilton talk almost instantaneously. What is funny is it was mostly by people who, before Thursdays Smoking Gun story, had no idea who Suzy Favor Hamilton was. Being a whore, um escort, gave her more fame than being an Olympian ever did. My first thought when my bosses asked me to weigh in was this is another example of athletes struggling with handling adversity because being an athlete meant they rarely had to do so. This is BS, though. The reality is I am so sick of Suzie Favor Hamilton and her many incarnations Bobby Petrino, Tiger Woods, Kristen Stewart. Bill Clinton, David Petraeus, Kobe and on and on. All of y'all bore me with your selfishness. It is not newsworthy to be a Dear Abby cliche a selfish cheater willingly putting your immediate gratification ahead of your kids and families. We have spent a whole week talking about hugging our kids more tightly, about being reminded of what really matters, of nothing being more important than family. This is so very our society right now, to focus on the once-in-a-lifetime tragedy and ignore the daily tragedies we are creating in our own lives through infidelity, through financial irresponsibility, through selfishness. Is the Favor Hamilton scandal slightly less salacious when you realize she had a husband? A kid? It is not quite so funny when you realize the collateral damage she inflicted. I recently read a line about parenting in ""Daring Greatly"" by Brene Brown that struck a chord with me. Suzy Favor Hamilton fell to the ground during the women's 1500-meter final at the 2000 Olympics after slipping toward the back of the pack. Shaun Botterill The question isnt so much, Are you parenting the right way? as it is: Are you the adult that you want your child to grow up to be? This has to be a resounding no for Favor Hamilton. Say this for the former Olympian, she did not bother with The Cheaters Handbook, Athlete Edition deny, deny, deny, then radio silence, then a very public stop by rehab for sex addiction followed by a forced apology, then basking in whatever fame comes from this scandal. Favor tweeted in quick succession a long, very personal explanation of guilt, of why, of shame, of sorrow. @favorhamilton: I realize I have made highly irrational choices and I take full responsibility for them. I am not a victim here and knew what I was doing. @favorhamilton: I was drawn to escorting in large part because it provided many coping mechanisms for me when I was going through a very challenging @favorhamilton: time with my marriage and my life. It provided an escape from a life that I was struggling in. It was a double life. @favorhamilton: I do not expect people to understand, but the reasons for doing this made sense to me at the time and were very much related to depression. I very much believe her. I do not know her particular demons, but we obviously have a broken individual here, a woman willing to sacrifice the love and respect of her daughter and her husband, friends and family, for $600 she did not need and sex that brought shame. There is an old adage about you are only as sick as your secrets. And anything based in lies and deception is likely to be bad for you. There is a bigger point here, bigger than how a seemingly decent former athlete finds herself in Vegas and L.A. using an alias and prostituting herself. There is an emerging trend of athletes seemingly unable to deal with off-field adversity and unwilling to ask for help. TOP SEX SCANDALS From Mike Tyson to Tiger Woods, take a look at the biggest sex scandals in sports. Just recently, Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent did not call a cab. Chiefs wide receiver Jovan Belcher did not seek help for what reports say were escalating depression issues. Favor Hamilton trying to heal herself at $600 an hour. @favorhamilton: As crazy as I know it seems, I never thought I would be exposed, therefore never hurting anybody. @favorhamilton: I have been seeking the help of a psychologist for the past few weeks and will continue to do so after I have put things together. @favorhamilton: I cannot emphasize enough how sorry I am to anyone I have hurt as a result of my actions and greatly appreciate the support of my family @favorhamilton: and those closest to me. I fully intend to make amends and get back to being a good mother, wife, daughter, and friend. I am sure she means all of it. And I hope she does.

895,"Even in a season thats had as many heartbreaks as this one for the Pistons, almost all of them due to the crushing stretch of injuries, a night like we had at The Palace this week with the Pistons Care Telethon just makes you feel good to be a part of the Pistons family and a member of the Michigan community. I thought the Pistons Care Telethon that raised more than $400,000 and counting was an absolutely smashing success. Anybody who thought that there werent enough Detroiters with the means to help out our less fortunate now know better. And anybody who thought the Pistons werent relevant anymore obviously was sadly mistaken. All the radio stations, all the TV stations, the great crowd at The Palace, the terrific response on the telephone and over the Internet clearly shows that when the Pistons have an event, its a happening in Detroit, southeast Michigan and all over our state. This is clearly a victory for our area and for Michigan. So many of the hungry will now be taken care of because of this unbelievable event. You have to give Alan Ostfield a great tip of the hat. Hes certainly watched this event unfold for the last couple of years, but this time it was all his. The way it was organized, with the different levels of prizes for participation and the goals that were set, were all very realistic even in these tough times and Alan should really take a bow. So should all the people who work at The Palace who were involved in this event and I know that was virtually everybody who works at The Palace. I was proud to be one of the up-front guys, but the real work was done by the people who got in at 6 in the morning and worked at least until midnight. Theyre the heart and soul of the Pistons family and they should all take a bow. The fans who turned out also got treated to a really good NBA basketball game, too, against one of the teams everybody had pegged as a title contender coming into the season. Ive always respected the Boston Celtics. They were a terrific rival for the Pistons throughout the years. Back in the Bad Boys days, the Pistons had to go through Boston to get to a championship. The Celtics had their runs in between titles when they were trying to find a way to get back and they finally did. They have a tough and smart group of players and theyre extremely well-coached by Doc Rivers. Their only problem is Father Time. The question wont be answered for a while, but has Father Time caught up with them? You can do an awful lot in the postseason on guts and guile and basketball IQ, but I dont think you can take that all the way to a championship. If they dont get their legs back under them and I dont think they have them right now I just dont think you can consider Boston one of the favorites. When you shift gears to Cleveland, a team the Pistons will see this Friday night and then two more times in March, as well as to Atlanta and Orlando, youre talking about young legs. Whoever would have thought Orlando was going to get all the way to the Finals last year? But now they can say theyve been there, done that. I dont think theyll shy away from the bright lights of the postseason. The Hawks have been right there, surprising Boston when they took the Celtics to seven games the year Boston won it all, and then last year beating Dwyane Wade and company before playing Cleveland tough. So theyre not a team you want to tangle with in the postseason. They really do have talent and they, too, are well-coached by ex-Pistons assistant Mike Woodson. But I do believe Cleveland is the favorite. LeBron is playing at an unbelievable level. Hes every bit as good as people feared he would be if they werent wearing wine and gold. Hes an unselfish teammate, he has brute strength, range on his shot hes virtually unguardable and he makes that team go like maybe no other team in the NBA. The Cavs do have to get settled in at all the rest of their positions before the postseason. Shaquille ONeals return from njury and the possible return of Zydrunas Ilgauskas they could be a lethal tandem if its handled properly. Managing their minutes, depending on the matchups and situations, is going to be critical for Cleveland. Theyve also had injuries in their backcourt. So theyll have to polish up their rotation, but if and when they do and I believe they will I make them the favorite to win it all.",Raw Data
896,"MADISON, Wis. Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan didn't need to be reminded that point guard Traevon Jackson hadn't exactly been dazzling anyone with his shooting this season. He also didn't need to be told that the sophomore would work overtime at honing his craft so he could succeed the next time an opportunity arose. ""You have to work at what you do,"" Ryan said. ""When you are presented with the moment, there can't be any doubts. You have to be the one that says, OK, we can do this.' "" As the shot clock hit four seconds and the game clock six seconds with the game tied at 43 on Saturday, Jackson didn't have any doubts he was going to get off his shot. As the ball rattled between the side and front of the rim and the backboard, he didn't have any worries that it wasn't going in. And when he was mobbed by his teammates at half court following the final buzzer, Jackson had no problem saying how big Wisconsin's 45-44 victory over No. 12 Minnesota was for the Badgers' psyche. ""This was a must-win game,"" said Jackson, who scored UW's final two baskets. ""You got to take care of home court when you get a chance to."" It was the slowest game of the Big Ten season, with only 51 total possessions, but it was the biggest for Wisconsin (14-6, 5-2 Big Ten) in terms of regaining a foothold in a tight conference race. It was even bigger for Jackson and his maturation process. Jackson was on top of the world 11 days ago as he and his teammates flew home from Bloomington, Ind. A few days after scoring a career-high 14 points against Illinois, Jackson displayed even more poise and confidence during Wisconsin's 64-59 victory over then-No. 2 Indiana. But in the next two games two losses that sent Wisconsin from first place to a tie for fourth in the conference Jackson made three of 19 shots, committed six fouls and beat himself up for not playing with the same confidence. Before Saturday, of the eight players who had started for Wisconsin this season, Jackson had the worst shooting percentage (.333) and second-worst 3-point percentage (.231). Despite ranking fifth on the team in minutes per game (23.8), Jackson had the second-most fouls on the team, including four against Michigan State that gave him a look of bewilderment each time an official blew his whistle. That wasn't the case against Minnesota, as Jackson scored six of his nine points in the final 7:02, committed only one foul and admitted he was hunting for his shot during a game in which neither team led by more than two points in the final 10 minutes. ""I felt that I needed to step up and hit the shots,"" Jackson said. ""I don't have any fear."" Wisconsin's final two possessions were the definition of fearlessness. With a little more than a minute remaining, Jackson crossed over in front of Trevor Mbakwe and hit a pull-up at the free throw line. The crossover worked so well on Mbakwe that he did it again one possession later, using a shot fake to get Mbakwe out of position and releasing the shot with less than a second left on the shot clock and 2.1 seconds left in the game. ""A lack of discipline,"" Minnesota coach Tubby Smith said of Jackson's final shot. ""He shot fakes [and] we jump out of the way, a mistake. That's how you get beat when you make the mistakes we've been making. That's a recipe for getting another loss, not being disciplined defensively."" It was just another late-game problem in a series of them for Minnesota (15-5, 3-4), which has lost four straight to overshadow its first 3-0 conference start since the 1974-75 season. After Mbakwe's jumper with 3:53 remaining gave the Gophers a 43-41 lead, Minnesota didn't hit another field goal in its final five possessions, which included a shot clock violation and an offensive foul by Andre Hollins who had a game-high 20 points in the paint with 39 seconds left. ""I should've just gotten a shot up; that would've been the best,"" said Hollins, who didn't score in the final 6:28. ""In that situation, you've just got to get the ball to the rim. It sucks to not have a shot attempt at all and they come down to score. It was a big momentum changer in the game. My decision-making on that play was very poor. Those are the little things that cost us the game."" Minnesota had a chance to send the game to overtime after Mbakwe drew a foul with 1.7 seconds left but was unable to shoot after injuring his right wrist on the play. In his place, the Gophers sent Rodney Williams a career 57.9 free throw shooter to the line. Williams made the first but was too long on the second, allowing Wisconsin to secure the rebound and dribble out the clock. ""That's a tough situation,"" Ryan said in reference to Williams' free throws. It wasn't pretty on either side offensively for the entirety of the game, as the Badgers shot just 37.0 percent and the Gophers were worse at 34.8 percent. But with the game on the line, Ryan didn't stop himself from putting the ball in Jackson's hands, even though that role recently had been given to freshman point guard George Marshall. ""It was definitely a gut feeling,"" Ryan said. ""I've been coaching over 40 years with that."" It was a gut decision that could have a huge ripple effect for Wisconsin.",Raw Data
897,"In a recent Los Angeles Times story, Detroit Tigers outfielder Torii Hunter was quoted as saying his Christian beliefs would make it difficult and uncomfortable for him to accept an openly gay teammate. UNCOMFORTABLE Torii Hunter drew criticism after expressing his views about potentially having a gay teammate. Chris Kluwe, the Minnesota Vikings punter who has publicly advocated for same-sex marriage, criticized Hunters comment as bigotry. Others used social media to support Hunter, saying he was entitled to free speech. Me? I believe Hunters statement could prove constructive but not because I agree with him. In fact, I dont. Rather, Hunter has inadvertently provided baseball with the impetus to begin serious preparations for the sports next great social responsibility. One day, perhaps not long from now, baseball will have an openly gay player. And the only way for the sport to live up to its transformative legacy is to encourage a candid, informed discussion on the subject until that moment arrives. Hunter, a four-time All-Star with nearly 14 years of big-league experience, is one of the games most respected players. Because of his standing within the sport, and the frankness with which he expressed his viewpoint, his perspective needs to be handled differently than the juvenile incidents the sport witnessed during the past two years. Before a 2011 game in San Francisco, Atlanta Braves pitching coach Roger McDowell asked a group of fans if they were a homo couple and made sexual pantomimes with his hips and a bat. Last year, Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Yunel Escobar wore eye black bearing a homophobic slur. Each was rightly suspended for his actions. STRAIGHT TALK Vikings punter Chris Kluwe and ex-teammate Matt Birk are outspoken on issue of gay marriage. Hunters case is different. He didnt make lewd gestures. He didnt use pejorative terms. He said this: For me, as a Christian I will be uncomfortable because in all my teachings and all my learning, biblically, it's not right. It will be difficult and uncomfortable. Hunter later said on Twitter that his statements were misrepresented, although he never denied the substance of the quotes. And if Hunter has been consistent in his application of moral guidelines to the lives of his teammates, he must be similarly uncomfortable with those who violated the Christian prohibition on any sex outside of marriage. But if we set aside the theological qualifier, were left with a 37-year-old professional athlete saying hes uncomfortable with the idea of playing alongside a gay teammate. Thats not the worst starting point for this discussion. Those trying to end homophobia in sports specialize in that evolution from uncomfortable to well, maybe to OK to comfortable. I dont think what he said is an uncommon feeling, said Patrick Burke, co-founder of the You Can Play Project, a leading group in the advocacy of rights for gay athletes. Thats something a lot of athletes feel just a little uncomfortable. They dont know what it means. They dont know the ramifications. They dont know how to react when they find out the teammate sitting across from them in the locker room is gay. In every league, the next step has to be the education of players. You have to talk athletes through it. The problem I always have is when athletes are asked about this, the question is, Would you support a gay teammate? Thats the wrong question. The right question is to point to a guy in the room, whos put up numbers for the past five years and contributed to a winning team. Well, hes gay. Now are you still uncomfortable? The answer is no. There has yet to be an openly gay player in the four major North American pro sports leagues, but the NHL has moved the furthest toward a culture of acceptance due in part to the numerous all-star hockey players who have appeared in the You Can Play Projects public service announcements. Hockey was a natural place for the outreach to begin. Burke works as a scout for the Philadelphia Flyers. His father, Brian, is general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Patricks late brother, Brendan, was the inspiration for the You Can Play organization itself; Brendan, who was openly gay, worked as a student assistant for the Miami University hockey program and became a forceful advocate against homophobia in sports before dying in a 2010 auto accident. Now baseball must nurture its own leaders on the issue, so our national pastime can properly support an out player. You Can Play is described as a collaboration of gay athletes and straight allies. In this instance, those allies need to be established, influential major leaguers. Candidates for that role may exist already. Greg Bouris, communications director for the MLB players union, said the association is exploring potential diversity training programs. A lot of individual players are very passionate about this issue, Bouris said in an email to FOXSports.com. We look forward to working with the players in the coming months to further develop these ideas. JACKIE ROBINSON'S LEGACY A hero's uncommon courage Each team's first black player Unsung: Negro League stars Satchel Paige one of a kind Look back on Paige's vivid life Last players to don jersey No. 42 Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig frequently invokes the sports standing as a social institution with important social responsibilities. The games greatest triumph came in 1947, when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and helped to change the racial attitudes of a nation. Baseball has a similar obligation to protect the professional rights of openly gay players, particularly when considering the current collective bargaining agreement expressly prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. The CBA language works as a leaguewide guideline, but this issue demands a leaguewide audience. Burke has met with MLB officials to discuss educational initiatives and the possibility of producing PSAs featuring major leaguers, but nothing has been finalized. The ball is in their court at this point, he said. Burke would love to speak with all 30 teams; so far, he has tentative plans to meet with only one this spring the Blue Jays, as a follow-up to the sensitivity training that went along with Escobars suspension last September. One active major leaguer told me this week that he believes some teams but not all of them would be receptive to You Can Play seminars this spring. I would do the minor leagues more aggressively than the bigs, he added. Theyre the next generation. Thats a logical view, in light of polling data that suggests younger age groups are the most receptive toward gay marriage rights and may have similarly tolerant attitudes about welcoming gay teammates. Yes, religion is an important consideration in this discussion. Many big leaguers are Christian, and the importance of faith to their lives is evident in the large number of them who attend Baseball Chapel services before Sunday games in every ballpark across the majors. But Christians arent monolithic in their attitudes toward homosexuality. One reason for that: Jesus actually says nothing about homosexuality or gay sex in the New Testament, according to Dr. Ellen Armour, professor of theology at the Vanderbilt University Divinity School and director of the schools Carpenter Program in Religion, Gender, and Sexuality. WHAT DID HE SAY? Watch the interview at Yardbarker in which former New York Giants WR David Tyree made controversial comments. Varied interpretations of other Biblical passages concerning homosexuality (mostly in the Old Testament, Armour said) have given rise to differing conceptions of the doctrine across Christian denominations. Thus, no one knows how many big leaguers would agree with Hunters statement that homosexuality is not right. Its also unclear how Baseball Chapel leaders would react to an openly gay player. We would be thrilled to work with Baseball Chapel on a way to tailor our message to make sure its something Christian leaders in the baseball community are comfortable with, but that also gets the message across that we need to change the homophobic culture, eliminate slurs and treat gay baseball players with respect, Burke said. I think thats completely in agreement with what Baseball Chapel is preaching and Christianity as a whole is preaching. Asked how she would counsel a player struggling to square his Christian faith with the acceptance of a gay teammate, Armour said she would begin by talking about the specific Bible passages that concerned him before going into a broader discussion of the Christian message. When Jesus was asked about the essence of faith, he said to love God and love your neighbor as yourself, she said. We have to ask, What did Jesus exhibit? What did Jesus do in his own ministry? It seems pretty clear that Jesus ministry was anything but exclusionary. For athletes unconvinced by the Christian argument, Burke raises the predominant concern in sports: winning. He believes gay players perform better after coming out, because they no longer need to devote energy toward, as he calls it, creating a false life. A Palm Center study on the repeal of the U.S. militarys Dont ask, dont tell policy confirmed as much, saying the change had no overall negative impact on readiness or cohesion, adding, Greater openness and honesty seem to have promoted increased understanding, respect and acceptance. VOICING SUPPORT NBA star Steve Nash supports gay marriage. Watch the video. In other words: The militarys locker room improved. We all get into sports because we want to win, Burke said. I want to win a Stanley Cup. Whoever can get me there, I want them on my team. If a player came out on the Flyers tomorrow, and we had to cut him or trade him to get better, hes gone without hesitation. Id drive him to the airport if hes not the best guy for the job. But if I can win the Cup with 22 gay guys, Ill have the gayest hockey team in the history of the world. Weve got a thousand stats OBP, WAR, WHIP, all that (stuff) to measure what a player brings to the team. Why are we using sexual orientation? Why would anyone care if hes gay or straight? If a hitter gets on base at a .400 clip, or if a pitcher gets guys out, I mean, what else matters?",Raw Data
898,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. Count former Tennessee Titans president Jeff Diamond among those who feel it is a good thing for Gregg Williams to return to the teams coaching staff. Indefinitely suspended last year by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for his role in the New Orleans Saints Bountygate case while defensive coordinator from 2009-11, Williams now can return to coaching in the league only after a team expresses interest and the league reinstates him. Multiple reports citing unnamed sources say Williams and Titans head coach Mike Munchak have discussed and finalized his return to the Titans coaching staff, where Williams worked from 1990-2000, including the last four seasons as defensive coordinator before becoming head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 2001. A Titans official said Sunday that Munchak was not available for comment. The two-year Titans coach has not spoken to local media since the end of Tennessee's disappointing 6-10 season. I think hiring Gregg can be a positive, said Diamond, the former NFL Executive of the Year and Titans president from 1999-2004, the first season of which the Titans went to the Super Bowl. He worked two seasons with Williams. First off, Gregg has learned his lesson, Diamond added, so there will be no more issues there. He has paid his penalty. Williams was suspended for the 2012 season after the NFL determined he was the leader of a bounty system among players for their deeds on the field. The bounty total was determined to have been as much as $50,000 at times. The NFL recently reinstated Saints head coach Sean Payton after he served a one-season suspension. Heading into the 2012 season, Williams had been hired as defensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams under head coach Jeff Fisher, his former boss with the Houston Oilers and Titans. Williams hiring by the Rams came before the NFL announced its investigation into Bountygate. Fisher has since replaced Williams with former Dallas Cowboys coordinator Rob Ryan. Williams parlayed the success of the Titans defense under his tutelage into becoming known as one of the leagues best defensive minds. After three seasons as head coach of the Bills, he was defensive coordinator with Washington and Jacksonville before moving to New Orleans. Gregg is a very good and successful football coach, Diamond said. He can add knowledge and experience to that coaching staff. It is a smart move. Brad Hopkins a 13-year Pro Bowl offensive lineman with the Oilers and Titans is in agreement with Diamond. Hopkins played alongside Munchak, the Pro Football Hall of Famer, as a teammate before being coached by him as position coach. I think that it is fabulous, Hopkins said. If you are worried about him getting the franchise in trouble, thats silly. The guy is coming off an investigation that will make sure he will never do anything like that again. From there, whats left? Its Gregg Williams, the coach, and thats all the things that made him a great coach. He motivates players and understands and coaches his schemes. His body of work is so extensive. Currently, there are no openings on the Titans defensive coaching staff. Jerry Gray remains defensive coordinator after his unit gave up the most points in franchise history last season. When Williams became head coach of the Bills, he named Gray his defensive coordinator. Gregg will be able work great with Jerry, Diamond said. They have a lot of time coaching together. There was one defensive coaching staff change. The team fired linebackers coach Frank Bush and replaced him with Chet Parlavecchio, who was promoted from special teams assistant. While commenting two weeks ago through a team release on all the coaching staff changes, including firing offensive coordinator Chris Palmer and promoting Dowell Loggains from quarterbacks coach, Munchak hinted there might be more coaching changes to come. We still have some spots remaining to fill, said Munchak, who worked alongside Williams on former head coach Jeff Fishers staff as offensive line coach. And I am always looking to improve our staff. So, it is still a work in progress. Diamond figures the professional and personal relationship between Munchak, Gray and Williams in the Fisher coaching tree was key in any decision to hire Williams. Everybody is trying to turn the page, especially Gregg, Diamond said.",Raw Data
899,"GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Two losses, 82 points allowed. Those are the results of the Packers' past two visits to the divisional round of the playoffs. If there is one key reason Green Bay has not been able to make it back to the Super Bowl since winning it all on Feb. 6, 2011, it's been the Packers' lackluster postseason defense. It made some sense when Green Bay gave up 37 points to the New York Giants in last year's playoffs. After all, that was a defense that, despite a 15-1 record, struggled all season to get stops. Those Packers allowed more passing yards than any team in NFL history and finished 27th in sacks. The only redeeming factor was their league-leading 31 interceptions, but when the turnovers weren't coming, players couldn't sell the bend-but-don't-break' philosophy with much conviction. This season was supposed to be different. For the most part, until Saturday night against the San Francisco 49ers, it was. General manager Ted Thompson drafted defensive players with the team's first six picks, a clear admission by Green Bay's front office -- though it wasn't publicly admitted -- that the Packers needed a lot of help on that side of the ball. But, once again, when the season was on the line, Green Bay's defense failed to show up. The 49ers scored 45 points and sent the Packers into offseason mode, leaving plenty of questions about what Thompson can do to try to fix it this time. Between scheme, personnel and execution, something has been missing. Blame will inevitably fall on defensive coordinator Dom Capers, the 62-year-old who has been orchestrating his 3-4 scheme in Green Bay since 2009. Nearly every call Capers dialed up en route to winning the Super Bowl worked, but the postseason hasn't been kind to him since. Saturday night against the 49ers, aside from the opening drive, Capers had no answer for dual-threat quarterback Colin Kaepernick. San Francisco's offense was always a step or two ahead of Capers' play-calling as Kaepernick ran and passed at will, leading the 49ers to 579 total yards. Consecutive divisional-round defeats to the tune of 82 combined points don't happen without significant failures on multiple defensive fronts. Though Capers had his shortcomings, so did the players who were expected to execute at a much higher level than what was displayed on the field. Linebacker Clay Matthews had a sack on Kaepernick while putting pressure on 49ers All-Pro left tackle Joe Staley and proved, as he does in most games, to be a difference-maker. Cornerback Sam Shields had the best defensive play of the game for the Packers when he intercepted Kaepernick and returned it for a touchdown. So, it's not as if there aren't any positives from Saturday's game. But, overall, it was yet another defensive debacle that cost Green Bay a chance to build a dynasty. A Packers dynasty seemed possible as confetti fell onto the field two years ago with then-27-year-old emerging star quarterback Aaron Rodgers grabbing hold of the Lombardi Trophy. Green Bay's offense got even better the season following the Super Bowl victory, leading the NFL in scoring. Rodgers, along with a deep group of wide receivers, were in control of the league. To beat the Packers meant having to outscore them, and that appeared to be quite a challenging feat. But Green Bay's defense has not given the necessary support to its offense to create the juggernaut the team was capable of becoming. A dynasty can't exist with this type of imbalance. The Packers had the ball for only 21 minutes and 59 seconds in the loss to San Francisco. In that time, they scored 24 points -- which does not include, of course, Shields' defensive touchdown. It was far from Rodgers' best game, but that's a very solid point total within that time of possession. Regardless of how the offense performed, though, Green Bay had almost no chance to win when allowing 45 points. Rodgers can't be counted on to match that. He is the NFL's reigning Most Valuable Player, but there's nothing he can do if the Packers' defense is so porous. Meanwhile, two years of his prime have passed by without a return to the NFL's biggest stage. The past two postseasons have exposed Green Bay as a team: Good enough to make it to the divisional round of the playoffs, not good enough to avoid a resounding defeat in the divisional round of the playoffs. That won't change until the Packers' defense changes. Whether it's a change in coordinator, a rare leap into free agency or assembling the best draft class in the history of the NFL, nothing is going to make Green Bay a true Super Bowl contender again until its defense sees drastic improvement.",Raw Data
900,"The list of players who arent competing for Team USA at the World Baseball Classic is probably more star-studded than the roster of those who are. INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR See which countries are represented by MLB's foreign-born players. Among the no-shows: Buster Posey, Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Andrew McCutchen, Prince Fielder, Josh Hamilton, Justin Verlander, Clayton Kershaw, Matt Cain, David Price, Gio Gonzalez, Stephen Strasburg, Cole Hamels, Jered Weaver and Jim Johnson. As I wrote this week, thats not acceptable if Team USA and the WBC itself are to reach their full potential. And yet, Team USA is plenty talented enough to win its first WBC title in the tournaments third installment. Manager Joe Torre didnt pick an All-Star team. He did, however, choose the sort of role players who are important in international play. Thats particularly true in the bullpen, considering starting pitchers are limited to 65 pitchers per game in the first round, 80 in the second, and 95 in the semifinals and finals. WORLD BASEBALL CLASSIC Venezuelan stars honored to play WBC grows sport globally | Pics Stars unable to represent Cuba Time for Team USA to win tourney Players, owners benefit financially So, America, learn these names if you dont know them already: J.P. Arencibia, Ben Zobrist, Willie Bloomquist, Tim Collins, Glen Perkins, Mitchell Boggs, Steve Cishek, Luke Gregerson, and Vinnie Pestano. All of them appeared the 27-player provisional roster announced Thursday morning. Torre and his staff (which includes pitching coach Greg Maddux) have until Feb. 20 to submit their final 28-man roster. That leaves plenty of time for one of the absent stars to change his mind and join the team. For now, Torre and Maddux have settled on 10 relief pitchers for a 14-man pitching staff, along with a rotation of R.A. Dickey, Ryan Vogelsong, Kris Medlen and Derek Holland. Would a quartet of Verlander, Kershaw, Price and Strasburg have been sexier? Sure. But its hard to argue too much with the selections of Dickey (reigning National League Cy Young Award winner), Vogelsong (3-0 record and 1.09 ERA last postseason) and Medlen (best pitcher in baseball during 2012 second half). Holland, meanwhile, is coming off a disappointing season with Texas: 12-7 with a 4.67 ERA. But Team USA will need him to start, unless Verlander or Kershaw decides to join as the 28th man. As it stands now, Team USA will play four games in five days if they advance out of pool play (March 8, 9, 10, 12). SPRING FEVER Miss baseball already? There's plenty going on. Mark your calendar with these important offseason dates. That means four starting pitchers, as long as Torre wants to keep his rotation on regular rest which he undoubtedly does, given the perpetual (if unsubstantiated) fears of pitching injuries in the WBC. Torre wisely picked three left-handed relievers, all of whom are capable of throwing more than one inning if needed: Jeremy Affeldt (postseason-tested with the Giants), Perkins (former starter in Minnesota) and Collins (21 appearances of more than three outs with the Royals last year). And Team USA has two All-Star closers from last season, Atlantas Craig Kimbrel and Clevelands Chris Perez. In the end, its difficult to say any nation in the 16-team tournament will have a better pitching staff than Team USA. No team the US will face in Phoenix-based pool play Canada, Italy, or Mexico has what one would consider a major-league-caliber ace. As for the later rounds, Venezuela has ace Felix Hernandez but lacks depth behind him. Yu Darvish has elected not to pitch for Japan, the two-time defending champion. The US infield appears set, with first baseman Mark Teixeira, second baseman Brandon Phillips, shortstop Jimmy Rollins and third baseman David Wright. Torre will carry three catchers Joe Mauer, Arencibia and Jonathan Lucroy because they probably wont be ready to squat for nine innings on back-to-back days that early in the season. FOREIGN EXCHANGE Some of the greatest athletes to play in America were born elsewhere. Outfielders Ryan Braun, Adam Jones and Giancarlo Stanton should be fixtures in the everyday lineup, with Shane Victorino as the reserve. Braun and Stanton likely will rotate through the designated hitter spot, opening up outfield at-bats for Victorino or Zobrist, the super-utility dynamo. This may be the most athletic Team USA to date, with three players who stole 30 or more bases last year (Victorino, Rollins and Braun) and four others with at least 14 (Jones, Phillips, Wright and Zobrist). That could make the difference in a tournament that has suited teams known for their ability to execute fundamentals; Japan, South Korea and Cuba are the only nations who can say they have reached the final game. Maybe Team USA will be able to change that March 19 at San Franciscos AT&T Park without contributions from some of the countrys biggest stars.",Raw Data

902,"Oscar Pistorius wept Tuesday as his defense lawyer read the athlete's account of how he shot his girlfriend to death on Valentine's Day, claiming he had mistaken her for an intruder. Prosecutors, however, told a packed courtroom that the double-amputee known as the Blade Runner intentionally and mercilessly shot and killed 29-year-old model Reeva Steenkamp as she cowered inside a locked bathroom. Pistorius told the Pretoria Magistrate's Court at a bail hearing he felt vulnerable in the presence of an intruder inside the bathroom because he did not have his prosthetic legs on, and fired into the bathroom door. In a major point of contention that has already emerged, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said Pistorius took the time to put on his prostheses, walked seven meters (yards) from the bed to the enclosed toilet inside his bathroom and only then opened fire. Three of the bullets hit Steenkamp of the four that were fired into the door, Nel said. Pistorius said in his sworn statement that after opening fire, he realized that Steenkamp was not in his bed. ''It filled me with horror and fear,'' Pistorius said. The 26-year-old Olympian said he put on his prosthetic legs and tried to kick down the door before finally giving up and bashing it in with a cricket bat. Inside, he said he found Steenkamp, slumped over. He said he lifted her bloodied body into his arms and tried to carry her downstairs to seek medical help. But by then, it was too late. ''She died in my arms,'' the athlete said. The Valentine's Day shooting death hocked South Africans and many around the world who idolized Pistorius for overcoming adversity to become a sports champion, competing in the London Olympics last year in track besides being a Paralympian. Steenkamp was a model and law graduate who made her debut on a South African reality TV program that was broadcast on Saturday, two days after her death. Nel charged Pistorius with premeditated murder and said the athlete opened fire after they engaged in a shouting match. ''She couldn't go anywhere. You can run nowhere,'' Nel said. ''It must have been horrific.'' Chief Magistrate Desmond Nair ruled that Pistorius must face the harshest bail requirements available in South African law. That means Pistorius' lawyers must offer ''exceptional'' reasons for the athlete to be free before trial, besides simply giving up his two South African passports and posting a cash bond. Pistorius sobbed softly as his lawyer, Barry Roux, insisted the shooting was an accident and that there was no evidence to substantiate a murder charge. ''Was it to kill her, or was it to get her out?'' he asked about the broken-down door. ''We submit it is not even murder. There is no concession this is a murder.'' Pistorius' emotional outbursts again played a part in how the hearing progessed, as it did during an initial hearing Friday. At one point, Nair stopped the hearing after Pistorius wept as Roux read a portion of the athlete's statement describing how Steenkamp bought him a Valentine's Day present, but wouldn't let him open it the night before. ''Maintain your composure,'' the magistrate said. ''You need to apply your mind here.'' Pistorius' voice quivered when he answered: ''Yes, my lordship.'' Affidavits from friends of Pistorius and Steenkamp read out by Roux in the hearing described the two as a charming, happy couple. The night before the killing, they said, Pistorius and Steenkamp had canceled separate plans in order to spend the night before Valentine's Day together at his home, in a gated neighborhood of Pretoria. Outside the court, several dozen singing women protested against domestic violence and waved placards urging that Pistorius be refused bail. ''Pistorius must rot in jail,'' one placard said. As details emerged at the dramatic court hearing in the capital, Steenkamp's body was being cremated Tuesday at a memorial service in the south-coast port city of Port Elizabeth. The family said members had arrived from around the world. Six pallbearers carried her coffin, draped with a white cloth and covered in white flowers, into the church for the private service. South Africa has some of the world's worst rates of violence against females and the highest rate in the world of women killed by an intimate partner, according to a study by the Medical Research Council. Another council study estimates a child or woman is raped every four minutes. While homicide rates have dropped, the number of women killed by current or former partners has increased, said the council's Professor Rachel Jewkes. At least three women are killed by a partner every day in the country of 50 million, she said. Steenkamp campaigned actively against domestic violence and had tweeted on Twitter that she planned to join a ''Black Friday'' protest by wearing black in honor of a 17-year-old girl who was gang-raped and mutilated two weeks ago. What ''she stood for, and the abuse against women, unfortunately it's gone right around and I think the Lord knows that statement is more powerful now,'' her uncle Mike Steenkamp, the family's spokesman, said after her memorial. He said the family had planned a big get-together at Christmas but that had not been possible. ''But we are here today as a family and the only one who's missing is Reeva,'' he said, breaking down and weeping. Pistorius has lost several valuable sponsorships estimated to be worth more than $1 million a year. On Tuesday, the athlete was ousted from a pro-gay campaign being launched in Cape Town, organizers said. In a video axed from the campaign, Pistorius says: ''You don't have to worry. You don't have to change. Take a deep breath and remember, `It will get better.''' And Clarins Group, which owns Thierry Mugler Perfumes, said in an email that ''out of respect and compassion for the families involved in this tragedy, Thierry Mugler Perfumes have taken the decision to withdraw all of their advertising campaigns featuring Oscar Pistorius.''",Raw Data
903,"Chiefs owner Clark Hunt was at his side, offering support. Members of the team hugged each other, the mud smearing with tears on their cheeks. And over along the wall stood the empty locker that once belonged to Jovan Belcher, his jersey still hanging from a hook. Just one day after the linebacker killed his girlfriend and then turned the gun on himself, the Chiefs banded together to play their finest game of the season, an inspired 27-21 victory over the Carolina Panthers that ended an eight-game losing streak suddenly rendered trivial. ''As far as playing the game, I thought that was the best for us to do, because that's what we do,'' Crennel said, tears forming in the corners of his eyes. ''We're football players and football coaches and that's what we do, we play on Sunday.'' According to authorities, Belcher shot his girlfriend multiple times early Saturday at a residence near Arrowhead Stadium, then sped to the team's practice facility and turn the gun on himself as Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli watched in the parking lot. Pioli walked through the press box before the game and said he was doing ''OK.'' ''It's been an incredibly difficult 24 hours for our family and our entire organization,'' Hunt said. ''We have so many guys on our team and our coaching staff who are really, really hurting.'' Chiefs players gathered in the tunnel leading to the field for a brief prayer before their pregame stretching. A few fans in the half-empty stadium held up signs referencing the shootings, and there was a moment of silence to remember all victims of domestic violence. Kansas City police have not released a motive for the shootings, which claimed the life of Belcher and 22-year-old Kasandra M. Perkins, and left a 3-month-old girl, Zoey, an orphan. ''I'm just trying to get through the rest of today,'' said the Chiefs' Brady Quinn, who threw his first two touchdown passes in three years. ''The emotions of what has taken place will probably hit home for a few guys the next few days, when they realize what's taken place.'' Cam Newton threw for 232 yards and three touchdowns for the Panthers (3-9), who were informed the game would be played as scheduled while they were heading to Kansas City on Saturday. DeAngelo Williams added 67 yards rushing, carrying the load with Jonathan Stewart out with an injury. Steve Smith, Greg Olsen and Louis Murphy caught Carolina's TD passes. ''You definitely feel for them. What they are going through is tragic,'' Olsen said. ''But we have a job to do. Our job is to come here and prepare to win. They wouldn't expect any less.'' Peyton Hillis had a touchdown run for Kansas City (2-10), while Tony Moeaki and Jon Baldwin had touchdown catches. Ryan Succop hit a pair of field goals, including a 52-yarder with 4:54 left that forced the Panthers try for a touchdown to steal the win. Instead, they went three-and-out, and the Chiefs were able to run the clock down to 31 seconds before giving back the ball. Newton completed two quick passes to reach the Carolina 38, but his final heave as time expired was caught by Smith short of the end zone. ''They played an inspired football game,'' Rivera said. ''They did some really good things, and we have to give them credit, because they suffered through a very difficult time.'' The emotions were raw even after the kickoff. Kansas City took the opening possession and marched 74 yards in just six plays, including a 21-yard pass to Dwayne Bowe and a 34-yarder to Baldwin that got the Chiefs to the Carolina 2. Hillis powered in to score the first touchdown for Kansas City on the opening possession of a game since Dec. 26, 2010. It was also the first touchdown drive engineered by Quinn since December 2009, when he helped the Browns beat the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Hillis ran to the sideline after scoring his first touchdown of the season and handed the ball to Crennel, then gave the guy who managed to hold the team together a hug. The Panthers answered with a long touchdown drive of their own. The big play came when safety Abe Elam watched Olsen haul in a 47-yard pass from Newton for the tying touchdown. The Chiefs had tacked on a field goal when the Panthers struck again, this time after Newton completed three passes to convert third downs, the last finding Smith in the end zone. But Kansas City finished off the half with one of its best drives of the year, an 80-yard march that took up the final 7:25. Hillis was stuffed at the line on third-and-goal, and Crennel allowed the clock to hit 2 seconds before calling timeout. On the final play of the half, Quinn saw Moeaki open in the back of the end zone and delivered a soft toss for a 17-14 lead. Breathing room came late in the third quarter when the Chiefs used 17 plays to go 87 yards on a drive that lasted another 10 minutes. Quinn finished it with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Baldwin. Carolina mounted a comeback with the opening drive of the fourth quarter, with Newton hitting Murphy on a quick slant route from the 8 to get the Panthers within a field goal. But the Chiefs added their own field goal, and then burned enough of the clock to ensure the victory. One that allowed the Chiefs to celebrate in the midst of their mourning. ''There were pockets in the game where reality hits you again, and that's sobering,'' said Chiefs linebacker Andy Studebaker. ''I've been telling people, Jovan was like a brother to us. His family was family to us. Our hearts go out to them, man, and the game maybe took our heads off it for a while - it brought us closer as a team today, I think - but it's never going to be easy.''

Basketball was just like a marriage: love, time consuming, commitment, sacrifice, hard work, laughs, tears ... a ring was even involved (a WNBA championship in 2005). But after a lifelong commitment to Spalding, it was time to part ways. And even though I'm somewhat sad about my separation, I'm truly like a wild, single woman ready to enjoy my freedom! :) Immediately following the WNBA season, I flew home to Portugal to attend my brother's wedding -- a beautiful ceremony on a bright, sunny day. It meant the world to me to be able to be present on this special day. [+] Enlarge Courtesy of Ticha PenicheiroTicha Penicheiro kicked off retirement with some fun and sun in one of her favorite places, Miami. After three weeks of catching up with my family and friends, eating my mom's food and babysitting my nephew while the newlyweds were enjoying their honeymoon in the Maldives, I flew back to the States. First, I made a quick pit stop in Sacramento and then I took my talents to South Beach to kick off my retirement plan. Growing up on the coast of Portugal (Figueira da Foz) I have always been a beach bum, in love with sun rays, waves and sand, so Miami is one of my favorite places in the whole world. I just love the mix of cultures and ethnicities -- the warm weather and clear blue waters. I must admit I was kind of worried after a few weeks away from basketball that I was going to have to deal with a thing called boredom. But I was able to find enough activities to keep me busy, and I can actually confess doing NOTHING was, almost, at the top of the list. I actually enjoyed not setting an alarm to wake up, not having an agenda and just being a free spirit and taking in the day, as the day came. In between my couch potato ways, I tried to stay active and find fun activities to stay in shape: yoga, walking, biking, swimming, surfing, beach volleyball and tanning! I guess I take this opportunity to thank my volleyball instructors: Ruth Riley, Jenny Boucek and Kelly Schumacher. I truly enjoyed the experience and will be ready to take over the courts upon my return. Just because I retired, doesn't mean I've lost my love for the game of basketball. Being in Miami gave me an opportunity to watch my favorite NBA team: the Miami Heat. And boy, oh boy -- LeBron James, wow! To be in the building and watch him play live just makes you realize how amazing he is: his strength, speed, IQ, court vision and leadership are second to none. I can assure you I have been enjoying my time away from the court, but also have been reassured basketball will ALWAYS be a huge part of my life. I can't go a day without checking the NBA scores, watching ""SportsCenter"" or even finding links to watch my WNBA homies playing overseas. I have also taken the time to give it some thought and soon I will share what is in store for the next chapter in my life. Right now I'm sitting on a plane heading to Turkey. I played for Galatasaray last year and really fell in love with Istanbul. I will be able to connect with former teammates, old and new friends and, of course, watch a little basketball. (I told you I can't stay away for long). Then, it's time to head back to Portugal to spend the holidays with my family. Another perk of being retired is the fact I have more time to enjoy my family and my country. There's no better time to be with your loved ones than Christmas. I will definitely be wearing that red sweat suit and long, white beard to play Santa because my nephew is expecting Santa to make an appearance and drop off some toys! I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a 2013 full of joy and happiness. If you want to keep up with my retirement adventures, you can always follow me on twitter @tichapenicheiro. I appreciate your support throughout the years and I encourage you to continue to support the WNBA. The future is bright and the 2013 season should be an AMAZING one! Ticha Penicheiro",Raw Data
905,"Brendan Rodgers reflects on Liverpool's dramatic game with Zenit Brendan Rodgers hailed as ""phenomenal"" a Liverpool performance that almost delivered a stunning comeback against Zenit St Petersburg but fell short of rescuing Anfield's last hope of silverware this season. Liverpool required four unanswered goals to reach the last 16 of the Europa League at the expense of the Russian champions after Hulk capitalised on a Jamie Carragher mistake to put Zenit 3-0 ahead on aggregate in the first half. Luis Suárez led the fightback with two excellent free-kicks and Joe Allen scored his first goal for Liverpool but the fourth agonisingly eluded Rodgers' team on a rousing Anfield night. The Liverpool manager said: ""I am very proud of the club and the players even though we lost the tie. The club and players showed why we are part of the world's greatest football family. The atmosphere and what they put in to come back from a three-goal deficit and put in that effort was a phenomenal show. ""I thought we should have had a penalty too. The crowd and players couldn't do more. It was a fantastic night but we probably lost the tie over in Russia. To have to score that many goals and nearly do it gives me so much pride."" Suárez had several penalty appeals dismissed by the Dutch referee, Bjorn Kuipers, but Rodgers was particularly aggrieved at an apparent 50th-minute handball from Tomas Hubocan. ""It certainly was a penalty,"" he said. ""We had momentum throughout the game and it looked a clear one. I don't think there was any debate about it, especially with the fourth or fifth official or whatever they call them standing behind the goal and looking straight at it. We wanted to make every effort to go through and the players couldn't have done any more. We will look back on the game over there as one where poor goals ultimately cost us victory."" Carragher's error came in his 150th and last European appearance for Liverpool with the defender retiring in the summer. But his manager said: ""There is no blame on Carra. That is the first mistake I think I have seen him make since I arrived at the club and that includes training. I thought he was brilliant tonight in how he controlled Hulk. It was just one of those unfortunate things but I am disappointed for him because he's a brilliant professional and he deserved to go through."" Rodgers was adamant Liverpool's European exit would not signal the end of a season in which they are out of the FA Cup and nine points behind fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League qualification. ""Our season was never going to finish until the final whistle against QPR,"" he said. ""This group is growing all the time and the performance to dominate a team of this ilk was incredible. We just have to continue going forward as we have from the turn of the year. You can see the players' hunger and determination to do that.""",Raw Data
906,"Star Plaza has only five greats, compared to the Hollywood Walk of Fame's 2,431 movie stars ... and theater owners, costume designers, makeup artists and cartoon characters Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Shrek and the Simpsons. ""I really don't know what to make of it,"" said West, pleased and embarrassed, as usual. ""I really, honestly did not play basketball to have a statue. I loved to compete. Days of games were probably the most special times in my life.... ""I did the same thing every day because of the excitement of having the opportunity and what it felt like sitting in the locker room, antsy, nervous.... ""It was really, really different. We were so close as teammates. ""It's unbelievably flattering that somebody would want to do this, unbelievably — but candidly, I wish Elgin Baylor would be right there beside me."" If West is special to young people, it's because of the glow he never lost ... and because in 1969, some bumpkin in the low-wattage NBA office took an old action picture, reversed it so West was driving left into the middle of the design and used the silhouette for a new logo. Had anyone given any thought to who it was, using a white player to represent an ever-more African American league would have set off a furor. The NBA now insists it doesn't know who the player is. West was more than a trademark silhouette or a hero for white fans with his heart-on-his-sleeve game and personality in addition to his feats that made him as beloved by peers as fans. The NBA no longer has nights like the one for West at the Forum in 1972, when retired, unapproachable Bill Russell flew in and announced: ""If I had could have one wish granted, it would be that you would always be happy."" And now, Mr. Clutch in winter, at 72, at peace, in bronze, on the sidewalk. If West remains close to owner Jerry Buss and protege-as-GM Mitch Kupchak, he has no formal connection to the team. Forget sentiment, this is Jerry West, whose whirling mind remains one of the NBA's keenest. Seeing things in degrees of horror, West could never win enough, never thought he was home free ... and wasn't even invited back as $1-a-year consultant after retiring as Memphis GM in 2007. West would never ask, they knew he didn't need a job or money ... and Jerry and Jim Buss liked it the way it was. Thus the Feb. 17 unveiling follows the unveiling of West's unsparing views on the Lakers' age, inability to defend and day of reckoning. Players didn't like it and fans were dismayed but Magic Johnson added his voice (""We're looking old and playing old."") Meanwhile, Coach Phil Jackson now plays three guards at the end with Steve Blake in and Ron Artest out. Unfortunately for the Lakers, the new reality just dawned on them: Their days of being so good they could mop up the West and win a title at 75% of their potential are over. Minimally athletic before, they're less so since Trevor Ariza's agent, David Lee, messed up a slam-dunk deal in 2009. Stunned at hearing they had to pay more — because Ariza was from here — the Lakers jumped on Artest as if it was a coup. Actually, it was like dropping a cannon ball on a puzzle with one piece missing. They almost lost Lamar Odom that summer when Jerry Buss withdrew his three-year $27-million offer — $54 million, including luxury tax — before yielding to pleas to bring him back. More failure to understand where they were has continued this season. With the Lakers 13-2 and Theo Ratliff out, Jackson couldn't get the Jake Voskuhl-level backup he wanted at a cost of $70,000 a week in salary and tax. With courtside seats at $2,600, the Lakers make $70K every game from 27 of their total of 136. Pau Gasol wilted playing heavy minutes and has yet to un-wilt as they went 21-14. On Dec. 15, they gave New Jersey a No. 1 pick to take Sasha Vujacic's $5.4-million salary, which looked good until Lakers' fortunes and energy levels sank. If Sasha looks better in retrospect, that pick, which could have brought a young athlete, looks better still. But that was then and this is now, after a week of running around in circles, debating Artest's desire to stay. Actually, with Artest, at 32, having two seasons left worth $14 million, West may not go out as a Laker, but Ronnie will. If someone like Washington's Kirk Hinrich is possible, salvation must come from within. Bryant — who singed teammates after the Miami rout (""I'm going to kick some ... in practice"") and invited a press rip after the Memphis rout (""It builds great tension for us and you sell a lot of papers"") — issued a different invitation to critics. Of course, the line to accommodate Bryant would include West, Johnson and, of course, Kobe. Bryant, the angriest, most invested critic, is now sticking up for his teammates, the right thing to do, no matter how many faces he has. If he's scorching them privately, he'd better get it under control, because it'll be a long, hard slog to April. Even if he's supportive, no one does it like Bryant, as when ESPN's Colleen Dominguez asked the mandatory lost-to-all-the-good-teams question. ""You heard what I said,"" said Bryant, staring the other way. ""My feelings haven't changed."" Actually, for someone concerned with his legacy, withdrawing from public life might be better than presenting yourself as a bigger and bigger jerk. Ask West, who brought Bryant here: Everything is really, really different.",Raw Data
907,"Watson, the last man to marshal a victorious US team on foreign soil — at The Belfry in 1993 — was unveiled by the PGA of America on Thursday as his nation’s oldest Ryder Cup captain. Much will be said and written about the controversial appointment, which certainly reflects the “outside the box” thinking of incoming PGA of America president Ted Bishop. Going with a man who will be 65 in two years — eight years older than Sam Snead was in 1969 — represents a roll of the dice. But I don’t think Bishop has rolled snake eyes on this choice. The PGA’s strategy of choosing a “buddy captain” — a major winner in his 40s who’s still a contemporary of the players on the team — has failed. As illustrated most recently by Davis Love III in Chicago, American leadership has devolved into captain-by-committee. Keeping players loose with pingpong tournaments and letting them have a say in pairings works at the Presidents Cup — see: Freddie Couples — but not so well on the far more intense battlefield of the Ryder Cup. And while proponents will point to the success of Paul Azinger in 2008, it must be noted that he benefited from three crucial factors at Valhalla. The first was that he has a strong personality and did it his way. The second was a raucous home crowd. The third — and perhaps most crucial — was that Azinger got to face off against Nick Faldo. Aloof and socially awkward — his opening ceremony speech ranks as the worst ever — Faldo alienated his players, polluting Europe’s elan vital in Ryder Cups: camaraderie. Bishop, an old-school, grass-roots golf pro from Indiana, had come to a similar conclusion about American captains, at one point hinting that he was looking at a “Jack Nicklaus-type” leader. ""We've had a lot of captains in their 40s who are close to the players,"" he said in an interview last month. I think we've got to do something different than we've done in the past. I think we've got to look at who can motivate our team and put them in position to win over there."" There will be those who will say that Watson is too old and out of touch, but such thinking conveniently forgets he almost won the 2009 British Open at Turnberry and played one of the best rounds I’ve ever seen a year later in horrendous conditions at Royal St George’s. If any American player — and that includes Tiger Woods, who isn’t a fan of Watson — can’t respect an eight-time major champion who still has that kind of game into his 60s, then the problem is not Watson’s. What Watson will bring, undoubtedly, is leadership. ""I don't think he asked anybody, to tell you the truth,"" John Cook told Golf Digest about Watson’s leadership style in 1993. ""He had his game plan with (childhood teacher) Stan Thirsk. He talked to Roy Williams, who was then at Kansas, about coaching. “I know he had his practice pairings, but he just kind of observed, made his mental notes and made the pairings. “We had such a complete trust in Tom and what he was doing. He was the captain. He ran the show. He took the bull and rode it all the way to the end."" And in that sense, he’ll be a radical departure from a long line of fortysomething American captains who have been preoccupied with making sure their players – and their wives and caddies — enjoy the Ryder Cup experience. “He doesn’t go out there to have fun,” said Lanny Wadkins, who was also on the victorious ‘93 team. He goes out there to kick butt and get the job done.” The other reason that Watson is an inspired choice is that he’s beloved in Scotland, which might at least soften the anti-American galleries. No American has loved the old links like “Wee Tom,” who won four of his five claret jugs on Scottish soil. It seems every golf club in Scotland has a photograph of the day Watson came to play. ""There is a great Scottish word the Scots sometimes like to use to describe themselves and that word is 'thrawn,' Scottish author and golf writer Lawrence Donegan, told me in October. “It means tight-lipped, determined and serious. If you are talking about the love affair Scots have with Tom Watson — and, believe me, he is revered over there — I think it comes down to this. They see him as one of their own. He's Scot in all but his nationality."" “We Scots love the way Watson swings the club, the brisk pace of his game and, most of all, the sportsmanship with which he has always played,” he said. “To us, he embodies all that is good about golf, especially in the way — like (Bobby) Jones and (Jack) Nicklaus before him — he has reacted to adversity. “Perversely perhaps, how a golfer loses rather than how he wins has always been our ultimate measure of a man.” None of this is to say it will be easy for Watson. The expectations will be high, and he’ll immediately be faced with questions about Woods, a fellow Stanford man with whom he has feuded for some time. After Woods was embroiled in a tabloid scandal, Watson wrote to him, telling Woods what he’d been longing to say for years — that he needed to “clean up his act.” ""I feel that he has not carried the same stature as the other great players that have come along like Jack [Nicklaus], Byron Nelson, [Ben] Hogan in the sense that there was bad language and club throwing on the golf course,"" he said. ""You can grant that to somebody, a young person, that has not been out there for a while, but I think he needs to clean up his act and show the respect for the game that the people before him have shown."" Woods doesn’t take such criticism well. On Wednesday morning, I asked Woods’ representatives if he had a reaction to Watson’s appointment. It came on Thursday morning, and it sounded hopeful. “I'd like to congratulate Tom Watson on his selection as Ryder Cup captain. I think he's a really good choice,"" Woods said in a statement. ""Tom knows what it takes to win, and that's our ultimate goal. I hope I have the privilege of joining him on the 2014 United States team.”",Raw Data

909,"﻿This is probably not the best time to make guarantees, but Kobe Bryant has made one. The Lakers, he said, will make the playoffs. Granted, they’re three games under .500 and 3½ games out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference, but Bryant sounded certain when he told SI.com that it was going to happen. “It's not a question of if we make the playoffs,” Bryant told the website. “We will. And when we get there, I have no fear of anyone -- Oklahoma City, San Antonio, Denver ... whoever. I have zero nervousness about that.” Steve Nash, although not as vocal, backed Bryant on the issue. “That’s great,” Nash said. “You love it when your best player has that confidence and that challenge. He’s put it out there for us to go get it now.” Added coach Mike D'Antoni: “I’m not a guarantee kind of guy but I’ll let [Bryant] do the talking since he’s got to do the walking. ""He’s got a lot to say about it, so that’s good. I don’t mind, as long as we back it up. I think it’s great. You have to have that mind-set and I think everybody does.” Bryant’s confidence has never been shaky, and it was easy to understand his belief that the Lakers (26-29) can make a late run and reach the postseason. They beat the Boston Celtics on Wednesday in an emotional game honoring their owner, Jerry Buss, who died this week, and they’ve won nine of their past 13 games. But they still have 27 left to play, including contests against the Nuggets and the Thunder in the next two weeks. So time is running out. Bryant, however, isn’t about to consider anything less than the playoffs. And it’s not just his own confidence that he’s talking about. “… I'm not talking about just me,” he said. “Us as a group. We will make the playoffs. And we will compete. And part of the reason I have that confidence is the Miami game (a 107-97 loss in Miami on Feb. 10). We had control of the game. That was no fluke. We were playing very, very well. We were reading the defense, making the extra pass. OK, they have two great players (LeBron James and Dwayne Wade) who scored eight straight buckets and took control of the game. But we were right there. We can do it.” Now all his teammates have to do is make Bryant look good. Dwight Howard, who has been the subject of much scrutiny but this week said he saw himself as the cornerstone of the franchise, said he thinks Lakers still have a shot at the postseason. “I’m not going to sit up here and say, ‘No, we’re not going to make it,’ ” Dwight Howard said. “We’ve got to have faith. If we don’t we’re not going to make it. I believe that we’re going to turn this around and we’re going to be great.”",Raw Data
910,"FIFA says it will use goal-line technology at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, and could have four systems competing for selection. FIFA said it is now seeking tenders from companies which want their system to be used at the Confederations Cup in June and next year's World Cup. ''Interested GLT companies will be invited to join an inspection visit to the Confederations Cup venues, currently scheduled for mid-March, with a final decision due to be confirmed in early April,'' FIFA said in a statement. FIFA President Sepp Blatter insisted on giving World Cup referees high-tech aids to rule on disputed goal-line incidents after seeing England midfielder Frank Lampard have a clear goal denied against Germany at the 2010 tournament in South Africa. The English Premier League also said Tuesday that plans are on course to introduce goal-line technology by the start of the new season in August. The decision by FIFA was expected once its rule-making panel, known as IFAB, decided last July to approve goal-line technology at competitive matches after two systems passed extensive tests. The camera-based Hawk-Eye system and GoalRef, which uses magnetic sensors, were used at the Club World Cup in Japan in December. Those two systems were expected to compete for World Cup duty, though two competitors are making late entries in the contest. FIFA said two German systems have completed tests and could soon be approved for use. The companies are not being formally identified until licensing is approved. One system has passed tests devised for FIFA by a Zurich-based technical institute, and results for the second are expected this month, FIFA said. Hawk-Eye is already used in tennis and cricket. The English company was bought by Sony Corp., a World Cup sponsor, during the testing process. GoalRef uses magnetic sensors in the goalposts to track an ''intelligent'' ball, made by Danish company Select. Both systems relay information within one second to the referee's wristwatch. Both passed all pre-game tests in Japan but were not called upon to determine a goal. Before the 2010 World Cup, Blatter had long opposed taking the human element of decision-making from referees. He changed his stance after seeing match officials miss Lampard's shot bounce off the crossbar and land fully over the goal line in Bloemfontein. England would have leveled at 2-2 before halftime but lost 4-1 in the second round. Blatter said two days later that FIFA should reopen the debate, although video replay remains off limits. For the Premier League, discussions are underway with the technology makers before a decision is made on which system to adopt. As well as the systems being bought by the 20 clubs, the Premier League then will have to pay a licensing fee to FIFA to use its approved technology. ''We are progressing in discussions with technology companies,'' Premier League spokesman Dan Johnson told The Associated Press. ''We are still hopeful we will conclude those negotiations and be in a position to put a supplier in all Premier League grounds for the start of next season.'' A final decision will probably have to be made by clubs by June to give them time to test the technology.",Raw Data
911,"KOLO TOURE reckons Manchester City have to win the FA Cup this season to save Roberto Mancini from the sack. The Italian is feeling the heat after seeing the Blues go backwards at home and abroad this season. The champions trail enemies Manchester United by 12 points at the top of the table and crashed out of the Champions League after finishing bottom of their group. And the billionaires are in serious danger of finishing their campaign without a single piece of silverware. Mancinis last hope is winning the FA Cup for a second time in three years, with his side ­facing a home quarter-final against Championship strugglers Barnsley.

When asked if City had to win a trophy to save the Italian boss, Toure said: ""Yes, of course."" It is very important for the players, for us to win, because that will help the manager to be here for sure. But even for us we dont want to finish a season without winning something. Thats hard for City now. Weve delivered before and we need to maintain that by winning trophies. For a team like City its difficult to go a season without winning one trophy. For us the FA Cup is really important and the league as well. Toure admits the players own futures are on the line but insists they will keep fighting until the bitter end. Mancinis men face a crunch ­showdown with Chelsea this weekend knowing Rafa Benitezs side are hot on their heels in third place. He said: ""Thats up to the board, to the manager.

912,"FIFA and local organizers canceled an event celebrating 500 days to go until the 2014 World Cup because of a nightclub fire that killed more than 230 people in southern Brazil on Sunday. FIFA said it maintained confidence in Brazilian authorities' security plans for the World Cup, but the event scheduled for Monday in the capital of Brasilia was called off in respect to the victims of the fire in the southern city of Santa Maria. Organizers said they felt ''extremely sad for what happened'' and expressed ''their sympathy to the families of the victims.'' The unveiling of the official World Cup poster was scheduled for Monday but also was postponed. The poster will be unveiled Wednesday after a meeting of the local organizing committee in Rio de Janeiro. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke, who began a four-day visit to Brazil on Sunday, posted a message on his Twitter account expressing sympathies. ''Very sad to hear of the tragedy in southern Brazil. My condolences to the families of victims,'' wrote Valcke, who is scheduled to visit Fortaleza, Brasilia, Salvador and Rio de Janeiro in the center and north of the country. Santa Maria is about 155 miles from Porto Alegre, among 12 World Cup host cities, in the same state of Rio Grande do Sul. The nightclub fire, which appeared to be the world's deadliest in more than a decade, is likely to again increase scrutiny of safety efforts ahead of the World Cup and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. FIFA reiterated its belief that the local organizing committees and Brazilian city, state and federal agencies are up to the task. ''FIFA has full confidence in the security plans of the LOC and the local authorities,'' soccer's governing body said in a statement. The 2016 Rio organizing committee expressed ''solidarity with the families and friends of the victims of this tragedy,'' adding ''it wishes a quick recovery to those affected.'' Hosting the World Cup and Olympics two years apart has heightened attention on security and crime issues in Brazil, although the discussion has focused possible violence. South Africa's relatively high rates of violent crime were similarly scrutinized before the 2010 World Cup, but that tournament was held without major incident. Because of the tragedy, the Rio Grande do Sul state soccer federation canceled Sunday matches in its first-division regional championship. There was a minute of silence honoring the victims before matches across the country.",Raw Data
913,"Greg Couch has been a national columnist at AOL Fanhouse and The Sporting News and an award-winning columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times. He was featured twice in “Best American Sports Writing” and was recognized this year by the US Tennis Writers Association for best column writing and match coverage. He covers tennis on his personal blog. Technically, choking is only an injury, or medical emergency, if something is stuck in your throat. So the No. 1 women’s tennis player, Victoria Azarenka, on the verge of choking away her match Thursday, resorted to a cheap trick to beat American teen Sloane Stephens in the Australian Open semifinals. Azarenka faked an injury, and walked off the court for 10 minutes for treatment. She says the injury was real. I’m calling B.S. She simply took a 10-minute vacation in air conditioning, leaving Stephens alone on the court in a crucial moment … just ... sitting there ... waiting. The “injury’’ was supposedly for Azarenka’s chest and back, though she didn’t seem to remember that 15 minutes later, when asked after her 6-1, 6-4 victory why she had left the court. “I couldn’t breathe, you know,’’ Azarenka told the on-court reporter. “That game, you know, I just had chest pain, like getting a heart attack or something out there. I just needed to make sure it’s OK cause I really couldn’t breathe.’’ What a terrible look for women’s tennis in a rare big match not involving a Williams sister. “I love Vika ...’’ Stephens said after the match, calling Azarenka a friend. “I’m sure we’ll talk. She should get an oxygen tank and figure it out.’’ Stephens said it sounded less like a medical problem than a personal problem. She was right. That was not an injury. It was a panic attack. Azarenka was falling apart and didn’t know what to do. So she manipulated the injury timeout rules to freeze Stephens, the 19-year-old who beat Serena Williams in the quarterfinals a day earlier. It worked, too. Stephens, serving to stay in the match, lost the game. The defending champ Azarenka will face China’s Li Na in Saturday’s final — Na defeated No. 2-ranked Maria Sharapova 6-2, 6-2 in the earlier semifinal. Stephens had created the first non-Williams sisters American tennis buzz in a while. Well, sort of non-Williams sisters. She beat Serena and created excitement from people who thought they were seeing the heir apparent. It was a little overboard, as Serena hurt her back during the quarterfinal match and could barely move. Stephens is not there yet, but already is a top-20 player with her arrow pointing up. With her win over Serena, she quickly picked up 20,000 Twitter followers, and also received this Tweet from Shaquille O’Neal: “congrats on a great match. Excellent focus n poise. Keep it goin. When u defeat a legend you become a legend. Keep it going’’ She needed one more win to reach the final. But Azarenka crushed her in the first set. Up 5-3 in the second, she served for the match and had five match points. But Azarenka made unforced errors on all five and lost the game. The No. 1 player in the world, and she was so scared she couldn’t get the ball onto the court. Up 5-4, she called for a doctor, as rules allow for an injury. Then, she stood up, and just walked off the court. If she had a real injury, she would have been allowed under the rules to go. Panic breaks are not within the rules. “I almost did the choke of the year,’’ Azarenka said. Look, in every sport there are little tricks of the trade, acceptable ways of violating the rules. Spitballs in baseball. Stuff like that. Walking off the court does not fall under that category. Meanwhile, Stephens mistakenly just sat on her chair the whole time, rather than moving around to stay loose. When Azarenka finally came back, Stephens dumped two serves into the net on the second point. It was the worst look for women’s tennis since 2009, when then-No. 1 Dinara Safina started crying on the court while choking away the French Open final, asking out loud “Why am I such a chicken?’’ Still, this was hardly the first time anyone has faked an injury in tennis to stall. In fact, fake-cramping was becoming such a rampant problem a few years ago that tennis put in rules to stop it. Still, in one day at the Australian Open three years ago, I watched Roger Federer use a fake bathroom break against Nikolay Davydenko, and Novak Djokovic ask to leave against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga so he could go throw up. ""When the sun comes from the side, the ball seems half the size and is just hard to hit,’’ Federer said that day. “I never take toilet breaks, but I thought 'Why not?' ’’ Asked when he noticed something was wrong with Djokovic, Tsonga said this: “Five years ago.’’ Yes, these things irritate the players, who know exactly what’s going on. After the on-court interview when Azarenka said she left because she couldn’t breathe, she said her injuries were her back and chest. She said her timing was bad, that she should have left the court earlier. Right. This was a lesson for Stephens in how the veterans do it. It’s funny, because the first time I went to a Stephens match, she was playing juniors at the US Open. I stood next to her opponent’s coach, who was signaling in instructions even though rules prohibit coaching. It’s OK. Stephens is just 19. She’ll learn what it takes to be a champion.",Raw Data
914,"﻿Bradford will pay tribute to the fans who lost their lives in the Valley Parade fire disaster at Wembley this weekend by wearing specially-made tracksuit tops with the number 56 and the words 'Always With Us' embroidered on the front. PA Sport – Tue, Feb 19, 2013 19:52 GMT The Bantams will make history in Sunday's Capital One Cup showpiece against Barclays Premier League side Swansea by becoming the first club from the bottom tier to appear at Wembley in one of English football's major finals and will mark the occasion by remembering the 56 fans who died in the fire almost 28 years ago. City supporters camped out overnight in the snow last week outside Valley Parade to snap up the last remaining tickets and almost 32,000 will converge on Wembley to celebrate as Phil Parkinson's npower League Two side bid to fulfill the impossible dream. The club's incredible Capital One Cup journey began back in August with a surprise 1-0 win at Notts County in the first round and they trumped that later that same month with a 2-1 victory at Championship high-flyers Watford. Bradford needed a last-minute goal to force extra time in the third round against Burton before defender Stephen Darby struck the winner and Premier League side Wigan were beaten 4-2 on penalties after a goalless 120 minutes in the fourth round before Parkinson's side secured famous wins over Arsenal and Aston Villa, the latter in a two-legged semi-final. Among the travelling army of Bradford supporters heading to Wembley on Sunday will be a 100-strong posse made up of City defender Carl McHugh's family members and friends, who will be making the journey from County Donegal. McHugh, 20, who headed home a crucial third goal in the Bantams' 3-1 first-leg win over Villa at Valley Parade in January, said: ""I've got 111 friends and family coming over, it's going to be a great occasion, we're all looking forward to it. ""I'm not flying them over, Jesus no! They're making their own way over. They gave me the money and I got tickets for them - I didn't pay for 111 tickets!""",Raw Data
915,"Wales' interim head coach Rob Howley confirmed his list of substitutes on Tuesday after giving a resounding vote of confidence last week to the team that beat France 16-6 and ended an eight-Test losing run. Warburton, Wales' 2011 World Cup captain who led them to Six Nations title and Grand Slam glory last season, missed the Stade de France encounter because of a shoulder injury. His fellow back-row forward Ryan Jones took over as skipper, with Justin Tipuric wearing the number seven shirt for a game that saw Wales claim their first victory in Paris since 2005. Warburton is now fit for a return to action, and he will be joined on the bench by Ospreys lock Alun-Wyn Jones. Jones suffered a shoulder injury during the Millennium Stadium defeat against Argentina three months ago, and he subsequently underwent surgery. But he was called into Wales' Six Nations squad last week and has made a couple of comeback appearances for the Ospreys, confirming his fitness. Cardiff Blues lock Lou Reed and Scarlets flanker Aaron Shingler drop out of the match-day 23 on duty against France, with Howley's bench contingent boasting a total of 264 caps. Victory for Wales at the Stadio Olimpico would keep them firmly in the Six Nations title race ahead of their remaining fixtures next month against Scotland and England.

Visit Jay's exclusive page for hot scoops and watch MMAthetics and The After Party. Scott Pioli is out as general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs after four years. The NFL club had already dismissed coach Romeo Crennel earlier this week following a 2-14 season, and Chiefs chairman Clark Hunt said then additional changes could be made. ''I truly apologize for not getting the job done,'' Pioli said. ''The bottom line is that I did not accomplish all of what I set out to do. To the Hunt family - to the great fans of the Kansas City Chiefs - to the players, all employees and alumni, I truly apologize for not getting the job done'' Pioli was hired from the New England Patriots in January 2009 and quickly fired coach Herm Edwards. Pioli turned to Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Todd Haley as head coach and made his first major player move that offseason by acquiring quarterback Matt Cassel from the Patriots following his strong performance in place of the injured Tom Brady. In 2010, the Chiefs won their first AFC West title since 2003. But a poor start the following season cost Haley his job late in 2011, with Crennel promoted from defensive coordinator. ''After several productive conversations, we made the difficult decision to part ways with Scott Pioli and allow him to pursue other opportunities,'' Hunt said in a statement Friday. ''This was a difficult decision for Scott as well,'' Hunt said. ''He has a great deal of appreciation for the history of this franchise, for our players, coaches and employees, and especially our great fans.'' Since the firing, the Chiefs have come to an agreement with former Eagles head coach Andy Reid. Kansas City will have the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, and with five players voted to the Pro Bowl, there are certainly pieces in place for the Chiefs to make rapid improvement.

Rodgers was unwilling to comment on speculation linking the club with Coutinho but it is now understand the club have succeeded with an approach after previous advances were rejected. Coutinho is now expected to travel to Liverpool early next week for a medical and to complete other formalities. Liverpool will also need to apply for a work permit for the player.

920,"Phelps and his former coach, Bob Bowman, share an ownership interest in the Ireland-bred colt, which runs in the colors of Team Valor International. Cerro is trained by Graham Motion, who oversaw 2011 Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom for Team Valor. Cerro ran 1-1/8 miles in 1 minute, 50.29 seconds to win by 2-1/2 lengths. He returned $6 on a $2 win bet. Phelps, who retired after the London Olympics, became interested in horse racing through Bowman, who has bred and owned thoroughbreds for several years and is a friend of Motion. Phelps visited Motion's stable in Elkton, Md., in December. Phelps and Bowman weren't on hand to see Cerro win on Saturday, although they were at Gulfstream to see the colt finish third in a race on Jan. 1. With his swimming career over, take a look back at every medal Michael Phelps has won in his four Olympics. ''We are really excited to be part of Cerro's partnership and see what he can do as he moves along this spring,'' Bowman said. Cerro's next scheduled start at Gulfstream is March 3 in the Palm Beach Stakes. The colt is being pointed toward the Spiral Stakes at Turfway Park on March 24, a race won the past two years by Team Valor and Motion. Phelps and Bowman attended the 2009 Kentucky Derby together and were at the 2011 Preakness, when Animal Kingdom finished second in Phelps' hometown of Baltimore. ''I've always loved racing, and I got out because it just got to be a little much with the coaching. But now that Michael has retired and we're on a little more flexible schedule, we both wanted to have fun with it,'' Bowman said. ''I think he's always seen how much fun I've had with it and wanted to get involved, and this is a great opportunity for us to do it.''

921,"ARLINGTON, Texas We always talk about sports teaching lessons. We probably do this, at least a little, to assuage our guilt about how much of an emphasis we place on what in the end are just games. In light of the types of unfathomable tragedies we seem to face all too often lately 20 tiny children being gunned down by a mad man, crazy religious zealots flying planes into buildings, or smaller scale tragedies like an NFL player killing the mother of his child then himself it is fair to ask what possibly can be learned from a football game or the players who played in it. The answer is a lot, actually. There is more to be learned from Sunday's 27-24 Cowboys victory than what it does to the playoff scenario, or the NFC East race, or Tony Romos legacy. There was a lesson in grace, in personal resilience and in faith. And there was no better teacher on the field than Cowboys cornerback Brandon Carr. He happened to have the interception that led to the game-winning field goal in overtime Sunday. It was the second consecutive week he had a big pick to help the Cowboys win. What is instructive is what Carr laid down sadness and pain to be able to show up for his life. Here is a man who played for the Chiefs, been friendly enough with both Jovan Belcher and Kasandra Perkins that he felt he needed to attend her funeral. Belcher is, of course, the player who killed the mother of his child. Perkins was that mother. He walked out of that funeral to a message that his Cowboys teammate Jerry Brown was dead and another teammate, Josh Brent, was in jail charged with intoxication manslaughter in his death. ""When you talk about adversity, I just fall back on my faith,"" Carr said. ""There are always times where you may doubt something, be hopeless, be nervous, jittery, anxious whatever it is. It is true. Im just going to say it. In those times, I just get down on my knees."" He has been on his knees a lot lately, for Perkins, for Brown and like most of us for those children and teachers in Newtown, Conn. Tragedy has a way of making even the most faithful among us ask, ""why God?"" The questions that follow are how do we carry on? What do we do when the unthinkable happens? And what Carr said as he stood by his locker struck me as very wise. He said he does not believe he is owed joy. He believes he is responsible for trying to spread it using the unique gift God gave him playing the game of football. ""Every day, I get up and have an opportunity to bring something special to the world. Today I had three hours out there on the football field to make people forget what is going on in their lives and give them something to cheer about,"" Carr said. Now, maybe you are a baker or a musician, a bus driver or a teacher, or a sports columnist. What I heard Carr saying is the best thing we can do is spread joy in our own way. It is the whole idea of lighting a candle rather than cursing the darkness. ""I have so much respect for him,"" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said about Carr afterward. He was trying, delicately, to navigate this emerging narrative that the Cowboys were rallying around tragedy. Had they turned Brent's deadly mistake into a solidifying moment? Well, there was Brent on the sideline Sunday, standing with his teammates in street clothes. There apparently was much debate on the broadcast and at halftime as to whether he belonged there. It is a fair debate. I found myself conflicted as well, until Jones explained how he got there. ""(Jerry Brown's) mother asked all of his teammates, she asked everybody to have Josh's back, to support him,"" Jones said. ""She said Jerry (Brown) would want this, would want them to support him."" That is the lesson in grace I was talking about. It is always amazing to me these people who choose forgiveness when anger is the more understandable emotion. One of the more touching moments of this Newtown tragedy was hearing the father of Emilie Parker, one of the murdered children, saying how he was praying for the family of the shooter. ""I cant imagine how hard this experience must be for you,"" Robbie Parker said, ""and I want you to know that our family and our love and support goes out to you as well."" It is an unfathomable display of love in the face of unfathomable tragedy. It speaks to his faith, his compassion. It also speaks to the very best of us. And there are more Robbie Parkers and Stacey Jacksons (Browns mom) than there are those who do these unspeakable things. It is those people who provide hope in moments of doubt. ""I am sure she has had some moments where she has been hurt or angry,"" Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears said of Browns mom. ""Her faith lies in Christ and, when you do that, things tend to not work out how the world views them."" This undoubtedly will make a lot of people uncomfortable, Spears and Carr talking about faith. There are always those who say such a thing does not belong in sports. They will say talk about football. Talk about Romo being the first quarterback in forever to throw for more than 300 yards against this Steelers defense. Talk about the mistakes that Steelers receiver Antonio Brown made that cost them the game. Talk about how the Cowboys can win the NFC East now. Talk about how Cowboys coach Jason Garrett likely saved his job. Talk about how exceptional Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger played until that final interception. Why do you have to bring faith into this? That will be the criticism. Why, is simple. It is because we say we love sports because of the lessons they teach, lessons in personal resilience, in faith, in grace, in pressing on and in staying together as a team even in the worst of times. This is just a game. Maybe we shouldn't read too much into it, but maybe we do because we need important allegories in today's world. And maybe I am silly to take what most people look at as a football game and turn it into something more, but that is what makes sports special.",Raw Data
922,"ATLANTA – The NBA trading deadline turned out to be relatively anticlimactic for the Hawks, as the team elected to retain leading scorer Josh Smith, who will become an unrestricted free agent in July. The Hawks did do a smaller deal, sending three-point shooting specialist Anthony Morrow to Dallas for Dahntay Jones, a 6-foot-6 wing defender that the Hawks have lacked. Morrow, who has an expiring contract, had lost playing time recently to injury and ended up being replaced by rookie John Jenkins, the team's first-round pick in whom the organization has more invested. Despite days of speculation and recent reporting that the Hawks were determined to trade Smith, it ended up not coming about. Smith, who is making in excess of $13 million this season in his ninth season in the league, all in the city where he is a native, has said he wants a contract worth max dollars under the league’s collective bargaining agreement – a sum which the Hawks might not want to pay the 6-9 forward. “Right now, it’s not up to me where I go or what happens,” Smith, 27, said following practice but before the deadline passed, “but in the summertime I do have the flexibility to make my own decisions. It’s going to be my first time being a free agent -- unrestricted -- being able to see what’s out there. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’ve just got to focus on where I am right now.” The Hawks went through in-depth discussions with numerous teams but in the end none of them proved equal to Smith’s talents: He averages 17.2 points 8.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 2.1 blocks. The Hawks are 29-23, sixth in the Eastern Conference, and poised for their sixth straight playoff appearance. “We value Josh and we have said that all year long,” general manager Danny Ferry said. “He’s been important to this program and he’s been important to our year. We were in an unusual situation with Josh’s contract, our cap space and flexibility going forward. Having a good team right now, there were a lot of factors that that played into this. I think the main factor is that we value Josh and he’s been important to our group this year and (if the Hawks) finish the year strong, hopefully we play well and we’re a solid playoff team and we play well in the playoffs.” By ridding themselves of Joe Johnson’s contract over the summer with the trade of him to Brooklyn, the Hawks seemingly freed themselves up not to have to trade Smith in order to rebuild the team. When asked what he thought the Hawks’ chances were of re-signing Smith this summer, Ferry responded that “we’ll address those things from the Hawks’ standpoint this summer and I’m sure Josh will have the opportunity to look at things from his standpoint.” The risk that Ferry took in not dealing Smith is that the Hawks could lose him and receive nothing in return. Of course, one could infer by Ferry’s actions that Ferry would prefer not to make a deal in which he took on a player with a bad contract and that he would rather have the possibility of the substantial cap space vacated by Smith if he does end up leaving. “We’re in a unique situation where we have a competitive roster,” Ferry said. “We have flexibility set up within this new collective bargaining agreement that allows us to look at a lot of different things going forward. I think we can walk into this season when we’re done playing and be organized and make decisions that I think can put us in a good position to grow our program and build a championship-caliber program and a championship team.” Ferry said that in the time leading up to the deadline, he stayed in contact with Smith and his agent, along with other players and their agents whom the Hawks considered dealing. The process seemed to weigh on Smith at the end, as he said he had trouble sleeping last night. “I mean, compounded with the trade rumors and then the loss, it was a disappointing loss,” Smith said of Wednesday’s 103-90 defeat against Miami at Philips Arena. “I went to sleep kind of late last night. It was definitely hard to sleep.” The Atlanta native also said that family members and friends have reached out in recent days to voice strong opinions with him. He was asked if any of them had any funny comments. “It’s really not funny,” Smith said. “This is a serious moment right now. I find humor out of it, but they’re very passionate about what’s happening.” Hawks coach Larry Drew, who was peppered with questions in recent days, said he was trying to keep his team from being distracted. “We have to go about this thing in a regular, in a normal business manner and that is to conduct business as usual,” Drew said.",Raw Data

Hope Solo may or may not have married an ex-NFL player with a long criminal history who may or may not have added to that rap sheet that same day by beating on Solo in a fight over where to live in wedded bliss. A radio report had them exchanging “I dos” late Tuesday. This hardly qualifies as shocking in the wide world of sports, where a trail of T.O. and Kobe, Tiger and Josh Hamilton have disabused us of the belief that athletes lead clean lives. We accept a little dirt around the edges, even relish that ugly, in our male sports superstars. We have no idea what to do when it shows up in the females. We like our female athletes squeaky clean, like Mia Hamm, or crazy hot like Anna Kournikova. We have trouble with somebody like Solo, who has a little bit of crazy in her, a little bit of jerkhole and, yes, a little bit of hot mess. She does not fit the paradigm. She is not necessarily whom we want our little daughters emulating. But Solo can’t be dismissed because she is amazingly talented and infinitely interesting. She intrigues us, keeps us watching because she operates like one of the guys. One of her biggest controversies was born of her calling out her coach for starting Brianna Scurry in goal instead of her during the 2007 World Cup. The decision was all about worshipping at the altar of sacred cows in a sport that does way, way too much of this. Solo was right and did what Kobe, Tom Brady or just about any athlete with an ounce of competitiveness would do. For doing so, she was vilified, ostracized and finally vindicated. The thing about Solo is she always keeps it interesting and, as evidenced by this alleged marriage to former NFL tight end Jerramy Stevens, does not give a flip about what we think. And I find this refreshing. Why should she play by and be judged by a different set of rules? Can't get enough of Hope Solo? Check out her best career shots. This is not to defend the relationship with Stevens. What Solo is doing with a guy like Stevens is beyond me. He reeks of scum bag thanks to a laundry list of accusations ranging from a savage beating of a fellow high schooler to rape in college. There are also countless reckless driving and marijuana busts. And while plea deals were usually reached or prosecutors declined to prosecute in the case of the alleged rape, what is obvious is Stevens always seems to be around trouble. That’s why allegations of abuse with him are so eyebrow-raising. At the very least, a qualified marriage counselor might suggest that if, at any point leading up to the wedding, one of y’all is wearing an orange jumpsuit, arrested and charged with domestic violence, it could be time to reevaluate the relationship. In fairness, a judge later found no probable cause to hold Stevens and he was released with Solo quietly there in attendance. By all accounts, it was a fascinating pre-wedding party at The Kirkland Municipal Court on Tuesday with Seattle TV reporter Chris Daniels live-tweeting the festivities. @ChrisDaniels5 BREAKING: Jerramy Stevens in orange jumpsuit accused of domestic violence, involving Hope Solo. @ChrisDaniels5 BREAKING: Police report says Stevens and Solo were set to get married on Tuesday and argument was about whether they’d live in FL or WA. @ChrisDaniels5 BREAKING: Police report says Marcus Solo (Hope’s brother) said there was altercation in house with unknown person, and involved a stun gun. Sometimes relationships just don't work out, even for sports stars. Here's some of the most explosive sports break-ups. @ChrisDaniels5 Court documents under “length of relationship” says Solo and Jerramy Stevens have been together 2 months. @ChrisDaniels5 Solo did not speak to media. There are multiple indications she will be marrying Jerramy Stevens tonight. Now there is one report saying she did. And while he would not have been my first choice in grooms for Solo, the outrage hits me as just a little bit sexist. It is time we stop expecting every female athlete to be role models and perfect team players, especially if we do not have these same standards for the guys. Yes, Hope Solo is a hot mess. She’s just one of the guys. Jen Floyd Engel covered local sports for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram since 1997 and became a columnist in 2003. Sports opinions? She’s never short of them.

Three points are awarded for an entirely correct scoreline, and one for right result. THE PRIME ATTRACTION MANCHESTER CITY v CHELSEA A few months ago, you’d have branded this a massively influential game in title terms. But both teams have fallen alarmingly off the pace and you don’t hear any complaints from Fergie and company at Old Trafford. So they may well be “playing for second”, come the end of the season. With their respective hopes of grabbing the silverware just about out of the window, perhaps these expensively-assembled combatants will really go for it on Sunday; a draw hardly suits their purposes. City won 2-1 in last season’s Etihad Stadium meeting, courtesy of an 85th-minute winner from Samir Nasri, and three of us anticipate a carbon-copy scoreline. Peter Odemwingie got on the score-sheet after only three minutes of last season’s corresponding fixture, and it rather set the tone for a depressing day for the visiting red-and-whites as they leaked four in total. Sunderland certainly have a score to settle, you feel, because earlier this season they were even thumped 4-2 at home by these foes. But given that recent history, I’m going for another comfortable enough WBA win and two of my rival tipsters see it that way too. Don’t forget the Baggies come off a decent Premiership win at Anfield ... Rob: West Brom 2 Sunderland 0 I could have gone for the more obvious Reading (18th on the table) versus Wigan (19th) ... but this particular fixture hardly lacks desperate aspects, does it? After all, the noose – certainly as far as the increasingly disgruntled Gunners fans are concerned – is tightening around the neck of defiant boss Arsene Wenger, and they really must win here to rekindle hopes of a top-four finish. Villa have their own reasons for urgency, as they are one rung free of the relegation zone, although there have been signs of renewed resolve in the last couple of weeks with a draw and a win for them.

925,"Midway through the fourth quarter of Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, Minnesota power forward Rebekkah Brunson rose in the lane toward the basket with her team trying to mount a rally. Indiana center Erlana Larkins delivered the emphatic rejection. Brunson was knocked to the floor as her shot was swatted, and Minnesota's chance to win the series opener essentially fell down with her. The Lynx were trailing 65-62 with about five minutes left, but they never came closer. The Fever quickly tacked on a layup on the other end and cruised to a 76-70 victory on Sunday night. ''It was what I call a thunder block,'' Fever coach Lin Dunn said. ''She is rising up and she just slides that ball, and it just kind of set the tone: `Hey, we're here for real, and we are ready to play.''' The Lynx, looking to become the league's first repeat champion in 10 years, are at full attention. ''We want to make sure that we're not a team that gets out-hungered. That is really important,'' Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said, adding: ''We've got a lot to overcome, and we'll see if we're able to.'' Game 2 is Wednesday night at Target Center, before the best-of-five series shifts to Indiana for Game 3 on Friday night. ''We've got a lot of competitors on our team that really hate to lose, so I guess in Game 2 you'll see the difference,'' Lynx shooting guard Seimone Augustus said. ''You'll see us come out and be a little bit more aggressive from start to finish. We're going to play and give it all that we have.'' The Fever spent Monday getting massages at a spa before reconvening for practice on Tuesday. The two-day layoff between games probably wasn't enough for veteran shooting guard Katie Douglas, though. After spraining her left ankle in the last game of the Eastern Conference finals, Douglas was missing from Game 1. Dunn said she's improving but unlikely to play Wednesday. ''Hopeful for Friday,'' Dunn said. So the Fever will continue to lean on their tallest ladies, with Larkins and Tamika Catchings inside. They combined for 36 points, 21 rebounds and five blocks in Game 1 and held Lynx post players Brunson and Taj McWilliams-Franklin to a total of 16 points and 14 rebounds. ''We had a great week of practice. We went over everything we could have possibly gone over, but they came out and they were ready to win,'' Brunson said. ''They played great.'' Catchings is still chasing her first WNBA championship at age 33. Larkins was out of the league the last two years before joining the Fever this season. No matter the perspective or the experience, the motivation is the same. ''When you've never won a title you approach it a little bit different than trying to defend a title,'' Dunn said. ''We've got players that had a taste of the finals in 2009, and they know what it was like and how close they came. It was almost like they had their hands on the trophy and it got snatched away.'' The Fever lost to the Phoenix Mercury in five games in 2009. So they're not comfortable by simply taking the home-court advantage. ''We know that they're going to come out Wednesday, and they're going to be a much different team and much better,'' Catchings said. ''And for us, we have to continue to get better too.'' Added point guard Erin Phillips: ''They're going to come in so hungry, so aggressive. They're the defending champions, and they're here for the second time for a reason. They're a great team. ... We can't just sit around and be satisfied that we won Game 1 and give ourselves a pat on the back, and that's it. It's going to be a much harder game.'' The Lynx pride themselves on their bounce-back ability, so they're expecting the same: a more aggressive performance. ''I'm hoping we won't lose two in a row,'' Augustus said. ''We've been good at that point, bouncing back in tough-game situations, and this is the perfect example, the perfect time for us to be able to bounce back and go to Indiana and steal one on the road or steal two on the road and pull this championship out.''",Raw Data

927,"﻿Scoreless through the season's first three games, the Kings' line of Kopitar, Dustin Brown and Justin Williams had an extra jump against the Coyotes, combining for four points. Kopitar scored both of his goals in the second period, with Brown and Williams getting an assist on each. Jake Muzzin scored his first NHL goal and had an assist and Jeff Carter also scored for Los Angeles (1-2-1). The Kings had eight players with at least a point and matched their season total for goals to avoid their first four-game winless start since 1997-98. ''Every time you're on the road, you need a team game,'' Kopitar said. ''I know everybody's saying that, but that's just how it is. You need to roll four lines.'' The Coyotes (1-4-0) need some defense. Phoenix won the Pacific Division title last season behind a tight-checking style and opportunistic goals. The Coyotes are scoring more this season, but have had too many defensive breakdowns and been too loose with the puck in their own end to start the season with four losses in five games. Mikkel Boedker and Shane Doan scored for the Coyotes, who have allowed 20 goals in five games. ''When there is a mistake you've got to clean up for each other,'' Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said. ''Right now, there's not much cleaning up going on.'' The Kings and Coyotes already didn't like each other much and the hatred intensified during a testy Western Conference finals last season. Los Angeles won the series in five games on the way to its first Stanley Cup, but not before the teams traded blows, including a hit by Brown in the clinching game that knocked Phoenix defenseman Michal Rozsival out and left the Coyotes fuming. The rematch pitted two teams trying to recapture last season's magic. The Kings' Cup defense got off to a shaky start, beginning with a 5-2 thrashing by Chicago after raising the championship banner at the Staples Center. Goalie Jonathan Quick hasn't been the same player who won the Conn Smythe Trophy and was a Vezina finalist a year ago, giving up 10 goals in three games. He stopped 31 of 33 shots Saturday. Looking for the latest on the Coyotes? Get the inside slant, stats, scores, schedules and more scoops right here. Besides the Kings' top line having a hard time getting started this seasonl, Los Angeles also opened the season 0 for 19 on the power play and blew a chance for its first win of the season against the Oilers, giving up a goal with 4.7 seconds left before losing 2-1 in overtime. The Coyotes have only been marginally better. Phoenix has struggled to find the defense-first style that led the first NHL division title in franchise history, giving up 16 goals in four games. Goalie Mike Smith struggled the first two games before suffering a lower-body injury against Columbus, and the Coyotes followed up their only win — against the Blue Jackets — by blowing two-goal lead in the third period of a 5-3 loss at San Jose on Thursday. The atmosphere wasn't quite the same for the conference finals rematch, but it certainly was entertaining. The Coyotes killed off a two-man advantage that lasted two minutes in the first period, about half of that with Boyd Gordon playing without his stick. They got a 5-on-3 of their own in the second period and capitalized when Boedker punched in a rebound past Quick after a shot by Oliver Ekman-Larsson hit the post. Kopitar gave LA's top line its first points of the season in the second period, taking a pass from Brown and beating Jason LaBarbera with a wrister from the slot. He followed Phoenix's first score with his second goal of the period, one-timing a drop pass from Williams, who had a semi-breakaway and lured LaBarbera to the side of the crease. ''It's good to get it out of the way because you do think about it,'' Kopitar said of his first goals. Carter made it 3-1 later in the period, punching in a rebound on a shot by Simon Gagne, back after being a healthy scratch the previous two games. The Coyotes got just what they needed to open the third period when Doan scored 22 seconds in by gathering a pass from behind the goal by Lauri Korpikoski and flipping it past Quick. But Phoenix continued to give up good scoring chances and Muzzin put the Kings up 4-2 with a hard shot from near the blue line that appeared to catch LaBarbera off-guard. ''To be honest, I didn't really see it go in,'' Muzzin said of his first goal. ''When the guys came over, I was just kind of laughing because it was one of those hope wristers that made it through.'' The Coyotes thought they had cut the lead to one with 39 seconds left on a rebound by Radim Vrbata, but the officials waved it off, saying the whistle had blown because they believed the puck was still under Quick. Phoenix also had a goal by David Moss disallowed because of goalie interference earlier in the game. ''That's the breaks we're getting right now,'' Tippett said. ''We've got to overcome it.'' Notes: Coyotes C Martin Hanzal returned after missing two games with a lower-body injury. D Rostislav Klesla missed his third straight game with a lower-body injury and C Matthew Lombardi was out with an upper-body injury suffered against the Sharks on Thursday. ...

But thanks to the rapid growth of the NFL and fantasy football, games like FOX Fantasy Survivor can feed your craving for “win or go home” competition seven months early. Thousands of football fans signed up and participated in the FOX Fantasy Survivor game last season. The hope is, with cash prizes on the line, we can eclipse that mark in 2012. The premise is simple: pick one (1) team who you believe is going to win that week. The survivor catch remains that once you pick a team to win, you can’t pick that team again for the rest of the season. The good news is, even if you lose, you are still eligible to win cash prizes. To assist you with your survivor selections, the FOXSports.com’s fantasy football staff will provide you their picks for the week. Just remember the mantra: survive and advance. In a month, you could be $2,000 richer. Fowler and Beall - Colts (Andy Luck's remarkable rookie season will continue on into the playoffs. The quarterback found his favorite target, Reggie Wayne, in the back of the end zone to break a 13-13 tie in the fourth quarter. But the best news? Chuck Pagano returns to the sidelines in Week 17 after missing most of the season battling cancer. Chuck Strong!) Halpin - Patriots (It wasn't a pretty road win for the Patriots. Jacksonville had plenty of chances, including a late fourth-quarter drive that would have tied things up at 23 and forced overtime, but Chad Henne's third interception of the game locked things up for the Pats as they target homefield in the playoffs.) Harmon - Panthers (Carson Palmer, Terrelle Pryor and Matt Leinart. THESE are your 2012 Oakland Raiders quarterbacks. Another loss for the silver and black as Darren McFadden's legacy is quickly becoming one of the big ""what-ifs"" of all-time.) This game should wrap up the Norv Turner-era in San Diego. Last week's game against the Panthers tied a bow on Carson Palmer's season as the quarterback cracked some ribs and was dealt a bruised lung. As of press time, head coach Dennis Allen was still deciding between starting Matt Leinart or Terrelle Pryor. Ryan Mathews is out with his second broken collarbone of the season. Gosh, the more you write about these two teams, the more you wonder how they won a combined 10 games this season. Sloppy for certain, but a San Diego win as Norv leaves the building. Beall - Redskins over Cowboys It's winner-take-all when the Redskins and Cowboys get together in Week 17 as the NFC East division title somehow slipped through the New York Giants' hands. The last time these two teams played each other, it was Thanksgiving Day and Dallas was without Demarco Murray. The Cowboys rushed for 35 yards as a team that day, while Tony Romo and RG3 combined for nearly 750 passing yards and seven touchdown passes. In the end, the rookie won the road test, 38-31. Halpin - Bills over Jets If you watch this game with great interest, you REALLY love football. Even Tebow Time, a must-watch in 2011, isn't appointment viewing with the way the Jets' mismanaged their quarterback situation in 2012. Harmon - Seahawks over Rams Harmon was schocked, SHOCKED!, to learn Seattle was still in his pro football survivor bullpen this late into the season. Russell Wilson and company still have an outside chance of winning the NFC West division title and with a lot to play for, expect Pete Carroll to strive for 50 points again.",Raw Data
929,"On Friday night at Staples Center, the Lakers and Clippers will face off for the second time this season, and Los Angeles' long-time second-tier franchise is in a position to take a 2-0 series lead over its more glorious, more celebrated neighbor. That alone makes the game a must-watch. But it's the fact that the Clippers are poised to compete over and perhaps win the future that's the most startling fact in their now very real rivalry. Since moving to Los Angeles in 1984, the Clippers have been mostly an NBA doormat. That lowly reality has only been more acutely felt by Clippers fans because of their team's proximity to one of the league's shiniest, brightest objects: the Lakers of Kareem and Magic, of Shaq and Kobe, of Kobe and Phil. The Lakers have won eight titles since the Clippers arrived in the city of stars and could-have-beens. The Clippers, by comparison, have made the playoffs only five times during that stretch There are a lot of reasons for that discrepancy, but one is that the Lakers have always been able to win the present while knowing they can just as easily own the future. Now, though, the Lakers sit at 15-16, with Kobe Bryant calling out his team seemingly every week for something new (this week it's that they're an ""old damn team""), Dwight Howard seeming a mismatched part and the purple-and-gold brand feeling a little the worse for wear. Even Magic Johnson, Lakers legend and maestro of Showtime, has dubbed the 25-8 Clippers the bearers of that legacy. If that's not enough of an upside-down basketball world, try this one out: As much as the Clippers are poised to dominate the Lakers in the present, they're equally well-positioned to own the future as well. The Lakers are locked into old damn guys like Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace for this and the next season, as well as Steve Nash through 2014-15. The cap space they'll have after that will presumably go to Howard, whom they hope to entice into a max contract after this season. That's a roster, obviously, that isn't working particularly well. But the Clippers, fresh off a 17-game winning streak, have young star Blake Griffin under contract through 2014-15, as well as DeAndre Jordan, a very affordable Jamal Crawford (less than $6 million per year) and the utterly cheap Eric Bledsoe (peaking at $3.6 million). That's a pretty good nucleus, one that should be firmed up even better if they can entice their star, Chris Paul, to sign his own max extension after this season. The Clippers also get Lamar Odom's onerous $8.2 million contract expunged after this season, and Caron Butler's $8 million deal is done after 2013-14. The Clippers also have an advantage in retaining Paul that the Lakers don't have in keeping Dwight, a huge chess piece in the battle for the future: the situation of each team's respective head coach. For the Clippers, the fact that Vinny Del Negro's contract is up at the end of the year couldn't be better timed. They can offer Paul a huge voice in who the next coach is as part of his decision to remain a Clipper. If he likes Vinny, sure, why not, Vinny stays. But if Paul wants someone else, well, the Clippers can give it to him with a minimum amount of drama. That, and the fact this is a team already built to CP3's expectations, means the future looks rosy in Clipper land. The Lakers' situation is more complicated. Mike D'Antoni is under contract, so any say Howard would have in the head coach after this season in exchange for his services would be ugly a political and publicity nightmare for a player who already has had his fill. Howard would have Steve Nash to deal with, to say nothing of Kobe's say in the matter. And this team, at least right now and with this coach, is decidedly not built around Howard and only Howard. This isn't to say Howard won't stay, or that Paul won't go. But the Clippers have an advantage in retaining their future stars that the Lakers don't. The other interesting point for the future is that the Lakers have no one under contract in 2014-15 other than Nash, who will be 40 when the season begins and 41 when it ends. That means the Lakers are banking on a free-agent haul, and there are certainly free agents to be had that year: LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Zach Randolph and Danny Granger are among those who could decide it would be cool to be a Laker. And Kobe Bryant will also be available, probably at a discount, if he still wants to play and chase championships. But that's a tricky proposition, betting the future on the idea the past will repeat itself. The Lakers have always been able to attract talent. And two of the team's linchpins for greatness Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant have been with the team throughout their careers. For the Lakers to compete against the Clippers going forward, they have to hope that for the next two years this ""old damn team"" gets younger, gets better and gets to it. And, starting in 2014-15, they have to hope they can attract the right players to line up with (presumably) Howard. There's no doubt that a team featuring LeBron James, Dwight Howard, an older Kobe Bryant as a role player and assorted parts would be a fierce force in the league. But there are a lot of ifs in there. There's also this. If the Lakers, and LeBron, have learned anything, it's this: Even with great talent it takes time a season, or two to learn to be great together. So while the Lakers hope to speed up their learning curve this season, and then do it all over again in 2014-15, the Clippers are poised to have the same nucleus year after year, learning, together perhaps, the alchemy it takes to turn a team into a champion. Yes, Friday night's game will be a good one indeed, a real testament to how far the Clippers have come in their battle to dominate the Lakers in the market and the Western Conference. But look closely, and you'll see a fight for the future going in their direction as well.",Raw Data
930,"With just three games left in the season for the Pistons, I know some casual fans might look at the overall record and wonder how much progress they’ve really made. The bottom line, I believe, is that they’ve made a great deal of progress. With a new coach, a new system and a new point guard, it’s no surprise this team started slowly. That would be an understatement – 4 and 20 is about as slow as you could start. But this team never gave up on themselves, the coaches never gave up on them and, after that 4 and 20 start, the Pistons were very competitive. They had a blowout loss or two, but they also managed a blowout win or two. For the most part, they slugged it out with everybody – even the teams we think are going to compete for the NBA title – and they’re going to finish very close to or over .500 after their slow start. If you look at the last two-thirds of the season and carry that through to next year – even without any draft choices or any changes to the roster – you’d say these guys can compete for a playoff spot next season. Not only that, they play hard, they play smart and they play together. They have young players who are getting better and they’re fun to watch. A big part of what should make Pistons fans feel very encouraged about the future starts away from the court. The Pistons forever were a very stable franchise under the ownership and the guidance, really, of Bill Davidson, one of the greatest sports owners of all time who in the end won championships in the NBA, WNBA and even the NHL. When Mr. D died and the franchise was put up for sale, there was instability. Enter Tom Gores after at least a year of uncertainty and, frankly, everything has changed now. I don’t think you can underestimate that, from the players to the coaches to everybody involved in Pistons basketball. There is now stability. Everybody knows who the boss is and that the boss is more than willing to do what it takes to put a winning product on the floor. He cares about the franchise and cares about this team and is in it for the long haul. That makes all the difference in the world to all of us who care so much about the Pistons. Now add to that a rock-solid coach in Lawrence Frank, who I believe has the near-perfect disposition for coaching at this level, plus a staff of assistant coaches who are great teachers and a team that truly has three or four young cornerstones in place. It’s pretty easy to get excited about the future, near-term and long-term. When you talk about cornerstones, you start with Greg Monroe, who should win the Most Improved Player award this year. Although there are some great candidates elsewhere, his numbers to me seem the most compelling. He’s among the leaders in offensive rebounds and is a truly solid option in the paint who can score with either hand and is a nightmare to guard on most nights. Then you go to rookie point guard Brandon Knight, who has proven beyond all reasonable doubt that he’s going to be a standout point guard in our league for years to come. Exhibit A would be the game he had against the Cleveland Cavaliers. You can’t play any better than he did against the Cavs – 11 of 12 shooting, 28 points and seven assists. Everybody knows the talent Rodney Stuckey has and the fact he can take it to the basket with the best of the guards in the greatest league in the world. And you can’t help but notice the energy boost and the productivity that Jonas Jerebko gives you at either small forward or power forward when he comes off the bench. I look at that group of four and I’d be surprised if the Pistons let any of them get away anytime soon and I don’t think they want to be anywhere else. They all can see the light at the end of the tunnel and they want to be here when the Pistons are back in the playoffs and competing for NBA titles. Add to that the fact the Pistons will get themselves a good choice in what the experts say is a very deep draft and I look for Joe Dumars to find another cornerstone type of player to follow Greg and Brandon. If you do that, and keep some other players who have been very productive this season, especially a glue-guy veteran like Tayshaun Prince, I think they’ll truly be able to play with anybody next year. I found the Chicago game earlier this week tremendously encouraging. The Bulls had everything to play for, they had everybody healthy and they were very lucky to beat the Pistons in overtime. I think you’d be hard-pressed if you were an oddsmaker to give anybody a better chance to win the NBA title than the Bulls. If you can play with what appears to be the best team in the league and they leave The Palace lucky to win a game that was important to them, you can see just how far the Pistons have come this season.",Raw Data
931,"The wonderful thing about sports is when somebody does something special and you start to go through the history books, you find out just how significant it really is. Greg Monroe has now put up eight straight double-double games and youve got to go back to 1996 to find another Pistons player whos done that. When you find out that the player who did it was one of the most complete players to ever wear Pistons blue, Grant Hill, it puts things in perspective for Greg and allows the rest of us to maybe really take a closer look at how talented and how tough-minded and determined Greg Monroe really is when he steps on the court. Hes more special than I think anybody around the league understands. The coaches are the ones who vote for the reserves for the All-Star game and I think it would be a major upset if next year they dont vote Greg for one of those reserve spots. They see him night in and night out and have to game plan against him. Maybe the fact hell have to spend most of the rest of the season out there as the Pistons lone true big man because of Andre Drummonds back injury will jack up his numbers even a little bit more. Its been fun watching Gregs game take off. We knew when he first came here that he had a great feel for the game, was able to see the floor and see his teammates like few big men, let alone young big men. And he still has that. Theres always the possibility if you run too many people at him that hes going to find the open man, but beyond that hes not a one- or two-move guy at this point. Hes able to eat up space between the high post even the foul line extended and the basket in a hurry, spin either way and shoot with either hand and he has so much momentum carrying him to the basket that if somehow the shot doesnt go, hes going to follow it. Hes become a real force on the offensive glass. Thats hard work. But thats what Greg Monroe does. Hes probably never going to get oohs and ahhs, especially in other peoples buildings, but that doesnt mean hes not becoming an elite basketball player. Were very, very lucky to have him in Detroit. You can build a winning team around Greg Monroe. I would imagine Joe Dumars gets calls about Greg all the time and Im sure his answer is unavailable. Weve seen enough already this year of Greg and Andre Drummond on the court together to paint a pretty rosy picture for the Pistons in the future in the paint. There are not too many times you go up against a team that has big men who do as much around the basket as Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond. Theyll get better together the more they play together. The injury to Andre certainly has slowed down that process, but I think the coaches and Joe D have seen enough to show them that with those two guys on the court you can play against anybodys bigs in the league and often dominate at the very least, hold your own. Its too bad Andre suffered the injury, but well see even more from Greg until Andre comes back. Hell have the same kind of responsibilities he had last year before Andre got here. There wont be that big man boost off the bench although Slava Kravtsov showed in the big fourth-quarter comeback against Washington that he, at the very least, can give the Pistons an intimidating presence in the paint defensively but weve seen what Andre can do. Hes exciting, hes powerful, hes enthusiastic and hes only going to get better. Im sure that gives Greg a lift, to know that someday, when Andre really comes into his own and Greg is already at the top of his game, these guys could dominate together. Then you have Jose Calderons influence. To get Jose here has been good for everybodys game. He will find you in the right spot and get you a good shot. Frankly, this is only going to get better when he really and truly knows everything he needs to know about all his teammates. But it seems like with Greg Monroe, that chemistry is already there. Greg has to love playing with him. That ball is on the money, its catchable and it leads him to more often than not making easy power moves around the basket. It helps Greg do what he does best. This Jose Calderon has been a point guards point guard for years. Hes almost at the perfect age. He will make you better and its clear he already has made his teammates better. On most nights, the Pistons have played very well since hes come here. Its going to be a pleasure for the final two months of the season to watch Jose and Greg continue to build that chemistry into something special.",Raw Data

The highly anticipated Patriots and Texans showdown never materialized on MNF, ultimately done in by Tom Brady. The Patriots quarterback dropped the showdown to its knees early. It was done by the middle of the third quarter, finished by Brady’s fourth touchdown pass in what ultimately ended up being a 42-14 buttkicking of Houston rather than a showdown. He now has 29 this season and almost 4,000 yards and 10 W's. This would be The NFL MVP except for two things: 1. Peyton Manning returned from what many in the NFL believed to be career-ending neck surgery. Included in this doubt were his Colts who released him this offseason. He returned to be really, really good, Manning-level good and lead the Broncos to the playoffs. As a result, many have his name already penciled in as MVP. 2. We are talking about Brady and, for whatever reason, we tend to overlook consistent greatness when figuring year-end awards. This is not to say Peyton is a guarantee. Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has gathered steam in recent weeks and rightfully so. He has been amazing, another level beyond amazing when you consider he is doing this on a reconstructed knee. Manning’s replacement in Indy, Andrew Luck, has been mentioned, as has Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan and Texans defensive end J.J. Watt. All of them provide good alternate theories. None will win. This MVP is coming down to Manning vs. Brady, which is delicious considering how many great battles these eventual Hall of Famers have allowed us to be bystanders to over the years. And so we have to decide between Brady being Brady or Manning shutting up all of his doubters. Guess who will win? Before we just hand this to Manning, though, let us take a moment to consider the candidacy of not-so-young Brady. His 2012 argument, while lacking in emotion and narrative, has games like Monday. It was not simply the throws he made, the pass to Brandon Lloyd in particular. It was not simply how he handled what until Monday had been a ruthless Texans defense — look at how he handled a dirty pocket on the long pass to Wes Welker that set up New England’s first touchdown. It was not about how he had a one-loss Houston basically done early in the third quarter after yet another touchdown pass. It was not even his fist pump after he went sliding for the first down to end the third quarter, although, that was really cool to see. It is just how often he does things to win games and how rare it is he does things to lose them. He has four interceptions this season. Four. This is insane when you consider really good quarterbacks in this league, guys like Tony Romo, have done that in a game. And herein lies the beauty and the downfall of Brady. He is so consistently great that we forget to reward him for his mastery of his position. No really, we do. Guess how many MVPs Brady has won in his 13 seasons? Two. How is that even possible? He has had an argument almost every single year he has played, an argument made by stats and Patriots W's and Super Bowls and just overall greatness. This is not a case of him being overlooked because he flies under the radar. The guy is married to Gisele. He is not flying below any radars. His other significant other probably plays a bigger role in the under-awarding of Brady. The tendency is to say “Well, he has Bill Belichick,” which is fine but Belichick is such a good coach in part because he has Brady. They are intertwined, and this should not cost Brady what I believe to be a deserved MVP this season. If he does not win, this is more about our tendency to overlook consistent greatness is favor of “the story.” Brady’s story is old. We have heard it 1,000 times about how he was not drafted until the sixth round. He is no longer an underdog so this story does not really even resonate. Nor is Brady coming back from anything like Peyton or Peterson. He was not cut by a franchise he had been synonymous with like Peyton, or left for football dead like Peyton, or missed an entire season with a neck injury like Peyton. He is just really, really good. The numbers suggest he has been better than Peyton. And that is the MVP. We would be wise not to forget him.",Raw Data
933,"Theres nobody who works at The Palace, from Joe Dumars to the young men who clean up the locker room after games, who doesnt understand what Rasheed Wallace means to the Pistons. But sometimes it takes the absence of somebody to understand his true worth. Rasheed didnt play against the Knicks the other night and the Pistons lost in overtime despite unbelievable performances from a lot of players, Antonio McDyess especially. And Rasheed wont be in uniform tonight against Toronto, either, and that will make it a tough win for the Pistons even though the Raptors have been struggling. When you dont have Rasheed Wallace on the floor for major minutes during a game, no matter how hard you try to make up for it, your defense is going to suffer. Hes a great low-post defender, very smart and with quick hands and he knows exactly what to do with each of his low-post matchups against some of the great players in the game. The most important thing about defense overall is playing good team defense and you cant play good team defense if you dont communicate. When you have a guy on the back line defensively who is calling out defensive adjustments and he has an ultra-high basketball IQ, your defense will be more than good enough to win on most nights. When youre talking about Rasheed the basketball player and his place in recent NBA history and I dont know if Im recent anymore, because I go back 33 years youll see one of the most-talented half-dozen power forwards during my time as an NBA broadcaster. Rasheed wouldnt even care about this, by the way, which is maybe the best thing about him. Hes a guy you really have to watch for a while to fully appreciate. Despite all his energy on the court and how much he inspires the crowd and his teammates, he isnt intentionally flamboyant. And he doesnt really care what his individual stats are. In that way, hes a great, great teammate all he really wants to do is win. But if you look at his skill set, it would be hard to find somebody who can do everything Rasheed can do, who thinks the game like Rasheed, and add to that his unselfishness. Hes really a pleasure to watch and a great guy to be around. Hes not just a great teammate, hes a great part of the Pistons family. Rasheed Wallace is truly one of the most misunderstood athletes of our time, without question. Fans see his emotional reactions to bad calls or even questionable calls and they see a guy who they think maybe isnt as respectful of the officials as he should be. I see a guy who is very respectful of the good officials and is constantly complimenting referees when they make good calls. Hes just smart enough to know what a bad call is and hes not going to let you get away with it. Sometimes, as hard as he tries not to, hell say something to an official and an official reacts to him and hell probably react back to the official and thats where he gets in trouble. But talk to his teammates and coaches and youll find out what kind of guy he is. Joe Dumars did that and brought him here without reservation because he knew that anybody who coached him or played with him respected his game and loved having him on their team. Its the times when fans dont see Rasheed that really shows his true character. Hes a guy who would rather do things under the radar, whether its finding coats for people when its cold out or helping schoolkids fund a project. He really cares about the community and wants to help the underdog. Not only that, but he has been a great mentor for an awful lot of young players over the years. Jermaine ONeal was probably destined to be at least a good player, but Ill guarantee not as good as he turned out to be after all those years playing behind Rasheed in Portland and learning from one of the best in the game. Sometimes people dont realize how much time it takes to stay after practice or to just catch a conversation with a guy again and again about areas where he needs work. Rasheed is absolutely committed to making young players better. And I think his feel for the game rubs off on teammates, and as I said earlier, what he does defensively, both individual and making sure the team defense is right, is immeasurable. If you ask people who work at The Palace the crew on Roundball Two or anybody in that group of unsung heroes that are important parts of the Pistons family who the most courteous and friendly players are, Rasheed would be at the top of everybodys list. And thats something you cant measure. But if you add that to the mix, he becomes a very valuable player. And Im certainly glad hes in Pistons blue.",Raw Data
934,"MILWAUKEE In a matter of moments, Saturday's basketball game between Providence and Marquette went from a Big East battle to a battle with a little beast. With 11:23 left in the second half, a bat made its first appearance of many that wreaked havoc at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. Repeatedly, officials stopped play while waiting for the bat to leave the court area. The second time it appeared, Providence forward Sidiki Johnson was nearly hit in the face and fell to the floor while trying to defend himself from the flying menace. ""I think everyone was scared the bat was going to bite them,"" Marquette point guard Junior Cadougan said. ""At one point we got so mad that everybody was throwing towels at the bat. We were all scared, even the refs were scared."" In all, the game was delayed four times as the bat dive-bombed the court, fearlessly flying close to players, referees and fans. During one stoppage, the majority of players and coaches were on the court along with arena officials trying to throw towels and warm-up shirts at the bat. Providence coach Ed Cooley took that time to run around the court with his clipboard, trying to swat the bat out of the air. At the under-eight-minute media timeout, Bradley Center officials decided to turn off all of the arena lights including the main scoreboard and ribbon board to coerce the bat to flee the court area. The Bradley Center DJ got creative and played Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" as the arena looked like it was hosting a concert when fans took out their cellphones and swayed them like lighters. After the lights were turned down, the bat which already has a Twitter account disappeared from the playing area. Though the bat may have been funny to some, Marquette felt the constant stoppages killed its momentum. Up 58-42 following two Davante Gardner free throws, the Golden Eagles allowed Providence to go on a 6-0 run right after the bat's first appearance, and eventually the Friars cut the lead to 61-55 with 7:36 to play. Four minutes of clock time took nearly a half hour to complete. ""That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,"" Marquette guard Trent Lockett said. ""It was almost frustrating because we felt like we had momentum, and every time we had a play going our way that dang bat came back. It's definitely an experience and I have a story to tell now."" Lockett credited Marquette coach Buzz Williams for ignoring the bat during the stoppages and focusing on the game. Williams wasn't so sure he did his best coaching, however. ""I probably didn't handle it right,"" Williams said. ""I've coached in a lot of bad gyms, but I've never seen a bat in a gym. It was kind of funny to begin with, but then it was like: Damn the bat, we have to win. There's going to be a winner and a loser in the record book, and they aren't going to put an asterisk (saying) there was a bat."" ""I thought our kids handled it like kids initially. I thought we got back a little bit in a groove, but I don't think we ever got back to where we were at."" The Golden Eagles eventually took control of the game and regained a 16-point lead with 2:21 to play. They ended up winning, 81-71. Clearly frustrated with his team's performance, Providence coach Ed Cooley sat at the podium and quickly answered ""no"" when asked if there were any bright spots in the loss. The more he thought about the question, he eventually found one. ""There wasn't one bright spot in the game other than Batman and Robin flying around the damn building,"" Cooley said. ""That actually was pretty funny. That was really comical. I think the officials were more afraid than anybody. It was a momentum breaker. I think Batman took their crowd out of the game a little bit. I think that helped us there.""",Raw Data
935,"Kyle Walker To many, Walker was a surprise choice for the PFA Young Player of the Year last season with the right-back pipping Sergio Aguero to the award. Walker's campaign ended in disappointment as Spurs missed out on a Champions League spot and a toe injury ruled him out of Euro 2012. Those setbacks may have played a part in the 22-year-old's performance level plummeting at the start of this season, as Walker committed several glaring errors - such as a costly mistake in the build-up to Chelsea's fourth goal at White Hart Lane - in Spurs' steady start under Andre Villas-Boas. The right-back's form has gradually stabilised, but it still seems as though his strengths lie in the physical side of his game, rather than decision-making and tactical intelligence. There is still plenty of room for improvement. Patrice Evra Evra is not the only defender to divide opinion at Old Trafford, but the left-back's form over the past two seasons has been more of a concern than the gradual progress of Jonny Evans and Rafael, who have both been impressive this year despite Manchester United's poor defensive record. Evra is also enjoying a good campaign after cutting out most of the errors that pockmarked his previous performances and United's vice-captain has also weighed in with four goals and four assists in his 22 appearances. The arrival of Alexander Buttner may have been the boost Evra needed (until he saw the Dutchman play, at least) and the 31-year-old seems to have restored the fans' faith with a string of influential displays. There has still been the occasional boob, but Evra typifies the intent of this United side to beat their opponents by relentless attacking rather than strict adherence to defensive duties. It suits him just fine. Chico Chico has certainly divided my own opinion since his 2million summer move to Swansea. The centre-back's reckless red card for a dangerous challenge on Louis Saha in September's draw with Sunderland suggested he could be an accident waiting to happen, but since then the 25-year-old has established himself as the Swans' most important defender. Chico's impressive form alongside Ashley Williams has helped Michael Laudrup's side climb to ninth in the Premier League and reach their first domestic cup final, as Chelsea became the first team not to score in a League Cup semi-final since Watford in 2005. Not only is Chico in the top ten for tackles, interceptions and clearances per game this season, he is also careful in his distribution and Laudrup will hope Little Boy Flowers continues to bloom. David Luiz Luiz could soon become a midfielder who divides opinion after being moved into the Makelele role by Rafa Benitez at the Club World Cup and the Brazil international has proved the perfect foil to Frank Lampard in his new position. But as Alex Hess says here, much of the criticism levelled at Luiz for his performances in defence has been unfair. The 25-year-old has eradicated most of the errors that caused Gary Neville to describe him as a PlayStation player last season, and he played a key role in Chelsea's Champions League triumph after returning from injury to face Bayern Munich in the final. His future at Chelsea (in terms of where he will play) depends largely on the interim manager's, but whatever happens to Benitez Chelsea have been rewarded for their patience with Luiz, who has now established himself as one of the most important players at the club. Laurent Koscielny In terms of ability, Koscielny is clearly a better defender than both Thomas Vermaelen and Per Mertesacker. But this season the France international seems to have regressed, with more errors than ever before and a string of unconvincing displays over the past few months. Koscielny's red card against Manchester City summed up his occasional brain fades, and Arsene Wenger should be worried that Edin Dzeko - who is hardly renowned for his movement - managed to get the wrong side of the defender so easily. Arsenal have conceded 17 goals in the 13 league matches Koscielny has started this season and while he is not the only blameworthy defender at the Emirates, the 27-year-old's form remains a concern. He will need to improve quickly if Arsenal are to stand a chance of securing fourth.",Raw Data
936,"That thought had to be coursing through Staples Center on Tuesday night, when the curtain came up on the NBA season and the new-look Lakers, whose star-studded lineup looked . . . a lot like the one that didn’t win any of its eight preseason games. This newly reloaded juggernaut, with the additions of Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, might be the center of attention in the NBA for an altogether different reason after being soundly beaten by the Dirk Nowitzki-less Dallas Mavericks, 99-91, an outcome that will no doubt set Lakers fans on a campaign to a) scrap the Princeton offense, b) fire coach Mike Brown, c) hire Shaquille O’Neal to teach Dwight Howard how to shoot free throws or d) all of the above. If that wasn’t quite the introduction Howard was hoping for, he learned afterward that he’s not in Orlando anymore when one of the first questions he was asked was whether he was embarrassed. “Embarrassed?” Howard asked, either incredulous or not sure he had heard the question correctly. The older hands around Lakerland knew better than to sweat the loss, figuring that once everyone learns the offense and actually tries on defense, everything will work itself out. “It’s like when I go on a date – it’s going to take time,” said Metta World Peace, who presumably scores at a more efficient clip on the singles scene than he did with his 1-for-8 shooting against Dallas. But he was not alone. Nash made just 3 of 9 shots, and acknowledged that he was tentative directing the offense – unsure when to get into the Princeton, which is predicated on movement off the ball, or run the pick-and-roll sets that helped make him a two-time MVP. Howard made 3 of 14 free throws, the frustration showing in his carping at the officials, a flagrant foul and his exit in the final minutes after being called for an offensive foul. Even the good news – that Kobe Bryant, sidelined 10 days with a sprained foot, had 22 points on 11 of 14 shooting – was tempered by the possibility that he will not play in Portland on Wednesday. Dallas owner Mark Cuban, whose summer plans to land Howard and/or Deron Williams fizzled, was giddy after a team that got major contributions from Eddy Curry, Rodrigue Beaubois and Brandan Wright built a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter. And while he joked beforehand that “I hope they suck,” Cuban did not gloat too much, though his assessment of the Lakers did come with a smile on his face. “It will be interesting to see how they get it together,” Cuban said in the hallway outside the Mavericks locker room. “The Lakers are going to be a good team. I don’t think there’s anything to worry about. It’s going to take time, but what’s going to be interesting is to see how it plays out, how long it takes them to find their identity and see who they are. They’ve got amazing talent, they’re going to be a great team, but it doesn’t necessarily happen overnight.” The Lakers and Mavericks might serve as a referendum this season on how best to win by the rules of the new collective bargaining agreement, which were brought into relief Saturday when Oklahoma City dealt James Harden to Houston because it did not want to pay a steep luxury tax to keep him. The Lakers, who hope to sign Howard to a max contract extension next summer, are going all in by signing the 38-year-old Nash to a three-year deal, and teaming them with Bryant, Pau Gasol and World Peace. The Mavericks, after whiffing on Howard and Williams, pieced together a roster full of solid talent on one-year contracts, such as O.J. Mayo, Elton Brand and Chris Kaman (who was out injured) in the hopes of getting one more run out of Nowitzki, who will miss the first six to eight weeks of the season after undergoing knee surgery. Cuban, who has enjoyed tweaking the Lakers, said beforehand of their conglomeration of stars: “I don’t have a problem with it because until guys start playing until they’re 50, it always comes to an end at some point. Houston went for it when they got Barkley and it didn’t happen. Guys have shelf lives, they don’t play forever and so at some point, you have to reformulate your team. In the meantime, if someone has a 'super team,' that’s fine. We did all right when we got to the Finals against a super team (beating Miami two years ago) and when we were the super team in the Finals, we lost (to the Heat in 2006).” The Lakers hardly carried themselves with the air of a super team Tuesday. Their offense looked sharp at the start, but stagnated as the game progressed, leaving one to wonder if the Princeton offense were named for the giant Sycamores on campus. When the Lakers came out of a timeout with 8:50 left, all five starters stood near the scorer’s table with Nash directing an animated conversation with Bryant and Gasol. Howard and World Peace listened. Only Gasol, with his supreme skill set, looked truly at ease in the offense, leading the Lakers across the board with 23 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. “We’re running, by NBA standards, a fairly untraditional set so it’s going to take us a lot of time,” Nash said. “It is complex and it takes cohesion from each guy that we just don’t have yet. We have to figure out ways to win in the meantime.” That would require playing some defense. As Brown noted, the Lakers’ initial effort was adequate, but the second effort was non-existent. If Howard was supposed to solve the pick-and-roll troubles of Andrew Bynum, the Mavericks instead used Gasol’s man to set the picks. Brown called the defense a disappointment, but others called it worse. “Those are things that are unacceptable,” Antawn Jamison, the newly acquired forward, said of the Lakers’ poor communication. “I don’t know if we just felt that because Dirk wasn’t playing or what, that’s unacceptable with this group of guys. We know we have a lot of talent at both ends of the floor. You’ve seen it with Miami – just because you have a lot of talent doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed. You have to put in the work and have a certain type of chemistry. You have to have a certain chip on your shoulder.” That would be hard to imagine with the Lakers and their great expectations. But the start of the regular season showed there is work to be done if all this talent is to come together, if the Lakers are to put the title back in entitlement.",Raw Data
937,"﻿Benjamin Galindo entered his second stint with CD Guadalajara armed with a series of excuses to explain away a stuttering start to his tenure. The former Mexico midfielder assumed control from John van't Schip four days before Chivas hosted Toluca in its opening match of the Clausura. He had no time to build or form his own team. He opened the campaign without top scorer Rafael Márquez Lugo. And he operated under the auspices of a chaotic front office setup incapable of setting a stable direction for the club. All of those factors – plus a difficult fixture list to start the season and the usual dose of chaos for a club usually ravaged by discord – ensured the results met those rather low expectations. Two points from three matches still represents a poor return for a club with Chivas' resources. Sunday night's 1-1 draw with Cruz Azul offered little in the way of immediate encouragement. Márquez Lugo returned from his left knee complaint to score a wonderful goal shortly before halftime, but his acrobatic finish marked the high point in this stalemate against the nine-man side. Aside from a Marco Fabián opportunity somehow wasted shortly after the equalizer, Chivas looked unlikely to add to that haul. La Maquina enjoyed the better of the play and the better of the opportunities. Javier Orozco somehow conspired to miss from close range after neat work in the buildup early in the first half, but he atoned with a header a few minutes later to equalize. Mariano Pavone should have restored the lead at least once in the second half without somehow converting in front of goal. Nicolás Bertolo's harsh dismissal for a second bookable offense – procured when the referee interpreted a likely penalty award as a piece of simulation – underscored the notion that Cruz Azul might have collected all three points on another day. The reprieve permitted the home side to pick up a second consecutive home draw as Galindo attempts to sort out his side for the matches ahead. It isn't a brief beyond the capabilities of a seasoned squad capable of claiming a place in the Liguilla. Talent isn't a particular concern at Estadio Omnilife even if other sides may possess more of it. Miguel Sabah's imminent return from a two-match ban will finally allow him to revive his partnership with Marquez Lugo. Fabián could drop into a midfield ably marshaled by Jorge Enríquez and Luis Pérez. Veteran center back Héctor Reynoso provides the bedrock for a rearguard capable of improvement in front of Luis Michel. With the quality of the options available among the playing staff and the significant demands attached to managing one of the country's two largest clubs (particularly with the other giant currently sitting atop the table), Galindo won't enjoy an abundance of time to correct matters. The former Santos Laguna manager deserves some latitude for this opening period with Márquez Lugo injured and Sabah suspended, but he must now steer Chivas back on track in fairly short order despite playing three of the next four matches away from home. If Galindo fails to rectify matters quickly, then he must face increasing scrutiny without the luxury of pointing to external factors as one of the sources of his misfortune. Around Liga MX – Jornada 3 Club América, Club Tijuana and Tigres remained atop the table by extending their unblemished runs to three matches. América garnered most of the headlines with a 4-0 home thrashing of bottom side Atlante on Saturday. Tigres (1-0 win over Atlas on Saturday night courtesy of an Emanuel Villa goal seven minutes before halftime) and Tijuana (2-1 victory at Pumas on Sunday afternoon) took care of their own assignments to ensure all three sides ended the weekend on nine points. Surprise package Querétaro and perennial powers Toluca joined Cruz Azul in the chasing pack four points behind the leaders. Gallos Blancos left Atlas in the relegation place for the next few days by notching a 1-1 draw at 10-man Pachuca. Toluca registered its first victory of the Clausura when Lucas Silva struck at the near post after 77 minutes to secure a 2-1 victory at reeling Club León. Morelia sits on four points with five other sides in midtable after a 2-1 victory over San Luis. Puebla and Santos Laguna ended up in this gaggle after Luis Noriega nodded home William Paredes' free kick in second half stoppage time to lift Puebla to a 2-1 home victory.

Friday afternoon saw the Football Association charge Hazard over the incident, stating the standard sanction for violent conduct was ""clearly insufficient"" in the Belgian's case. Chelsea had today still to decide whether to contest that charge but it is understood that they would have to do so to stand any realistic hope of avoiding being handed an additional ban. Anything over three matches would trigger an automatic appeal by the European champions and Benitez said after today's 2-2 FA Cup fourth-round draw at Brentford: ""At the moment, we will accept that three games is enough. ""So we will see what happens."" Benitez claimed he was unaware whether the club would fight the charge, although it is understood they stand ready to use video evidence to show Hazard poked the ball from under Morgan in an attempt to retrieve it rather than simply kicking the 17-year-old during Wednesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg. ""I think that you have been watching the replay, different angles and everything,"" Benitez said. ""For a player that was in a cup competition, with this intensity and in the way that things are going on, I think that a three-game ban is enough.""

942,"A.J. Perez previously worked at USA Today, AOL and CBSSports.com covering beats ranging from performance-enhancing drugs to the NHL. AJ has also been a finalist for an Associated Press Sports Editors award for investigative reporting. Follow him on Twitter @ajperezfox. The San Jose Sharks captain took a dozen stitches after a teammate on his Swiss league team clipped him with a stick in practice. The wounds below his left eye may not be very noticeable when the NHL begins its lockout-shortened 48-game season next weekend. Thornton told FOXSports.com that the scar left by the league’s most recent work stoppage — which officially came to an end on Saturday — will fade almost as quickly. “We went through it before,” said Thornton at the team’s training facility. “That’s why I went overseas. I thought there might not be a season. It would have really been too bad if we lost this season. “We know everybody is upset with what went down. Our fans in San Jose are passionate. I expect them to be just as good they have been in the years I’ve been here.” Training camps open on Sunday, a day after the NHL players followed the owners in ratifying the new collective bargaining agreement. (A memorandum of understanding was signed Saturday night to officially end the lockout.) Players will undergo physicals and then quickly attempt to get NHL-ready in a week’s time. The season opens for most teams on Saturday with the rest following the next day. The prevailing feeling is that teams like the Sharks — a squad with little turnover from a season ago — have an edge due to the shortened camp and condensed schedule, which is short on off days and will see no games played between the two conferences until the Stanley Cup Final. “There’s a lot of continuity when it comes to systems and players,” Sharks general manager Doug Wilson said. “A year ago, we had about nine or 10 new players. I’m not sure that would have been conducive to a good start.” San Jose has made only two significant personnel moves: signing free agents defenseman Brad Stuart and center Adam Burish. “That question will be answered fairly quickly,” Sharks coach Todd McLellan said on the question if teams with stable rosters will have the edge. “I like the fact that we have some familiarity within the organization among our core players.” The biggest change for the Sharks — an organization that that has been longer on expectations than results the last few seasons — was in the coaching staff. The Sharks brought in Hall of Fame defenseman and former New Jersey Devils coach Larry Robinson and former NHL defenseman and Washington Capitals assistant coach Jim Johnson. “They are tapping into each other and challenging each other,” Wilson said. “It’s arguably the best staff we’ve ever had.” As the lockout dragged on, there were times it looked like McLellan and his staff wouldn’t get a chance at improving a team that was bounced in the first round last season. The Los Angeles Kings, a division rival that finished behind the Sharks in the standings, went on to win their first Stanley Cup. “It came down to the wire,” Sharks forward Ryane Clowe said of the threat of another dark season. “I was a little nervous.” Ten Sharks players skated in Europe, although to varying degrees. Thornton played the most games (30) and others played only a handful. Defenseman Dan Boyle organized a regular skate in San Jose for players who didn’t head overseas. McLellan has been able to see and interact some with the players as they returned over the last several days, although he won’t be allowed to coach them until Sunday. So far, he said the players looked like they kept themselves hockey-ready. “The players knew from Day 1 that they were the only ones responsible for their health when they got back here,” McLellan said. “The last time we saw them, everybody was healthy, everybody was fit. I expect when we get everybody in camp, we’ll be good.” Durability and fitness will be factors for all 30 teams. The Sharks, for example, play seven sets of back-to-back games. Maybe brutal at times, there is an upside. “I think you are going to see some intense hockey,” Clowe said. “You are going to have coaches stressing everybody out by emphasizing how important a good start is. I know guys are going to take a while to get their legs back. But after a few games, I think the pace will be high.”",Raw Data

Guard Rodney Stuckey, who's totaled 22 points in his last three games, has scored 18.3 per contest in his past three against the Celtics. The Pistons have also been very inconsistent recently, dropping three of four since a 6-1 stretch that followed a six-game losing streak. They'll be looking to avoid their third straight home defeat while trying to shake off a 102-87 rout by New York in London on Thursday. ""We came here to play a competition ... on an international stage, which is a privilege and an honor to be selected, so it's disappointing that we came up short and didn't play our best,"" coach Lawrence Frank said. Detroit will try to regain its shooting touch, having made 32.3 percent from 3-point range and 61.1 percent from the free-throw line in the past five games. That may not be easy to do against Boston, which has limited opponents to 26.1 percent from beyond the arc in its latest five contests. Rajon Rondo will look to carry over the momentum from a season-high 30-point performance against the Bulls. The point guard had a career-high 35 points in a 98-88 loss to the Pistons on Feb. 15, but he's totaled 17 points in the last two meetings and had six turnovers both times despite also recording 10 assists in those two games. Boston needs stars Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to get their shooting back on track. Pierce has made 32.7 from the floor in the last three games, while Garnett has shot 31.3 or below in two of those three contests. The Celtics have averaged 88.7 points in that stretch. They've scored 84.0 per contest during their three-game skid versus the Pistons. Boston guard Avery Bradley is doubtful to play Sunday after missing Friday's game because of a rib injury.",Raw Data
946,"ST. LOUIS - A stranger approached Stan Musial's grandson Andrew Edmonds during the Hall of Famer's public viewing Thursday, with tears running down his face. ""Your grandpa's best attribute,"" the man said, ""was that he made nobodies feel like somebodies."" The thought was shared by many Saturday as friends, family, former teammates and many who never even met him gathered at the Cathedral Basilica for a funeral Mass to remember the life of the one known simply as, 'The Man'. Musial, who died Jan. 19 at the age of 92, spent his entire 22-year career with the Cardinals and maintained his residence in St. Louis following his playing days. Among those in attendance Saturday were the Cardinals six living Hall of Famers Ozzie Smith, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson, Whitey Herzog, Bruce Sutter and Musial's former roommate Red Schoendienst and five former and current Cardinals managers. Many others spoke before, during and after the service of what Musial meant to them, the game of baseball and to the city of St. Louis. Broadcaster Bob Costas provided a heartwarming and emotional eulogy, recalling how Paul Simon wrote a song in the 1960s asking, 'Where did you go Joe DiMaggio?' ""No one in St. Louis ever had to wonder where Stan Musial had gone,"" Costas told the crowd. ""He was right here, right here at home. Our greatest ballplayer sure, but also our friend, our neighbor and that is why the bond and attachment between this player and this city is unique and lasting."" Musial is the Cardinals' franchise all-time leader in games played, at-bats, runs scored, hits, total bases, doubles, triples, home runs, RBI, walks and extra-base hits. At the time of his retirement in 1963, he held or shared 17 major league records. He hit .331 and had 475 home runs and 1,951 RBI during his career and led the league in doubles eight times. He finished his career with 3,630 hits - exactly 1,815 at home and 1,815 on the road. For many in attendance Saturday, his statistics were meaningless. ""To me it wasn't the numbers, it was the man he was,"" former Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols said. ""That to me was the most important thing, what he did off the field and always with a big smile. You never saw him not smiling. Every memory to me was great. I was blessed to have him and blessed to know him over the last 11 years. Obviously he blessed my life many, many times. ""To live for 92 years, what a great life. I think Cardinal nation and St. Louis, we should be proud and blessed to have had him for that long."" Musial is also celebrated for skipping the 1945 season to serve in the Navy in World War II. When he returned a year later, Musial won his second MVP award and led the Cardinals to the 1946 World Series title. Bishop Richard Stika told a story of how Musial used to push his wife Lil's wheelchair out to their car each Sunday following Mass and how children would follow along and offer their assistance. When Musial would open the trunk to put away the wheelchair, he'd pull out autographed items to give to the kids. Musial was a father to four, a grandfather to 11 and a great grandfather to 12. He was a friend to several hundred and a hero and icon to thousands of others. Fittingly a crowd of Cardinals fans that were gathered outside the Cathedral were let into the service when a patch of empty seats were discovered off to the side. His son-in-law Martin Schwarze recalled a time when Musial accompanied him on a trip to Australia. While shopping in a mall, a man turned to Schwarze and said, ""Don't look now, but I think that's Stan the Man."" Schwarze smiled and brought Musial over to meet him. Schwarze also told the story of a time in recent years when Musial was asked how he would do if he played baseball today with the evolution of closers and tough relief pitchers. When Musial responded that he would hit .275, the interviewer reminded him that he had a lifetime .331 batting average. ""Yea, but I'm 75 years old,"" Musial said. Said Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr., ""He was a friend to Presidents and Popes but never missed an opportunity to make a young child or fan happy with an autograph or picture. He made it a point to reach out to rookies and role players to let them know they mattered and were important to the team."" Among the other notables to attend the funeral were baseball commissioner Bud Selig, former Cardinals and current Cincinnati Reds general manager Walt Jocketty and current Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak. Former Cardinals player and manager Joe Torre was in attendance, as was former Cardinals manager Tony La Russa and current manager Mike Matheny. Closer Jason Motte was among a group of current players to attend while Jack Clark, Jim Edmonds and several former Cardinals players took part as well. ""There's no question he's a landmark here and from the first time you met him you knew he was something special,"" Torre said. ""He's everything you hoped he would be and more, to have a superstar not act like one and to be a friend to everyone who shook his hand. ""The one that always puts a smile on my face was his jokes. They were the worst but the way he told them, he would start laughing before he told the punch line and everybody would laugh with him. He was just so comfortable in his skin and he made everybody feel comfortable around him. He was a great humanitarian, he really cared for people and they obviously embraced him here."" Said Selig, ""It really was a celebration of a great life. He really was a great player and everybody knows that, all the statistics, but a remarkable human being in every way. It was an honor to be here today. ""It was remarkable. He was a great man and we're lucky in baseball to have a man as great as this off the field, be one of our great super stars of all-time. You could see and hear that today."" The funeral procession traveled to Busch Stadium following the Mass, where they stopped in front of Musial's statue for a prayer ceremony. As a single Clydesdale stood guard, the Musial family took turns laying single roses at the base of the statue. Hundreds of Cardinals fans began singing ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" as the family waved and joined in. The crowd then erupted into loud cheers and applause, a touching moment for anyone in attendance. A fan held up a sign that read, ""A love story. Stan, Lil and Cardinal Nation."" Musial and his wife Lil were married nearly 72 years before she died last May. Bishop Stika told the story of the time Pope John Paul II visited St. Louis and Musial and his wife came to see him after previously meeting him in Poland. When Musial got out of his car, the crowd waiting to see the Pope cheered and went crazy for him. ""It was obvious of that special connection that existed between Stan the Man and the people of St. Louis,"" Bishop Stika said. It even more obvious Saturday afternoon.",Raw Data
947,"When Arsenal take on Bayern Munich on Tuesday night they will be greeted by a strange sight – Manuel Neuer wearing a four-fingered glove (or three fingered with a thumb if you want to be pedantic). The Germany international goalkeeper had the glove – on his right hand only – especially designed by Adidas after bruising his hand in training. Rather than sitting out any matches, the new glove connects his index and middle finger together in one place, thus limiting pain and stabilising the sensitive area sufficiently enough to allow him continue to play. Neuer tested the glove out for the first time this weekend and he seemed to be alert as ever as he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg. The 26-year-old has established himself as arguably the best goalkeeper in the world and is in simply sensational form for Bayern this season. The German giants have yet to concede a goal in 2013 and have only let in seven goals all season in the Bundesliga. Arsenal will be hoping home advantage will give them the edge in the first leg at the Emirates but amazingly Neuer has conceded just one goal away from home in the Bundesliga this season in 11 matches. Finger missing or not, Arsenal will have their work cut out beating the former Schalke man on Tuesday night.",Raw Data
948,"So when he stood on a podium bearing the league shield on Wednesday and announced that the owners unanimously approved the labor deal reached over the weekend with the players' association, he also took the time to mend badly damaged fences. ''To the players who were very clear they wanted to be on the ice and not negotiating labor contracts, to our partners who support the league financially and personally, and most importantly to our fans, who love and have missed NHL hockey, I am sorry,'' Bettman said. The league's board of governors met in a Manhattan hotel Wednesday and overwhelmingly approved the agreement that was hammered out early Sunday on the 113th day of the lockout. Bettman was well aware of all the negative talk during the four-month dispute that kept hockey off the ice and was contrite in announcing the latest step by the owners. He said he wants to look forward and not back at the mess created by the work stoppage. ''We know that no words of apology or explanation will soften the disappointment,'' Bettman said. ''I read the letters, I followed the tweets, I read the blogs. We have a lot of work to do. ''As commissioner of the National Hockey League it sometimes falls upon me to make tough decisions that disappoint and occasionally anger players and fans. This was a long and extremely difficult negotiation - one that took a lot longer than anybody wanted. I know it caused frustration, disappointment and even suffering to a lot of people who have supported the National Hockey League in many different ways.'' In his nearly 20 years as commissioner, Bettman has presided over three lockouts. One caused the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, another led to a 48-game season in 1995 - much like is expected for this season. The latest lockout forced the cancellation of 510 games. Overall, 2,208 games have been lost by labor disputes during his tenure. But Bettman was quick to call any speculation he might consider stepping down from his post as ''unfounded.'' ''I am looking forward to continuing to grow this game, both on and off the ice, as we have over the last 20 years,'' he said. ''I think the opportunities are great, and I am excited to be a part of them.'' Players are expected to vote on the deal Friday and Saturday. If a majority of the more than 700 members in good standing agree to the terms, training camps can open Sunday. A 48-game season is likely to begin Jan. 19. The NHL and the union are still drafting a memorandum of understanding that must be signed before training camps open. The players' association wants as much of the document as possible to be completed before voting begins. The union is busy calling players and agents to educate them about the changes and additions to the agreement. The vote will be done electronically. There will be no more than seven days between the opening of camps and the start of the season, and no preseason games will be played. Teams will be challenged to be ready right from the start. ''It's one thing to skate and check out their conditioning and everything else, but you don't get a chance to experiment much with lineups and lines and combinations,'' Washington Capitals general manager George McPhee said. ''That's the hardest thing for managers right now. A lot of unknowns ... but we're excited nonetheless to get going.'' Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman, who forged a Hall of Fame playing career over 22 seasons with the Detroit Red Wings, isn't concerned about getting adjusted to the new deal because the key issue of the salary cap isn't all that different. ''As things go along, every change you make, every rule you put in whether it's on ice or off ice, generally has unforeseen consequences that come up with it,'' said Yzerman, who retired one season after the 2004-05 lockout. ''I don't see it being terribly difficult. ''Over the next year or two the market will readjust and that will sort itself out.'' The agreement is for 10 years, but either side can opt out after eight. The previous deal was in effect for seven seasons. ''It's one that will stand the test of time with a system where all teams can be competitive and have a chance to make the playoffs and even win the Stanley Cup,'' Bettman said. ''It guarantees that our attention from now on will stay where it belongs, on the ice.'' After the players vote to ratify, clubs can begin the process of winning back fans. Bettman declined to give specifics because he didn't want to be presumptuous that the union would give its approval. ''The National Hockey League has the responsibility to earn back your trust and support, whether you watch one game or every game,'' Bettman said. ''That effort begins today. The players are ready to play their hearts out for you, the teams are preparing to welcome you back with open arms, the wait is just about over. ''Like all of you, we can't wait to drop the puck.'' The NHL won't release the new schedule until players ratify the deal. The regular season was supposed to begin Oct. 11, but the lockout wrecked those plans after it took effect Sept. 16. The outdoor Winter Classic and the All-Star game won't be played this season. Last season, the NHL generated $3.3 billion of revenue, and the new deal will lower the players' percentage from 57 to 50. Players will receive $300 million in transition payments over three years to account for existing contracts, pushing their revenue share over 50 percent at the start of the deal. They also gained a defined benefit pension plan for the first time. The salary cap for this season will be $70.2 million before prorating to adjust for the shortened season, and the cap will drop to $64.3 million in 2013-14 - the same amount as 2011-12. There will be a salary floor of $44 million in those years. Free agents will be limited to contracts of seven years (eight for those re-signed with their former club). Salaries within a contract may not vary by more than 35 percent year to year, and the lowest year must be at least 50 percent of the highest year. The minimum salary will remain at $525,000, and there were no changes to eligibility for free agency and salary arbitration. The threshold for teams to release players in salary arbitration will increase from $1.75 million to $3 million. Each team may use two buyouts to terminate contracts before the 2013-14 or 2014-15 seasons for two-thirds of the remaining guaranteed income. The buyout will be included in the players' revenue share but not the salary cap. Revenue sharing will increase to $200 million annually and rise with revenue. An industry growth fund of $60 million will be funded by the sides over three years and be replenished as needed. Issues such as whether NHL players will participate in the 2014 Olympics and realignment within the league will be addressed with the union down the line. ''Together our collective future is extremely bright,'' said Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs, who is also the chairman of the board of governors. ''Our only interest now is to look ahead and focus on what this great game can provide to the best sports fans in the world.''",Raw Data

I am excited to coach and lead this talented roster of players on the Suns quest for a WNBA championship. Donovan brings an impressive resume to Connecticut. A member of the 1995 Naismith Hall of Fame class, she won Olympic gold medals as both a player (1984 and 88) and coach (2008).

She helped the Monarchs win the 1980 AIAW National Championship, and graduated with the ODU career records for points (2,710) and rebounds (1976). Her 801 blocked shots are still an NCAA record. This is an extremely exciting day for the Connecticut Sun, team CEO Mitchell Etess said. Anne is someone who has achieved remarkable success as both a player and coach, and there is no doubt she is the right person to guide us as we begin our 11th season in the WNBA.""",Raw Data

951,"AJ Allmendinger is thrilled to be back in a race car. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. For the first time in six seasons, there was no preseason testing at Daytona International Speedway in a stock car. There have been no trips to shop to get his seat fitted in the new Generation 6 car. Heck, Dinger even missed participating in this weeks annual Charlotte Motor Speedway media tour. You laugh and think, Yeah, the media tour is annoying, Allmendinger said. But gosh, Id still like to be there. Allmendinger still is paying the price for the foolish mistake he made last June that resulted in NASCAR suspending him for testing positive for Adderall. Yes, the 30-year-old racer successfully completed the road to recovery, but that doesnt mean his path back to racing has been easy. After signing a lucrative contract with Penske Racing before the 2012 Sprint Cup season and winning the Rolex 24 Hours one year ago, Allmendingers career was coming together. Still, he struggled with his new Cup team and a rookie crew chief who had never called a 500-mile race. While qualifying was respectable he started on the front row three times in the first 10 races adjusting the car throughout the course of the event was a challenge for the crew. Pressure mounted throughout the season as the No. 22 Dodge failed to provide the anticipated results early on. Despite putting on a remarkable show in the Sprint All-Star qualifier in May where Dinger won the pole but suffered a flat tire and drove from last to finish second to Dale Earnhardt Jr. six weeks later his world came crashing down. Once I got over the whole thing with the suspension and being fired, it became about figuring out what I was going to do next, Allmendinger said. Although Allmendinger received clearance to race from NASCAR on Sept. 19, he remained sidelined from competition for more than three weeks before James Finch offered him a ride for the race at Charlotte. Allmendinger raced in four of the final six events of the season for Finch. With the support hes received from family and friends in the motorsports community including team owners Roger Penske, Michael Shank and Finch Allmendinger is steadily forging a comeback. From his earliest days in go-karts 25 years ago, racing is all hes ever known. Every day is an up and down day, but its nice to be at a racetrack, for sure; that makes it a lot easier, Allmendinger said. To be back with guys that have been so close to me especially Mike. I look at him like Roger, but obviously hes more like a brother or a best friend to me and its been like that the last few years. Id do anything for that guy and he would do anything for me. To be back with him and all these guys that Ive seen, honestly, for like the last seven years on this race team. He takes such good care of his guys it just makes you feel good. WHAT A DAY! Brad Keselowski won the title but how did the rest of the Chase field end up? NASCAR Standings Allmendinger hopes to reward Shank and the Michael Shank Racing team with a repeat win in this weekends Rolex 24. Last year, Allmendinger closed the 24-hour event by driving the No. 60 Ford to victory lane, but that seems like a lifetime ago. Sure, there are times at home that I wake up and it feels like Groundhog Day every day, Allmendinger said. You go to the gym for a couple of hours and youre like, All right. Hit some golf balls, Sweet. OK, and then its like one oclock and Im done and its like, Well, Im done, what do I do? Thats been tough during the winter. Ive been so used to being at a race shop or getting ready to go. January comes and your life is usually chaos and now its not. But the phone is still ringing, so thats a good thing and Im just trying to piece it together. Perhaps Allmendingers biggest surprise throughout this ordeal is the encouragement hes received from Penske. Whether its the weekly phone calls or the testimonials the Captain has offered to provide on Allmendingers behalf, the driver has learned tremendous lessons in character. On Wednesday, Penske acknowledged that Allmendingers release following the positive drug test was a decision I had to make professionally, not one I wanted to make maybe personally, but one I had to make. Penske insisted that he feels responsible to try to help him get back on his feet, because I think hes got a lot of talent, and I think he was just coming of age with us. I told James [Finch] that Id be glad to talk to a sponsor, because certainly there was nothing that he did on the track or off the track, other than the one situation, that would make me feel any different, Penske added. As an aspiring racer, Allmendinger grew up worshipping Penske and his accomplishments in motorsports. He acknowledged that the greatest disappointment in his career was letting Roger down. Still, Penskes ability to lead by example had a significant effect on Allmendinger. Its one of the things you read and hear from everybody else what a stand-up guy he is, Allmendinger said. That saying, Once youre in the family, youre in the family. But until it happens to you lets be honest he didnt have to keep talking to me. There really was no reason for him to. ""Just through the process and after the process to call me and make sure that Im good and all the quotes you read, like from James [Finch] that if theyre close to a sponsor hell try to close the deal all of that it makes me feel good. Its more than I ever expected or ever imagined or felt like I deserved. Hes just an amazing guy. FAST WOMEN Meet the lovely ladies who get the NASCAR stars revved up. Im so happy that he could finally win the Cup championship. Obviously hes done so much in IndyCar. Everything you could do in IndyCar times 10, but to finally get that Cup championship because that whole organization has worked so hard. ""It was kind of bittersweet because I wish I could have been there to share it, but to be able to watch it on TV was so amazing. It makes me feel good that he does all that, hes got all of his drivers and he still cares about me. It means more to me than any job that Ive had in my life. Allmendinger and his MSR teammates will start sixth on Saturday in the DP class. The team still is searching for speed to compete against the two Ganassi Racing BMWs, which are nearly a second and a half faster than their Fords. While sandbagging is commonplace in qualifying, Allmendinger hopes that Ganassi is showing all of their hand. No one is as good as they are right now, Allmendinger said. But nobody really shows their hand until the race. Thats kind of what we did last year, so youre not really sure. Yesterday, I was really disappointed because I couldnt get any more speed out of the car. Whether I led us in the wrong direction, we just didnt feel like we hit it yesterday. But at night, the 6 car had good speed and we kind of learned from them. [MSR teammates] Justin [Wilson], Oz [Negri] and the guys got in there and made it better. This morning, just in the couple of laps, I felt the car was better. So I think well be good for the race competitively. Where well stack up against Ganassi and everybody else, Im just not sure. Its tough to go out and defend it especially how Ganassi has stepped up their game. But if you can be there with a couple of hours to go, youve got a chance. As for opportunities after the Rolex 24, Allmendinger is keeping his options open. For now, driving the No. 51 Phoenix Racing Chevrolet at Phoenix International Raceway on March 3 is tentatively next on his schedule and possibly three of the next four Cup races to follow. Allmendinger isnt sure whether hell have any seat time in the new cars before the race. If not, hell just figure it out once the team gets to the track. At this stage in his career, Allmendinger cant afford to be demanding. Hes learned to be grateful for the breaks hes afforded. Its a tough situation because both of us want to do it, Allmendinger said. If we could do it full-time we would. I really enjoy those guys, and I think their stuff is going to be pretty good. Obviously, they got behind last year with everything that happened, but they have a couple of new cars and Im looking forward to it. I havent driven the new car yet, but talking to Marcos [Ambrose] and everybody, it seems like they like it. It seems fast. Ill be excited once we get to that point and be able to do that. I look at this season it could be a tough year or it could be one of the best years of my life. I could drive a lot of different race cars throughout the year and have a good time doing that. Im doing everything that I can throughout a daily process just to know whatever ride that I get in, whatever opportunity I have, Im ready to go and have given it everything that I have.",Raw Data

Follow him on Twitter or like him on Facebook. Portland Trail Blazers general manager Neil Olshey stepped onto the court with Damian Lillard before Thursday night’s tip-off and the crowd, a crowd that hasn’t had much to celebrate the last few years, let itself be heard. The moment was meant to present the point guard with Western Conference Rookie of the Month honors, but the meaning behind the quick, intense burst of applause was as much about the future as it was about November. During a 16-game stretch to open the season, which announced his arrival in a league already bursting with dominant point guards, Lillard averaged 18.4 points, 5.9 assists and 1.38 steals per game. And now, with their latest potential savior being honored before playing the Denver Nuggets, the crowd grew surprisingly intense. Lillard, a highly touted question mark when he was taken with the No. 6 pick in the 2012 NBA draft, has turned his short NBA career into a burst of positivity for a franchise largely defined by serious busts, bad knees and terrible choices. At least so far, the best rookie in the league is a sign that maybe, just maybe, all that hollow hope could be behind the Trail Blazers and their fans. Through 24 games, including Thursday’s night’s 101-93 win over the Denver Nuggets, Lillard has been the best rookie in the league. He’s averaging 18.5 points and 6.5 assists per game. His youthful poise and leadership is a big reason this team is hovering around. 500 despite a very bad defense, woeful bench play and the distinction of having the fewest assists in the league. Lillard’s playmaking ability for his teammates is, needless to say, sorely needed. Even on off nights like Thursday, when he shot just 3 of 14, he still led an offense without injured LaMarcus Aldridge that found a way to beat a tenacious Denver team. Lillard finished with 12 points and 10 assists for his third double-double of the season. The Weber State product had two plays down the stretch — a huge 3 and a monster dunk – that willed his team to the win. It didn’t hurt that Denver went 0 for 22 from the 3-point line. Yes, 0 for 22. Thanks largely to Lillard’s excellence, the Trail Blazers are 12-12 on the season. That record’s not a revelation, exactly, but it’s a solid mark given the thin state of this team’s roster and the distance it still has to go to compete in the grueling Western Conference. Fact is, this is a point-guard led league, and it seems Portland now has a gem of one. Along with Aldridge and small forward Nic Batum, Lillard is part of an encouraging nucleus around which to build. Lillard’s speed, shooting ability, natural feel for the pick-and-roll and an advanced feel for the game and for winning have turned this lottery selection into a boon. That’s obviously excellent news for the Blazers and their fans. But the real luck may not be that Lillard has worked out so marvelously. The real luck might be that the man who selected him is here at all. Portland's good fortune could be that the Los Angeles Clippers' toxic culture forced the architect of that team’s good fortune to bolt for Portland. In June, after his smart moves and canny instincts helped turn the laughingstock of the NBA into one of its best and deepest teams, Olshey resigned. You don’t step away from a team that has Blake Griffin locked up for five years and Chris Paul likely to sign a similar long-term deal. You don’t leave a market such as Los Angeles, where stars will flock, for a place like Portland, where they won’t. You don’t turn your back on a championship-caliber team you put together to start over for a two-year-or-longer rebuilding project. Unless a place is so poorly run, with a culture so difficult to function in and an owner so unpleasant to work for that it drives away successful people. But the Clippers' amateurism may very well be the Trail Blazers' good, and lasting, luck. The selection of Brandon Roy in 2006? Pretty good, considering he won Rookie of the Year. At least until a knee injury destroyed his career and Portland’s well-laid plans. Ditto having the No. 1 overall pick the following year, and passing on Kevin Durant to take sure-thing Greg Oden. Made all the sense in the world, until Oden’s knee injuries wrecked his career, too. This is an organization plagued by false saviors, one in which even its successes come with doses of what-could-have-been. Sam Bowie as the No. 2 pick in 1984 instead of Michael Jordan speaks for itself. Bill Walton as the No. 1 pick in 1975 helped them win a title in 1977, but his own injuries negated much of what had been expected from him and that team. Perhaps Lillard — and Olshey — can be the start of more winning, the way the Blazers did in the early 1990s when Clyde Drexler helped take them to two NBA Finals. Olshey’s tenure with the Clippers was short and had its own share of good luck. He was an assistant GM when they took Griffin as the no-brainer first pick in 2009. But he orchestrated the Paul trade last December without draining the franchise of all its complementary pieces (unlike, say, the New York Knicks), allowing him to hold onto Eric Bledsoe, now the best backup point guard in the league. Then Olshey built around that core group by getting Chauncey Billups and Caron Butler and wisely matching Golden State’s offer sheet for DeAndre Jordan. That’s good work. You could argue everyone but Portland lost out when Olshey left the Clippers, Olshey included. There will be no top-five stars hoping to force their way to Portland, and if this team is ever bad enough to land another No. 1-overall, franchise-saving pick like Griffin, Olshey is unlikely to still be here to make the selection. No, this effort will be much, much harder. But if Lillard is any indication — and the guts it took to use that pick, acquired from Brooklyn last year for Gerald Wallace, on a player who did not face top-tier talent while at Weber State — then Portland got their man. Check that. They got their men. You can follow Bill Reiter on Twitter or email him at foxsportsreiter@gmail.com.",Raw Data
953,"City manager Roberto Mancini has consistently said his fellow Italian is not for sale throughout this month's transfer window but that has not quashed rumors linking him with the San Siro giants. Milan have made their liking for the 22-year-old clear but have previously baulked at City's reported £28million valuation. Now fresh reports have emerged claiming negotiations between the clubs have begun but City's public message on the matter has not changed. First-team coach David Platt said: ""I saw that speculation (on Sunday) but I've not heard anything. ""As far as we are concerned I think he is still a Manchester City player. I don't think there is anything is going to happen."" Platt was speaking on Mancini's behalf at a press conference to preview City's Barclays Premier League trip to QPR on Tuesday night. Mancini was equally forthright on the Balotelli subject when asked when he last met the press last week. Mancini said: ""No, it is not true, Mario stays here. We didn't have any requests about Mario or other players."" Balotelli has been involved in a number of high-profile controversies on and off the field during his time at City, including a training-ground bust-up with Mancini this month. But Mancini said he remains part of his long-term plans. He said: ""Yes, Mario has another three years on his contract."" Platt claims that situation has not changed. ""I can only go off what you know and I have seen. I know exactly the same as you, which is speculation. It's a shame Robbie's not here. He might know more than me."" In terms of fitness, Balotelli missed Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round tie at Stoke after illness but he is in contention for the game at Loftus Road. Captain Vincent Kompany will be missing after straining his calf at the Britannia Stadium and the Belgian will also be doubtful for Sunday's clash with Liverpool. Platt said: ""It could be a fortnight, it could be three weeks. My experience of calf strains would be no chance for Tuesday, Liverpool a big doubt with an outside chance, but that would depend on the gravity of it. ""In all honesty you're probably looking at the game after that being a potential realistic target."" Kompany's absence increases City's defensive problems with Kolo Toure on international duty and Matija Nastasic also doubtful with a minor knee injury. When asked if Nastasic was available, Platt said: ""Maybe, but he will have to train (on Monday).""",Raw Data
954,"Mater Dei School in Bethesda, Maryland can thank a first grader for school being cancelled on the Monday after Super Bowl XLVII. How did he make this possible? He simply made a free throw. The Headmaster of the school gave a seventh grader and an eighth grader the chance to make a three-pointer, before allowing the first grader to attempt a free throw. First grader, Blake Harper is now a legend for Mater Dei School. I dont know how the youngster managed to make it considering he was under the pressure of his whole school, but the entire gym went wild. This was actually a very impressive shot for a first grader; it literally went right into the hoop, no bank or rim necessary. Itd be quite the story if this kid ended up playing in college or the NBA one day. At least he can say that he got his TV debut early in life. Im kind of surprised that the Headmaster of the school came up with this idea. Mater Dei is a private, Catholic school for boys, grades 1 through 8. I guess football took priority over religion and education for the day. Either way, Im sure the boys enjoyed their day off of school on Super Bowl Monday. Even the staff jumped up in joy to celebrate the free throw. Then again, who wouldnt jump up for joy when a 6-7 year old makes a free throw and theres a prize? I think the only people that could be disappointed would be the parents that had to find a babysitter for the young ones in the school. Lets just hope this little boy was okay considering he was dog piled after making the shot.

955,"A soggy Tiger Woods, stepping in from the cold and rain after an excellent second-round 65 at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines, knew where I was going with the question. With his eyes, it seemed he might’ve agreed; with his words, well, he wasn’t going there. He’s gone 37 years without baring his soul, why start now? “Sometimes yes, sometimes no,” Woods said. “I’ve had it both ways.” What about now? “Well, I feel good right now,” he said, “I’m leading the tournament.” And that he was, by two shots ahead of Billy Horschel. But there would be no mention of champion skier Lindsey Vonn — with whom Woods has been romantically linked — or anything, as is his wont, much beyond birdies and bogeys. But there is something different about Tiger Woods this week. His demeanor is different; I last saw him this sure of himself at the Memorial, which was not only his best win but his best performance of 2012. Just maybe he’s found some peace, which has rarely been true since his life imploded in late 2009. While others have focused on his rebuilt swing, or injuries to his leg, there are those who’ve always felt that the greatest injury Woods received from crashing that Escalade into a fire hydrant was the one to his psyche. David Feherty, the television analyst who’s close to Woods, has long maintained that the biggest problem for Woods has been that “his head’s full of slamming doors.” In 2010, Tom Watson noted that great golf is played in silence. “(Woods) doesn’t hear that absolute silence when he’s playing,” he said. Woods, of course, doesn’t go down those roads; certainly not when the cameras and tape recorders are rolling. When asked where his confidence this week came from, he immediately moved to safer ground, talking of “reps.” “I think the practice sessions more than anything,” he said. “I’ve had beautiful practice sessions at home. If I can do it there, I can do it here. “Even though last week I only played two days (missing the cut in Abu Dhabi), I felt like I hit the ball well enough to shoot a better score than I did. I had a couple days at home to work on it, and I came out here and feel pretty good about it.” Last year, Woods’ constant refrain was that he couldn’t always translate good ball-striking on the range, or in practice rounds, to tournaments. What’s different now? “I’ve had another year in the system of working with Sean (Foley),” Woods said. “It’s not like something that you can do overnight and make changes and all of a sudden it’s great. “From where I came, to where I’m at now, it’s a big change.” For two days in on his beloved Torrey Pines — the course he and late father, Earl, played together many times and on which he’s won seven tournaments — Woods has, in a sense, gone back from whence he came. He’s been vintage Woods; rolling in putts, holing bunker shots, chipping well and rediscovering the player who was either first or second in par-5 birdie average from 2000 to '09, which was the cornerstone of his dominance. After three lean years in which Woods slipped to an average of 25th in par-5 scoring, he’s ruled them this week. He’s played eight par 5s in 9-under par and is 11 under for the tournament. “I played well today, drove the ball great and took advantage of the par 5s,” Woods said. “That’s basically where the round could be had. On the (shorter) North course, drive the ball well and you’re going to probably have 4-irons into the par 5s. “Sprinkle in with probably four or five wedge shots (into par 4ss) in there, a round of 6- or 7-under par is definitely conceivable.” Woods wasn’t just straight off the tee — he hit 12 of 14 fairways — but long. He averaged 320.5 yards off the tee in the wet, soft conditions, leading the field. But now comes time for the heavy lifting. Even though he won three times last year, he also folded on weekends, especially at the last three majors. It’s worth noting that after converting 30 of 32 second-round leads from 1999 until he got Yang’ed at the ’09 PGA, Woods is only 2 of 6 since. It will help that among his nearest pursuers, there’s no proven winner; indeed, the eight closest to Woods’s lead have a combined zero wins on the PGA Tour. But, in the end, whether he wins or not will probably have less to do with them, and everything to do with him.",Raw Data
956,"December 21, 2012 -- Most folks spend the Holiday Season with family and friends celebrating at their homes, hosting dinners and parties with relatives and loved ones. Many WNBA players and coaches, however, are competing abroad in various international basketball leagues during the WNBA offseason, often resulting in some creative play-calling with regards to celebrating over the holidays. Below are the plans of some of your favorite WNBA personalities for the 2012-13 Holiday season. SWIN CASH, CHICAGO SKY The last three years I spent Christmas over in China, where I was playing during the WNBA offseason. Christmas is a different beast over there. I actually played on Christmas Day, and one year I linked up with [current Seattle Storm forward] Camille Little for Christmas Eve in Shanghai. It was really special. That's the thing about being abroad, there are plusses and minuses. Maybe not being home with your family on Christmas is not ideal, but then again, how many people have the opportunity to be in a great city like Shanghai over the holidays? It's all about experiences. This year I'll be home in Atlanta and for the first time I'll be putting up the Christmas tree and cooking dinner. All those years playing ball during Christmas and it will be a nice change of pace this year to be home for the holidays with the people who are closest to me. ANGEL McCOUGHTRY, ATLANTA DREAM ""Usually, I try to head back home during the holidays, but here in Turkey, they don't really celebrate Christmas, so we have games during Christmas time,"" said McCoughtry, who along with teammate and fellow WNBA superstar Cappie Pondexter will be leading their Turkish club Fenerbahce, based in the historic city of Istanbul against Edremit on Dec. 23 and will then take on rival Istanbul club Galatasary the day after Christmas on Dec. 26. ""So it's a case sometimes of not spending your holiday with your family. I think we're going to try and get my Dad to come out this year so we can spend time over the holidays. And of course, we're going to have New Year's celebrations too. Istanbul is a wonderful city, with tremendous nightlife, it's really great, so we'll be sure to have a good time over the holidays. LIN DUNN, HEAD COACH 2012 WNBA CHAMPION INDIANA FEVER I'll be back home down in Tennessee for the holidays, said Dunn, who recently served up some southern fried wisdom when cooking for a holiday dinner for charity. If you're kin to me or know our family come on over and we can celebrate Christmas and the 2012 WNBA Championship of the Indiana Fever. LINDSAY WHALEN, MINNESOTA LYNX The thing I miss the most about Minnesota is my family, said All-WNBA point guard Lindsay Whalen via LynxBasketball.com from Turkey, where she plays for Galatasary, the aforementioned Istanbul-based club which challenges Fenerbahce for city supremacy. Its a time for everyone to be around family so that always is a little tough this time of year. That is one of the downfalls of what we do playing overseas. But we make the best of it through lots of phone calls and emails to stay in touch with our families. KRYSTAL THOMAS, PHOENIX MERCURY Were in the middle of the holiday season, Christmas is days away, and the New Year is right around the corner, blogged the WNBAs fifth leading rebounder from China, where she plays for Jiangsu Phoenix. Christmas is my absolute favorite holiday. From giving and opening gifts, spending time with family, and making family traditions it is just a special time of year. This will be my first Christmas that I will be spending away from home. While I admit Im a bit saddened that I wont get to spend this special time with my family, it gives me the opportunity to reflect on why I enjoy this holiday so much. . . is because it provides an enhanced opportunity to give back to others. Whether it is a small donation or a big gift, any form of giving back can change the life of someone else. I know from first hand experience during the holidays how impactful it can be to have someone lend a hand to help make this holiday special. So, while you are spending time with your families and enjoying the comfort of one another, remember to give back to others who dont quite have as much. SUE BIRD, SEATTLE STORM I've been home the last couple Falls. I think it's good for me, said Bird who has been rehabbing from hip surgery in Connecticut following the 2012 WNBA season, in preparation for reporting to her overseas team UMMC in Russia in January. It's a good balance between playing my basketball season and also getting some time to see friends, see family. It works. One of the best things about being in Connecticut is I'm very close to both New York and Boston, which are two places that I have friends and family in, Bird told StormBasketball.com . So it works out really well.",Raw Data
957,"Where Do You Hate Going? Seeing as its a Friday... It's Scottish League Cup semi-final weekend (stop laughing!) which this year means a trip to Hampden for St Mirren and Celtic. The discussion in the office concluded that everyone hates going to Hampden. The combination of bad view, terrible location and general rubbishness was echoed by all parties. With this in mind, my question to the esteemed contributors is - Which (rival) ground do you dislike visiting the most? And why? Craig ( this trips to hampden for league game are particularly bad) RFC Glasgow What Happened To Bacary Sagna? Re. Hoges email about Sagna's ability to repel the ball before it's passed to him. Granted, Arsenal have been generally sloppy this season, but to blame their passing in general on his absolutely shocking form is just wrong. I've never seen a player become so crap so quickly in such a short space of time. He can't control the ball. His crossing is woeful, just terribly bad. He's forgotten how to tackle. I'm surprised he can still remember how to run. By far, the stand out worst performer for Arsenal this season. I don't know what's wrong with him. Maybe he's lost his heart, or he's just turned crap. Either way, I'm past caring now. Thanks for your services. Please leave this summer and make way for Jenkinson. Kiraldo (and I was annoyed with him when he decided to leave my FIFA team a few months back).... What Makes A Good Goalie? Watching that Scott Carson howler will bring back some really bad memories for Baggies fans. Carson was perhaps one the worst goalkeepers to ever grace the Premier League. In nearly 3 years at the Albion he made one memorable save (in a 2-1 win against Liverpool) and gave a goal away nearly every week. So many times I have I witnessed him standing there with his hands on his hips looking mystified as he has thrown yet another goal into his net. He used to make me so angry and I am glad he is safely locked away in Turkey and that we now have the fabulous Ben Foster. He is fabulous. Truly tremendous. However the fact that Carson was ever allowed to become a professional just shows how little is known about what makes a good goalkeeper. De Gea is a case in point. Any fool can make the odd tremendous save by throwing their body around. Good goalkeeping is all about technique. Since January how many goals have Man Utd conceeded where De Gea has parried directly out to a striker. Getting to the ball anybody can do, disposing of it safely i.e. to the side requires technique. De Gea is not and never will be a good goalkeeper just like Carson because ultimately they have no technique. David Seaman was a brilliant goalkeeper. More often than not he did not need to make a brilliant saves because his technique and positioning was so good that he was in the right place. Yes there were a couple of errors (Nayim & Ronaldinho) but even the best will get it wrong occasionally. Joe Hart is a quality goalkeeper and yes his arrogance may have led to a couple of errors this season. But, a good keeper must be arrogant, to be able to stay calm, hold the ball and have the belief that if they come off their line they are going to get the ball. There is way to much ignorance even from the media about goalkeeping. The wrong skills have been valued. Best goalkeepers I have seen: Russell Hoult, David Seaman, Ben Foster, Jussi Jasskeleinen, Brad Friedel, Petr Cech, Andy Goram, Shay Given,Nigel Martyn. All a certain type and please do notice why I left Schmeichal off that list. Overrated and actually has a lot to answer for with standard of many current goalkeepers. Even Schmeichal fans would describe him as un-orthodox.Well a good keeper can't be un-orthodox because good keeping is about technique. Schmeichal was lucky to play with people Gary Neville who were always there to whack the ball away after it had bounced randomly off him. Kasey Keller who was a far better keeper, would make save after save only for one to bounce off him and for no defender to be there to clear. If Schmeichal would have played for Leicester or Southampton he would have been found out for the sub par keeper he really was. Ben (I could have included Alan Miller and Stuart Naylor in my good keeper list) Baggie. Still laughing at the Villa. Zaha: Not The Man? I'd rather have bought Isco or James Rodriguez. Even Viktor Fischer or Alen Halilovic, if real youth were required. Hate to say it, but Zaha looks an awful lot like a cheap-and-cheerful version of a Champions League quality attacking midfielder. Chris MUFC Wet Tuesday On a similar theme to Jack in Manchester about Berbaflop on the BBC, I'd advise people to take great care with spreading Football365 and football forum culture to the outside world. Last year, against my better judgement, I ventured on to the Daily Mail website to read a heartwarming story about a girl with no legs, who bravely battled back against illness to gain a place on her school football team. In the comments section, I asked the question I presumed would have been on everyone's lips: ""A truly inspirational story, but could she do it on a wet Tuesday night at Stoke?"" Hundreds red arrows and messages of hate followed. Most probably all deserved. Jamie (Never Again) Doherty Pop Dear TJ. I hate to point out the obvious but yes, Arsenal have underperformed over the past eight years or so and yes our former players have gone on to win stuff with other clubs. You may have missed this but Arsenal have a bloody great stadium to pay for. We have a stadium to pay for and have a debt but then so do United and every season we are farther down the road of clearing that date so I'm afraid there's bugger all chance of Wilshere following so called Arsenal fan Robin Van Persie. Sorry to burst your bubble Graham Simons, Gooner, Norf London Berbaflop Earliest reference I can find to Berbaflop was a Spurs fan http://spurs.theoffside.com/team-news/dimitar-berbatov-you-prick.html (understandably) annoyed after a summer of Berbatov batting eyes and making pretty at potential suitors. More interesting was Jol's quote in the piece ""Gifted, yes. But he is not a fighter. Perhaps you need others who are fighters to balance out the team""... Astute observation from the Dutchman. Sam (wishes we'd have spent the 30m on Bale), Sydney Flop Flop Mike, Chelsea, based in Auckland you're wrong about a lot of those players. I'd love to know what you're criteria for success of flop is because frankly I find the following from your list of flops a bit puzzling; Pogba young player who left the league to get more regular football hardly a glittering failure, Deschamps 1 year at the end of his career won an FA Cup wouldn't call him a resounding failure, Barthez 2 Premier Leagues in four years and overall some good performances while the United GK jersey was still a poisoned chalice from memories of Schmeichel, Dacourt was a fans favourite at Leeds where his performances established him the French team and only left because of a falling out with Venables, Koscielny inconsistent yes and prone to brain farts but he has had a good Premier League so far I could question a few other 'flops' you've listed based on age, your clear dislike of Arsenal players. I would question however why the players I've listed above are considered flops as opposed to players like Franc Quedrue (mid table journey man), Giles Grimandi (pretty average) Flamini (one really good season) who are 'hits'. If you're going to list off who's been a success or not gage how long they lasted, the level they played at or the trophies they won. Don't just base their success in the English game on whether you like them or not. Oh and Stphane Sessegnon is from Benin. Not born there and plays for France. Was born in Benin and plays for Benin. You could have at least bothered your hole paying attention to the nationality listing seeing as you were on Wikipedia any way instead of lazily going with 'sounds French must be French'. You said your selection was biased but forgot to forewarn us it was idiotic . On a constructive note if we're going to base this on success rate then the best contenders are countries with relatively few. Here's some of the best (success rate in brackets are surely) Zimbabwe (100%); Benjani Mwaruwari, Bruce Grobbelaar, Peter Ndlovu Oman (100%); Ali Al Habsi Admin Just a small, pedantic point, in response to MagnumPIG (10m on Coutinho is a waste however) The reason the likes of Benfica and Porto pick up steals from South America and sell them on for huge profits is probably actually to do with work permit regulations. Exciting stuff huh? In short, our regulations here are much stricter than in some other European countries. Another mailboxer may be able to tidy this up with exact figures, but I believe that for someone outside the EU to qualify for a work permit, they need to have played in a certain number of internationals, or an 'exceptional case' may be made for a player on appeal, usually involving a manager appearing before the Depratment for Work and Pensions, dropping to his knees and begging. In Portugal, these rules are a lot looser, and the presence of a Portuguse great great grandparent may help swing it too. I think British clubs know about some of these players, but the combination of language, culture and immigration rules mean Portugal (and Holland) are seen as better proving grounds for young South American talent before they take the next step to the 'big leagues'. Conrad Wiacek, MUFC The Spectacle Adam Shortland. It costs a significant amount of money to televise a football match, and typically television execs., sponsors, clubs, players, et al. all want to achieve the highest possible ratings, and present the best possible spectacle, when a match is televised. Unfortunately, in a milieu in which the FA Cup is widely broadcast abroad (no idea why, it's a joke of competition), that therefore guarantees that matches including United/Chelsea/Arsenal/City etc., particularly when against decent PL opposition, will be televised. It's in the interests of all concerned parties, and present a much better advert for English football than watching a lower league team defend desperately, hoof the ball, and try and score a scrappy goal, on a crap pitch against superior opposition. Chris MUFC ...Could Adam Shortland in this morning's mailbox please let me know how to watch the Arsenal game this weekend, cos I'm pretty bloody sure it's not on telly. It's also a potential cup upset, which simultaneously backs-up and destroys his argument: if it was on telly it would be the kind of banana-skin tie he wants to watch. But it's not. Steve Owen ...I agree with Adam Shortland about televised FA Cup matches. Man United have had their last 37 FA Cup ties televised. Yep, 37. In a row. This weekend makes it 38. Even as a Liverpool fan, this is in no way the fault of United, but of the appeal to the masses scheduling methodology. Broadcasters bang on about, ""The magic of the cup"" yet refuse to show it. In fact, United's last non-televised match was against Exeter which is exactly the sort of game that should be shown! Lee (as long as it's not on ITV though) LFC Doppelgangers We were in Tenerife having a meal and the guy responsible for the bill was the spitting image of Ronald Koeman, he was Belgian so the flemish accent only enhanced the restaurant owners belief that here was the guy who had scored the winning goal at Wembley for his beloved Barcelona delivering their first ever European Cup win, he couldn't have been more excited! The guy, lets call him Jacques, happily posed for photographs and signed autographs, talked about what a great moment it was for him and how much he loved his time at Barca. He graciously accepted the complimentary bottle of wine and liquors that followed. Then the bill arrived and he sheepishly turned to me and said ""can you get this, I can't ruin this mans evening and the story he'll tell for years by handing him my credit card with Jacques DeClerq on!"", knew I shouldn't have ordered the Chateaubriand! Howard (and we didn't get the business!) Jones ...In response to Phil Pearce in Thursdays mailbox... I too have an unexpected recognition story resulting in a random persons embarrassment. Unfortunately it's nobody of such great standing as the greatest Ginger Ninja of all time. Afew years ago my favourite great uncle passed away, and had the brainwave of making me executor of his estate because he deemed me to be the next 'man of the family'...being only in my twenties, when it came time to go through probate, I found myself attending the meetings with my mum as she had a clue what it was all about, and i was the obvious clueless idiot... Being in Manchester city centre early on the day all the forms were being finalised, we decided to pop for a coffee in one of those 'poncey sofas n armchairs style rip off coffee establishments'. While mum settled her arse in a purple Chesterfield, I did the honours and got mugged for 2 mochas. While stood there all suited n booted with the added suave of black leather jacket (not my usual daytime attire so was feeling unusually cool), I noticed my mam pissing herself in the corner. Once coffees were purchased and my wallet suitably lightened I went to find out what the joy was about on this sombre day. Turns out she'd been observing some poor woman wandering past, spot me from behind in the queue, freeze, dive into her bag for her phone and ring her fella/dad/son/male friend. Through the medium of lip reading mum observed this conversation... 'Hi it's me, no no shush listen. I'm on Deansgate n I've just seen ******* ****** in a coffee shop, I'm looking at him now...no honest I am!!...OK, what shall I say?...OK, yes I've got a pen...ok I'll ask...yes it's definately him!!...OK I'll ring you back.' Blissfully unaware I'm still queueing for my expensive hot chocolate, apparently she got through the door and within a few steps of nervously tapping me on the shoulder, then I stepped forward and placed my order. Apparently the realisation of my mancunian accent not bring the expected French stopped her from actually making me aware she was stalking me for an autograph...the moment of my half turn, to look at mum laughing she retreated,silently, with a face turning beetroot and quickly scurried off outside...I sauntered over to have my cool destroyed forever, my mum was laughing because I'd been mistaken, from behind in my defence, for the handsome ladykiller that is.... Fabien Barthez :-( the shame Jeff, Manchester MUFC ...In response to Phil Pearce email the other day about dooplegangers, I was at the villa/Bradford game on Tuesday just gone. Just got into the ground, waiting just past the tunstiles for my mates. A little kid and his dad passed me, and then lad looked up excitedly and said to his dad 'is that Alan Hutton? Thankfully his dad put him right straight away but I was absolutely gutted. Of all the big bald blokes, over all the sh*t footballers, it had to be him. Alan Bloody Hutton!

958,"For Dale Earnhardt Jr., January 11th is a day he wont soon forget. TRUE TEST NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers tried out the new-model car at Daytona. Take a look! Less than an hour into the drafting session of Preseason Thunder, Junior tagged the back of Marcos Ambroses Ford in an attempt to bump draft with the new Generation 6 car and wiped out two-thirds of the field. Junior learned a valuable lesson from his outing. Our cars dont line up quite as good as they used to, Earnhardt said. We sent some people home early from the test. Thats probably I thought long and hard and that was probably the most embarrassed Id ever been in a long time, as long as I can remember. Earnhardt didnt feel the need to apologize because he felt that it was clear the incident was simply a mistake. But NASCARs most popular driver was still contrite on Wednesday due to the attention and focus that was placed on the new car. Everyone was excited to see how they drafted and how things went, Earnhardt said. After that accident, no one wanted any more drafting. A lot of teams went home. I realized that its a new car. Everybody is there to learn new things and uncover specifics about the new car and a lot of that was taken away from those teams because of the mistake and the accident. It was like I short-handed a bunch of guys at that test. BOOGITY! BOOGITY! BOOGITY! Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Kobalt Tools 400 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday. Crew chief Steve Letarte said the best medicine for Earnhardt after the big one was to just put him back in the race car. If you have a quarterback that throws an interception, the best thing he can do is complete a pass same thing with him (Earnhardt), Letarte said. I understand where hes coming from. He respects the work that everyone is doing. He respects what we have going on as a sport. I can work with a guy that respects that a whole lot easier. Mistakes like that happen. Thats why we go test. Im sure here in three or four more weeks there will be a whole lot bigger crashes and we wont even remember the testing crash anymore. Earnhardt agrees. Its tough to recall the last time a restrictor plate race went green to the finish. You look at the last lap of all the plate races and I cant remember one that finished without an accident, Earnhardt said. Regardless of how the cars draft, how the drafting technique is, the potential for that accident at the end of these races is way high. It ramps way up beyond what we will see in the majority of the race. MOVING FORWARD Check out the 2013 Sprint Cup Toyota Camry. Earnhardt doesnt feel the need to proselytize to his competitors about being over aggressive in the race. Its up to each competitor to learn how the draft works and what the limitations of the cars are on their own. If there was an upside to the accident, Earnhardt says it was having a better understanding of how the bumpers of cars are going to react if at all. Still, in the time Earnhardt spent on the track he was able to develop what he believes will be a comfortable feel in the car. The draft really reminds me a lot of how we had the cars probably in 06, 07 and the cars pull up well and you can work with other people even though the bumpers dont particularly line up exactly the way they used to in the past couple of years, Earnhardt said. The way you help people is going to lend itself more to how you did it six or seven years ago. I think the racing will be a lot more of a success as a product with that happening. Im really excited about that and look forward to sort of getting back to that older style of plate racing and I think it will provide a really good Daytona 500.",Raw Data
959,"﻿Stephen Maguire has set himself the challenge of rapidly adding to his trophy haul after ending the hurt of his five-year wait to win a ranking event title at the BetVictor Welsh Open. The Scot showed tremendous nerve and character in Newport as he battled back from 7-5 down to eventually prevail 9-8 after a final-frame shoot-out with Stuart Bingham and take the £50,000 first prize. Maguire's last title had come at the China Open in 2008, since when he has lost three finals, including in Wales in 2011. The Glaswegian's talent has never been in doubt, but he admitted he had been unsure whether he would ever end another tournament as the man holding the trophy. It sets the 31-year-old up nicely for the World Championship, but Maguire is not looking too far ahead, instead wanting to add another victory to his tally before heading to the Crucible in April. ""I feel great now and I will feel great for the next few days. But I have another tournament coming up in China very soon and I want to be able to push on from here,"" he said. ""I don't want it to be five years before I win another trophy, that was too long and I was starting to doubt if I would ever do it again. Now I am back in the winner's enclosure it is very important I push on. ""I want to make sure I do not lose touch with the boys who have been winning tournaments. There have been guys winning tournaments who I think I am better than and it was hurting me. ""A lot can happen between now and the World Championship, there are three tournaments and I would like to win another trophy. ""This year's World Championship is wide open but it does not get better than winning a tournament, particularly as it is getting harder every year."" Maguire was particularly pleased with the resolve he showed with the final apparently slipping away from him. There were moments during the 12th and 13th frames where he looked a beaten man, sitting in his chair with his head in his hands, but he bounced back up off the canvas. ""I was very pleased with the way I finished the match, especially after I let him get back to 8-8 after I had been leading 8-7, at that point I thought I had let it go,"" he said. ""I had to have a few words with myself and I was chuffed to get the chance to win it and make it count."" Bingham was devastated to have seen a match-winning position slip through his fingers, particularly a simple pink he missed to make it 8-5 when Maguire was struggling. But the Essex player, who is set to climb to seventh in the world rankings, is confident he is heading in the right direction with Sheffield looming on the horizon. He said: ""I am gutted, it would have meant so much to secure the trophy. But it has been a brilliant week and I've pulled a few matches out of the fire against Neil Robertson and Ding Junhui. ""Maybe I am biased but I think I was the better player in the final, I came out and took the game to him in the evening session and when it went to 7-5 I had chances but I blew them. ""But my game is in good shape, hopefully if I can stay high in the rankings it will give me confidence because I have had a great season.""",Raw Data

961,"﻿As the San Francisco 49ers lurched back Sunday in the second half of a jaw-dropping NFC Championship Game revival to an almost surreal 28-24 victory, the DeBartolo York clan — uncle, sister, nephew … heck, the entire huge, loving, united family — transformed another precious Super Bowl opportunity for this hallowed NFL franchise into a Norman Rockwell portrait. “How can you NOT just love that?” bellowed 49ers tight end Vernon Davis, who caught five Colin Kaepernick passes for 106 yards, one of those the quarterback’s only TD throw. “This is really a big family and we did this as a family.” The passing of the Halas Trophy became the bridge from DeBartolo’s unprecedented five Super Bowl championships as the 49ers colorful owner, directly to his sister and nephew, the 49ers’ current matriarch and the team’s daily curator. A new Lombardi Trophy, they hope, is on its way. “It’s just … it's family,” said Jed York, his eyes red with tears of pride, and joy. “We wanted to make sure we showed that Eddie won five Super Bowls, and that’s unheard of. He was the best owner from the time he started (1977) until the time he finished (23 years later).” This could be a season of destiny for the Harbaugh-led 49ers. See who's in the playoffs, and when they play. “The 49ers are a family, whether it’s the DeBartolo York family, whether it’s the entire organization. We take care of each other, and this was a special day.” Eddie DeBartolo, who is a Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist for the second consecutive year, has had a direct role in guiding his nephew’s path , both as a hands-on owner and an NFL mover and shaker at age 31. A new 49ers stadium is being built in Santa Clara, and that is testament to York’s business acumen. But Eddie’s presence also keeps Jed’s mind focused on the franchise’s storied heritage. Who were Sunday’s honorary team captains for San Francisco? DeBartolo, Charles Haley — another Hall of Fame finalist — and beloved longtime defensive end Bryant Young. “Thank God for my son,” said Denise DeBartolo York, who admitted she nearly went mad in the fourth quarter, as the game swung wildly back in the 49ers’ favor amid Atlanta’s deafening roar inside the Georgia Dome. “He asked me, ‘Is it OK, can we have Eddie, Bryant Young and Charles Haley?’” Denise said of Jed’s request last week. “Of course! It brought it full circle. It really did. It’s extremely emotional.” And Eddie D? Always emotional and prone to grandiose gestures, DeBartolo huddled with Jed privately on Saturday night in Atlanta. He had some important things he needed to pass on to his nephew. 1. A pair of gold, football-shaped cufflinks, a gift originally given to Eddie in 1981 — the season the Joe Montana-led team beat Cincinnati in Super Bowl XVI. Those cufflinks came from the 49ers’ founding family, the Morabitos. ""Think of that connection, that tradition,"" Jed said, showing them off with pride. ""These are just amazing."" 2. An 8x10 framed photo Eddie has kept on his wall since that inaugural Super Bowl run. In it, five-year-old Jed is standing alongside Eddie DeBartolo Sr. Jed is holding a sign. “Dear Uncle Eddie, We love you. Congratulations and we love the 49ers.” “It's been on my wall 30 years. My dad and Jed are in that picture,” said DeBartolo, choking back his own tears. “And I gave it to Jed, and I put my own note with it. Eddie's note read, ""Dear Jed, Now it's your turn. Love, Uncle Eddie” With that, Eddie began to cry. Said Kaepernick, “To see that family extend their love to all of us, that just makes all of this seem really special. I feel like they love me.” This is how the DeBartolo Yorks do it. “It’s tradition. Everyone throws the word ‘dynasty’ out there, but I don’t know about dynasties,” DeBartolo said. “But you know what it is? It’s a tradition that (Jed) worked so hard to get.” Jed York hired general manager Trent Baalke and coach Jim Harbaugh, and together they kept this team largely intact. The surprise group that made it to the 2011 NFC Championship Game but fell to the New York Giants got another crack at it. They also had the guts to hand the ball to Kaepernick in Week 11, and let the high-octane read-option offense explode into playoff lore. DeBartolo stood off to the side as the 49ers’ locker room celebrated, and he gushed in awe of what he saw from the front office on down. “Jed stays in the background,” Eddie D said proudly. “He’s done that all year and he did that tonight.” Sort of. York was front and center as 49ers’ players hugged and congratulated him afterward because, well, this win was — yes — a family affair. As the 49ers clawed out of their 17-0 first half deficit, York cradled his infant son, Jax, for comfort. “I wasn’t feeling great,” confessed York, “so I picked up Jax and held him, the whole way down, until we scored. He just put me at ease. I just felt good. I felt then we could come back and win.” Oh yes, they did. “This is the culmination of many, many years,” DeBartolo said, wiping his eyes. “They’re my family. And they’ve done a really good job. It’s one more game, but so what? “It’s just the Super Bowl.” And that’s one game this family knows very, very well.",Raw Data

964,"Dana White gave the strongest hint yet at yesterdays London press conference that the UFC is moving towards a new television deal in the UK this summer without revealing the network and indicated that events in the future will be programmed into set dates throughout the year. Heres what we are working on dates in London, Manchester, Dublin and several other places in the UK. We do them every year, the same date every year, and with the right television deal we bring big fights over here, he explained at the news conference to announce Saturdays main event fights at Wembley Arena, with Renan Barao headlining in a defence of the interim bantamweight title against Michael McDonald. [The plan is that] we work out a deal for 3 years hopefully it would be 30 years but we work out a deal and we see how it goes, and build big events in these places same time every year, added White. Thats what we are working on with Garry [Cook, the UFCs EMEA CEO] right now. That way, people can count on it, people know when it is coming, its a destination. When you know theres going to be a date every year at the 02 in London, people will travel from all over the country. White is convinced Cook understands the landscape. We have the right guy, he has the right ideas and we are getting s*** done over here. Finally this stuff is going to get taken care of, and its going to get done, the right way. We are going to get the UK sorted out. But not just the UK. We are doing work down in South Africa, too. Working on some pretty cool stuff too ? White was asked if he expected that to be a done deal this year. That, he said, lay with the UFCs EMEA CEO Cook. Given the UFCs current strategy of wanting to maintain itself as a global company, but keep relevant regionally, it appears that the UFC may plan to have a series of regional events annually, with a headliner each year. That, one suspects, would be the 02 Arena event White hinted at today, which would also lend itself to a fan exposition, an oft-requested addition from fans after the success of the London Expo in 2011. The issue with that one was that Earls Court was so far from the 02 Arena. As the UFC seeks to open new markets, and develop others, it seems that regionalised norms may fall into place. That would develop the local markets to meet the top of the food chain which currently exists in the UFC, with the top 450 fighters currently on its roster across eight weight divisions. Elsewhere, White revealed yesterday that ""people were making fake IDs to get in"" at Trinity College in Dublin on Tuesday this week, where he picked up an honorary award, and admitted that while in Temple Bar, ""yapping my big mouth off"" had set off a series of news tweets from Irish fans. White also hopes that the winner of Barao and McDonald for the interim 135lbs title will face injured bantamweight champion Dominic Cruz this summer. ""Hes gonna have to get back into training,"" said White, who does not want to strip Cruz of the title. Fox loves him. Well see how this thing plays out. I'm hoping the winner of this fights him in the summer. White also revealed that female fighter 'Cyborg' Santos had behaved in a peculiar manner with the organisation after being offered a contract, and the prospect of fighting on other organisations while opponents for the featherweight fighter were sought. On he heavyweight scene, White insisted that Antonio Silva had earned a rematch with Cain Velasquez, this time for the UFC title, given his explosive third round victory over Alistair Overeem earlier this month.",Raw Data
965,"MIAMI Friday was improv night for the Miami Heat. Guard Ray Allen threw a pass directly to his head coach and went in for a rare dunk, which led to cracks from teammates. Forward Shane Battier, known for being allergic to the paint, actually attempted and made a hook shot in the lane, and everybody laughed. Sunday, though, will be all business. The Heat got their joking out of the way in a 102-93 home win over lowly Philadelphia to extend their winning streak to 17 games. That ties the Los Angeles Clippers for the NBA's longest this season. But when the Heat go for No. 18, it will be against the last team that beat them and an outfit that has kicked sand in their faces this season. That would be the Indiana Pacers, who last defeated Miami 102-89 on Feb. 1 and who have won both meetings this season, with the average margin being 11.5 points. ""We're well aware they've absolutely pounded us,"" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. ""They've beaten us up. What else do you want to say?"" Sunday at AmericanAirlines Arena will be a night for drama. Maybe there also will be some crime-show elements considering the last time the teams played in Miami it was a playoff slugfest featuring flagrant fouls and two players being suspended soon after. At least the Heat (46-14) on Friday could warm up with a comedy night. Miami, which got 25 points from LeBron James and 22 from Dwyane Wade, fell behind by as many as nine points early in the third quarter, but nobody on the home team was ever worried against a 76ers team (23-38) that now has lost 11 of its last 12. The funny business started late in the first quarter when Allen whipped a pass that a wide-open Spoelstra caught in front of his bench. Then Allen, 37, threw down a rare dunk late in the second quarter. ""He's getting younger,"" Spoelstra said. ""He went back 10 years in time."" By the fourth quarter, another sharpshooter strayed from his usual spot. Battier, who had a streak in which 44 straight field goals he had attempted were 3-pointers and another in which his last 39 field goals made had been 3-pointers, actually hit a hook shot in the lane. ""Well, sometimes you got to be a contrarian,"" Battier said. ""Sometimes, you got to break the mold. (Battier's teammates) were shocked. They were absolutely shocked when I went into the paint. It was like a no-fly zone."" But when questions about the Pacers (39-23) came up, the laughter died down. The Heat are stone-faced serious about their next game. ""Forget about the winning streak,"" said Bosh, whose Heat on Friday became the first NBA team to clinch a playoff berth and moved ahead of San Antonio (48-15) for the league's best record. ""If we had lost a few in a row, we would still be ready for Sunday."" Bosh said two games in March the Heat had ""circled for some time"" on their calendars were last Sunday's at New York and the one against Indiana, teams that started out 2-0 against Miami. The first order of business was taken care of with a 99-93 win over the Knicks. Next on the Heat hit list is the Pacers. ""It's our turn being at home to come out and take care of business,"" Wade said. ""We want to beat a team that's beaten us handily the first two times."" It's the last meeting between the teams this regular season and Indiana's only Miami visit. If the Heat can win Sunday, it would mark the first time in their 25-year history they've beaten every other NBA team in the regular season. ""That's another piece of motivation,"" Spoelstra said. The teams have a growing rivalry, one that got quite physical in the Heat's 4-2 win over the Pacers in an Eastern Conference semifinal last May. Game 5, Indiana's last visit to Miami, featured Udonis Haslem and since-departed Dexter Pittman of Miami and Tyler Hansbrough of the Pacers all getting flagrant fouls. Haslem received a one-game suspension and Pittman a three-game penalty for both having decked Indiana players. While the Pacers ended up wilting in that series and losing the final three games, they have been the more physical team in this season's meetings. They beat the Heat 87-77 on Jan. 8 and had the win to start off last month. In the two games, the bigger Pacers have won the battle of the boards by a whopping average of 14.0 per game. ""They've got us really good twice,"" James told Sun Sports in an on-the-court interview following Friday's game. ""So we look forward to the challenge It's going to be an Eastern Conference showdown. You guys know I'll be in uniform, so I'll be ready."" James said Indiana plays ""smashmouth"" basketball. Now, the Heat would love to smash the Pacers. Nobody is expecting comedy Sunday.",Raw Data
966,"Created by Mason Gordon, SlamBall was birthed out of a warehouse in Los Angeles, and for a time appeared as the next big thing in the sporting world. The premise of SlamBall was simple, combine the elements of basketball, hockey, football, and gymnastics to provide a fast-paced and physical game, that provided awe-inspiring aesthetics similar to the video game culture that was quickly growing throughout America. The execution however proved to be difficult. Gordon, like many innovators, needed partners. He turned to television producer Mike Tollin to make his dream become a reality. “He (Tollin) saw that I was either insane or I was onto something and he committed to work with me to develop the game. We’ve been working together ever since to build the sport toward global awareness and an international infrastructure.” (SlamBall History) Tollin was reluctant at first, but ultimately took on the task, becoming the co-creator of SlamBall in the process. In 200o, the first game of Slamball was played in a make shift half-court equipped with a basketball net and one spring-board. The game featured Gordon and five other players with experiences ranging from football to college, and street basketball. Mason tells an account of the first SlamBall court: “It wasn’t a pretty site, I mean at one point I think one of the players actually fell through the floor” The first games on the half-court served as a lesson to Gordon that changes were needed to allow for a relatively safe, flowing, and defensive game. The final rendition featured a court that measured 100 feet by 62 feet, with two sets of four trampoline “quads” at each end of the court. The court also featured a Plexiglas wall similar to a hockey rink. While the court has changed a bit since, this the fundamental structure has remained With a court that fit the demands of the game, Gordon added more players and continued to build the sport from the ground up. In 2001, the first two teams were created: The Mob and The Rumble. The game consisted of four players, divided into three positions: Handler: Essentially the point guard of the team, controlling the offensive flow. Gunner: Primary scorer of the team, comparable to a forward in hockey. Stopper: Speaks for itself, goal is to prevent the gunner from dunking, and goal tending shots taken within the spring-board area. SlamBallers competing mid-air. Scoring followed a similar system to basketball, a three-point arc, two points within the arc, and in a SlamBall twist: dunks counting for 3 points. The two teams played a series of games in East L.A. which were open to the public. The spectators were quickly impressed, and Gordon was quick to act. Mason utilizing his partnership with Tollin, had the producer bring in media to witness the hard-hitting, high-flying, and aesthetically profound game first-hand. This rewarded SlamBall with an exclusive contract with The Nashville Network (TNN), who were re-branding themselves as Spike TV. Spike TV and the fall of SlamBall In 2002, Mason held his first combine of 400 potential players and from that kept 60, they would become the first professional SlamBall players. The summer of 2002 marked SlamBall’s debut on Spike TV. The season took six-days to complete, but aired pre-recorded in a six-week television event. SlamBall featured six teams in total: The Mob, Rumble, Bouncers, Diablos, Slashers and Steal. Spike TV’s investment was an instant hit with the fans, Gordon was the least bit surprised: ”Conceptually, it sounds like a wild and crazy and wacky idea, but when you put a bunch of sports into a blender, it works,”. The outdoor court used at Universal City, California for the 2003 season. Gordon’s game became one for the every-man, as 20,000 applicants reached out to Gordon in hopes of becoming SlamBallers. Growth continued in preparation for the 2003 season, SlamBall added two new teams: The Bandits and Riders, along with a new court. The 2003 debut brought in 2.3 million viewers, which was a 43% increase from 2002′s edition, and topped traditional sporting programs in the process. However, 2003 would be the end of the partnership between Mason/Tollin and Spike TV. A few years earlier TNN, Spike TV’s predecessor, featured sports entertainment products such as Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and RollerJam. Gordon hinted that this was the direction Spike TV wanted to take with SlamBall. “The ratings were great,” Gordon said. “But ultimately, they wanted to go in directions we weren’t totally comfortable with. We didn’t see SlamBall as a packaged entertainment product like the Harlem Globetrotters or professional wrestling. We saw SlamBall as a legitimate sport.” SlamBall Post-Spike TV With no network home, Mason and Mike did not give up their goal on building SlamBall into a household name. Instead the two took the previous success of the sport and went across the sea to Italy. Italia 1 debuted SlamBall in 2007, and enjoyed similar success. This led the talent agency International Management Group (IMG) to team with Gordon and Tollin. The goal of IMG was to reunite the U.S. with SlamBall. With financial backing from IMG, the 2008 season of SlamBall was televised on Versus and CBS. IMG attempted to broker a deal with Cartoon Network to air the sport in 2009, however the deal fell through leaving SlamBall out of American networks once again. SlamBall appeared in Australia for a year in 2009, but has yet to return to mainstream American television. Mason Gordon’s SlamBall is still alive, and Mike Tollin is still involved in the production. Tollin believes there is still promise for SlamBall to return to its early glory. “There’s a sense that it’s still out there in the consciousness,” Tollin said. “And people say, ‘What happened to it?’” However, the broadcasting now only exists within the realm of the Internet. Six teams make up SlamBall, and highlights from the sport showcase on Facebook and YouTube. SlamBall continues to build globally as well with the creation of SlamBall Australia. Nevertheless, given the state of the global economy and the lack of historic establishment within SlamBall, the sports’ proliferation looks bleak, and the growth is nowhere near what it was in 2002-03. Gordon has acknowledged the pain-staking process growing SlamBall has become. “There’s nothing easy about this,” said Mason Gordon, the Co-Creator of SlamBall “This is about getting your face kicked in day in and day out. Not just for months or for years, but for a long period of time.” Time will judge if SlamBall’s story is that of redemption, or a slow and painful demise.",Raw Data

968,"﻿Although the sport’s most popular driver still has inventory for sale on the No. 88 Chevrolet, Earnhardt believes “things are on the upswing.” “We have a unique, limited amount of races to fill, and those packages aren’t the most exciting propositions for corporate America to come in and do an eight-race deal,” Earnhardt said Wednesday. “You have to find the right guy that’s interested in something that size and is willing to fit the price range you want as a team. ""You can’t undersell compared to what you’re working with on the other races and the contracts you have in place. Everything has to align itself, and there’s other opportunities out there.” The lack of sponsorship on Earnhardt’s car doesn’t seem to concern team owner Rick Hendrick, who also has several races for sale for Kasey Kahne’s program. Hendrick Motorsports is by far the most successful organization currently in NASCAR. In the past dozen years, Hendrick drivers have won six Sprint Cup titles. In the short term, Hendrick believes that finding the proper fit for Earnhardt is more important than making a hasty decision. “We’re always talking, working with people,” Hendrick said. “You can take the short-term deal and fill the car up, or you can try to work with someone that’s a long-term situation for years to come. The way we’re positioned, our cars are covered until the end of the summer. I don’t have a timeline. I’m looking for the right deal — not any deal. If I wanted any deal, I would put Hendrick Cars on it. We have two or three deals that are close, but we’re looking beyond 2013. We’re looking at 2014 and 2015. We haven’t put a line in the sand.” SUPER STAR Junior's impact goes well beyond the track. CAREER MOMENTS Earnhardt understands his branding. The third-generation driver has enjoyed extremely successful runs with Budweiser in the past, and his reach with the National Guard and other military programs has been stout. Earnhardt also realizes that the race-sponsorship market is cyclical and agrees with his boss that patience is prudent. “There are 15-race deals that were available, but, like Rick said, we feel like we can be patient and find the right package and the right deal that’s a good fit for me and something that I’m going to enjoy working with and something that will be around for more than one year or a couple of years,” Earnhardt said. “They usually like to work with people that are interested in working their way up into the sport starting with a package that is kind of small and working their way into a full-time deal or a multiyear deal with teams. “I’m not really worried about it, but I think it’s at the tail end of the reset that we had several years ago. I think it’s the remnants of that. Everything else seems to be moving in the right direction.

970,"Eurosport - 2012 GOLF Hunter Mahan The American knows full well that matchplay golf can be extremely fickle and he believes his best strategy is to be as aggressive as possible while trying to forget about what happened at Dove Mountain 12 months ago. ""Last year has nothing to do with this year,"" Mahan, 30, said while preparing for Wednesday's opening round in the Arizona desert. ""The road will be just as hard as last year. ""There's no defending here. It's just trying to win this week, trying to beat the guys who are going to play in front of you and that's going to be a tough challenge. The score is kind of irrelevant."" Mahan beat Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy 2&1 in last year's final to claim his second WGC crown, ending a week of dominant golf that began with his closest match on the opening day. After scraping past fellow American Zach Johnson in a first-round clash that lasted 19 holes, Mahan took full control of his next five matches while playing what he described as some of the best golf of his life. ""First match last year I didn't play great and I was lucky to get a win versus Zach, but from there I started playing better,"" he recalled of a week in which he totalled 35 birdies in 96 holes. ""My game from the driver to the putter, every part of it, was strong. It was some of the best golf that I ever played."" Mahan's list of victims last year included US Ryder Cup players Matt Kuchar and Steve Stricker, 2009 US PGA Championship winner Yang Yong-eun of South Korea and McIlroy, who was then the world number two. The American did not trail in any match that week after the third hole of his encounter with Yang in the second round, a contest he went on to win 5&3, and he is aiming for a similarly aggressive approach this week. ""You've got to be aggressive from the first tee, try to hit a lot of good quality shots and try to put pressure on your opponent,"" said Mahan, who will face Italy's Matteo Manassero in the opening round on Wednesday. ""You have to play good. That's the only thing that matters. There's no sort of lucky charm or anything like that ""This isn't really a place to sit back and let your opponent make a mistake. That's when you're going to lose."" Asked who he rated as the best matchplay golfers assembled at Dove Mountain this week, Mahan replied with a grin: ""(Ian) Poulter, I think Tiger (Woods) is a great match play player and probably Luke Donald. ""Luke is just the ultimate match play player because he's a guy that can easily chip in from anywhere, change the kind of momentum of a match. He's a great putter. No matter where he is, he's never going to be really out of a hole. ""Poults just has a will about him that makes him a good player. And then Tiger is just a great player in general, and he just doesn't like to lose. That's always a great motivator.""

Wenger acknowledged Brighton were the better team in the first half and was pleased with how his players responded to the challenge against a Championship club. ""Brighton made it very difficult for us and were sharper than us in the first half. They had a great spirit today,"" said the Arsenal boss. ""But in the end we had that little bit of extra quality to get us through. We did our job, but needed to fight until the end.""

972,"SCOTT FUJITA (now with the Cleveland Browns) is suspended for one game. He had been suspended for three games. In a letter to Fujita, Commissioner Goodell said: “While I have not found that you directly contributed to the bounty pool, there is no serious question that you were aware of the pool and its elements, including that it provided rewards for cart-offs. Indeed, Mr. [Jonathan] Vilma testified that Coach [Gregg] Williams brought the program to the team’s defensive leaders before the 2009 season and that you supported and endorsed it. Your own comments confirm that players were encouraged to ‘crank up the John Deere tractor and cart those guys off’ the playing field. “I am surprised and disappointed by the fact that you, a former defensive captain and a passionate advocate for player safety, ignored such a program and permitted it to continue. You made clear to me that participation in the program was voluntary and that other players could have refused to participate, as you claim to have done. If you had spoken up, perhaps other players would have refused to participate and the consequences with which we are now dealing could have been avoided. “I believe that everyone in the NFL, including players, has an obligation to promote fair and safe play, and to protect the integrity of the game. Your failure to act contributed to allowing this program to remain in place not only during the 2009 season, but for two additional seasons after that. There also remains the matter of your admitting to having essentially run your own rewards program, separate and apart from the program in which Coach Williams was involved, in which you paid or offered to pay teammates for ‘big plays’ such as forced fumbles or sacks. As you described the payments at our recent meeting, they were entirely independent of Coach Williams, the Club, or any Club Affiliate. As you further noted, you would pay such pledges only if the Saints won the game. This conduct is itself a violation of Article IX, Sections 9.1(c)(8) and 9.3(F) of the Constitution and Bylaws. “I find that your violation of the rule, which protects the integrity of the game, constitutes conduct detrimental to the League. Accordingly, I have determined that you should be suspended without pay for one game. For the avoidance of doubt, none of this discipline is imposed because your offers or payments to other players were not disclosed to the League. If you had disclosed your offers or payments, they still would have violated the Constitution and Bylaws provisions discussed above and constituted conduct detrimental. “ ANTHONY HARGROVE (now a free agent) is suspended for seven games, reduced from eight games. He will be credited for five games missed while a free agent, and will serve a two-game suspension once he is signed by a club. In a letter to Hargrove, Commissioner Goodell said: POWER RANKINGS Which teams are looking up in this week's NFL power rankings? “I find that you engaged in conduct detrimental by falsely denying, when questioned by an NFL Security representative, both the existence of the Saints’ program and the pledge of a substantial payment to any member of the Saints’ defensive unit who knocked Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. The existence of the program has been admitted by numerous Saints coaches and players, and is plainly established by the documents obtained from the club. And, based on substantial evidence, including written declarations made under penalty of perjury by two program participants whom I find credible, I have found that a member of the Saints defensive unit made such a pledge with respect to Mr. Favre. “My finding that you misled the NFL Security representative and obstructed the League’s investigation is corroborated by your own Declaration and by numerous statements made by you in our meeting of September 18 that were themselves not credible. “In response to a request for clarification from System Arbitrator Burbank, I previously advised you that the ‘vast majority’ of your discipline was based on your lack of candor to the League’s investigators. So that there is no question about the basis on which discipline is being imposed, I find that your misleading a League investigator and your obstruction of the League’s investigation constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of professional football.” WILL SMITH of the Saints is suspended for four games. There is no change to his suspension. “At our meeting in September, you confirmed that you expressed approval of the program when it was first presented to you by Coach Williams. You also confirmed that you provided money to the program pool both at the beginning of the season and again during the playoffs. I understand that you deny that anyone intended to inflict injury on any opposing player. Even in the face of repeated appeals to ‘crank up the John Deere tractor and cart the guy off,’ you and others now claim that the objective was instead merely to ‘knock the wind out’ of your opponents, requiring them to leave the game for only a play or two. From the standpoint of player safety, fair competition, and the integrity of the game, the issues with which I am concerned today, this kind of after-the-fact explanation is little more than wordplay that, in my judgment as Commissioner, offers no basis on which to excuse conduct that does not belong in professional football. Such behavior is conduct detrimental without regard to the precise extent or duration of the disability intended.",Raw Data
973,"﻿USC coach Lane Kiffin, asked about his job security following Saturday's 38-28 loss to UCLA, casually mentioned that university higher-ups told him he would be back next season, it was as if everyone in the room arched an eyebrow in unison. Really? Kiffin, who was called a ""flat-out liar"" by Al Davis when he was fired by the Raiders, had earlier this season told reporters he had not voted USC No. 1 in the USA Today preseason poll. When the poll voters were released, Kiffin indeed had. So, now, after the Trojans lost their fourth game of a season in which turnovers, penalties and special-teams snafus have been accompanied by the familiar litany of antics under Kiffin, such a bold proclamation — with the nationally televised game against unbeaten Notre Dame next week — required confirmation from athletic director Pat Haden. Unfortunately for Kiffin, that credibility problem extends beyond what comes out of his mouth. Questions about whether he could coach — his brief stints with the Raiders and the University of Tennessee were unimpressive but inconclusive — appeared to be put aside during last season's resurgence. But with the Trojans, who were ranked 18th before Saturday, on the cusp of becoming the first preseason No. 1 to finish unranked in 48 years, Kiffin's reputation is as battered as his quarterback, Matt Barkley, who left the Rose Bowl with his right arm in a sling with an apparent separated shoulder. Perhaps it was the comfort of Haden's assurance, but Kiffin fully accepted the blame for the defeat. ""Obviously, we're extremely disappointed; I'm extremely disappointed in this season,"" said Kiffin, who is in the third season of a five-year contract that was to pay him $2.5 million, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. ""We are too talented to have this many losses, and that falls on me."" For the Trojans, nothing seems to come off cleanly, on or off the field. They were punished by the Pac-12 and a manager was fired for deflating footballs against Oregon — an act Kiffin says he was unaware of. Kiffin also had his holder, the backup quarterback, to switch jerseys with the punter to better execute a fake. He also banned a reporter from practice for reporting an injury, and this week, Tennessee was further penalized for misconduct that took place under his watch. None of those acts appear to be egregious, but each of them chip away at Kiffin's credibility and the goodwill he might have built with fans. And in Los Angeles, perhaps it is wise not to diminish the consequences when great expectations, in concert with a demanding fan base, are not met. After all, wasn't Jim Buss praising Mike Brown, who also had the temerity to suffer four losses, the day before he fired him? Brown inspired as little confidence as Kiffin appears to be doing. Here it is mid-November and the Trojans, 7-4, have yet to put together a complete effort. There have been times when the defense has played well, where the offense has clicked and the penalties, turnovers and special teams have been cleaned up. But it has yet to happen in the same game. As to how this has happened, the players are baffled. Asked what he would have done if someone had told him in August that the Trojans would have four losses now, star receiver Marqise Lee, whose fumble led to a UCLA touchdown, said: ""I'd have laughed."" And then Lee did just that. If Kiffin is the target of the criticism, the poster boy for the Trojans' shortcomings has been Barkley, who shocked and delighted USC fans when he announced he would return for his senior season. Barkley was regarded as a top 10 pick if he had entered the NFL draft last April, after going toe to toe in a shootout with Andrew Luck last season and playing brilliantly down the stretch when the Trojans capped their bowl-banned season with a victory at No. 2-ranked Oregon and thumping UCLA, 50-0. Barkley's last play Saturday — and perhaps for the season — ended with him prostrate on the turf after UCLA defensive end Anthony Barr leveled him with a blindside hit in the final minutes. Barkley was a forlorn figure as he walked off the field with his helmet on, his left arm rocking back and forth, but his right arm hanging stiffly at his side. As he headed up the tunnel toward the locker room, UCLA fans above him roared their school's fight song. The Trojans' problems run deeper than quarterback, but Barkley's mistakes again were prominent. He threw two interceptions — and now has 15 for the season — including his first throw, which was poor and picked off by Aaron Hester and led to a touchdown. He also threw another in the fourth quarter. Barkley finished 20 for 38 for 301 yards and three touchdowns, and led a late USC charge, but in a series where the Trojans have enjoyed a clear advantage at quarterback since Cade McNown led UCLA to the brink of a national title, Barkley was outplayed by UCLA freshman Brett Hundley. ""You wouldn't expect we would lose this game with a senior quarterback versus a freshman,"" Kiffin said. ""Usually you don't."" Seven NFL teams had scouts at the game, and while Barkley still makes many NFL-type throws each Saturday, he also raises many questions with his inconsistency. And the Trojans' pratfall has raised questions about his leadership. ""I love watching him play,"" said UCLA coach Jim Mora, the former NFL head coach and defensive coordinator. ""When you have so much confidence, as he does because he's done the things that he's done, you try to stick it in there. You have this internal belief that you can make the throw, and that's not always the case. And then I think at times ... "" Mora paused for a moment. ""I don't want to get into his psyche,"" Mora said. ""He's a great player."" When Barkley emerged from the locker room, his throwing arm in a sling, he took only four questions before being cut off by the school's media spokesman. One of them was whether he had any regrets coming back. ""No,"" Barkley said. ""I don't regret it. There's nothing you can do. Why sit and pout about it? It isn't how I expected it to turn out, but as of now, you have to be optimistic about how we can finish the season on a good note."" That will take some doing. Notre Dame, which few expected to be anywhere near a major bowl, now is in a position to play for a national championship with a victory over USC. In many respects, the Irish are the anti-Trojans — a gritty group with a stout defense and a knack for making key plays when they matter most. The Trojans fell behind by 24 points to UCLA and rallied to within 31-28, but were let down by the defense, which could not stop the Bruins. ""This is not an easy one to take, an easy one to swallow,"" Kiffin said, adding that his team was not prepared to play. ""It's crushing. When you start where we did, the expectations we had, we felt like even though we screwed some things up, win this one and win the next one, at least you end with a good feeling to the regular season. This is inexcusable."" Really? You'll just have to take Kiffin's word for it.",Raw Data
974,"The details really don't matter. All anyone will remember is that Ashley Wagner now has something in common with Michelle Kwan. Wagner became the first woman since Kwan in 2005 to win back-to-back titles in the US Figure Skating Championships, managing to hold off up-and-comer Gracie Gold despite two falls Saturday night. ""To join that type of a club with Michelle is absolutely an honor, and I'm so pleased with myself that I was able to accomplish that,"" Wagner said. ""That was one of my main goals this season. I wanted to say I was a repeat national champion. I definitely lucked out at this competition. ""Knowing that, it only pushes me more to have the rest of the season be nice and solid."" Wagner finished with 188.84 points, about two ahead of Gold. Gold won the free skate — posting the second-highest score ever at the US meet, no less. But the 17-year-old had too much ground to make up after a dismal performance Thursday night in the short program left her in ninth place, more than 13 points behind Wagner. ""This is my first US Championships and it was horrifying at the beginning. But now it's been amazing,"" said Gold, who won the US junior title last year. ""I'm so proud of myself that I was able to come back after that very, very rough short program and to put out that long program that's the best I've ever done."" Agnes Zawadzki dropped from second to third after falling on her a triple flip. Earlier Saturday, Olympic silver medalists and 2011 world champions Meryl Davis and Charlie White won their fifth consecutive dance title, matching a US record. Marissa Castelli and Simon Shnapir won the pairs title. There is something about defending the title that brings out the worst in the American women. Since 1990, Kwan is the only other woman to win consecutive titles (granted, she did win eight in a row). Six women have won the last seven crowns, and the reigning champion has almost always had a total meltdown. Rachael Flatt is the only defending champ who even managed to stay on the podium the next year. ""I don't think anyone could have prepared me for how difficult this national championships was going to be,"" Wagner said. Wagner, though, is made of stern stuff. She's been rock solid since moving to California to train with John Nicks in the summer of 2011. She won the US title last year, had the best finish by an American at worlds since 2007 and won the silver medal last month in the Grand Prix final. And she sure looked loose as she came out from the dressing rooms, clapping along with the crowd to Zawadzki's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" music. Her opening triple flip-double toe loop-double toe combination was gorgeous, drawing oohs and aahs from the crowd. She also did a triple loop in and out of a spread eagle — incredibly difficult. But she didn't have her usual fire, almost as if she was skating not to lose rather than skating to win. ""I was feeling great that first half,"" Wagner said. ""Then I started to overthink it a little. She was off-balance in the air on a triple lutz, and couldn't right herself in time to save it. With a triple loop only seconds later, she didn't have time to regroup and she tumbled to the ice on that one, too. Wagner was subdued as she waited for her marks, surely thinking she'd blown her chance to repeat. At 21, though, Wagner is a far more complete skater than Gold, and that's what made the difference. Skating to ""Samson and Delilah,"" Wagner told a story while Gold just skated and jumped. When her score was announced and she saw she was still in first, a look of surprise crossed her face before she smiled. ""I was very uncertain as to what was going to happen, waiting for those scores to come up. I knew the program as whole, aside from the two mistakes, was very solid,"" Wagner said. ""It's definitely not the type of win, not the performance I had imagined myself having. But the fact I was able to repeat as champion with those two performances, that's something to be proud of."" With blonde good looks and a made-for-the Olympics name, Gold has all the makings of that ""next big thing"" the United States has been craving. That she can skate only fueled the hype, and some were ready to put her on the Sochi medals stand after she won the US junior title last year and finished second in the junior world championships. But she's been wildly inconsistent this year, winning the silver medal at Cup of Russia after falling apart at Skate Canada. After botching her short program Thursday, she needed a dazzling performance just to have a chance at one of the spots on the world championships team. She came through, posting a 132.49 that was the second-highest score for a free skate at nationals. Sasha Cohen scored 134.03 in 2006, the year she won her only US title. ""I stopped focusing on what was around me — the crowd, the screaming, the other skaters, the pressure, the expectations. I let it all go,"" Gold said. ""I just pictured myself at my rink in Chicago and even the practices here — how I would skate if I was practicing. Just the feel of the knees, the feel of the ice, one thing at a time. ""I didn't get over my head with thoughts or expectations. I just went out there and skated like I know how to skate."" Gold's jumps are fabulous, easily the best of the entire field. Maybe the whole world. They're done with power, and her combinations are so smooth she looks like a stone skipping across the water. She did seven triples, and even Kim Yu-na would be impressed with her triple lutz-triple toe loop combination. But skating is both sport and art, and Gold is going to have to add some substance between the jumps if she wants the prize to match her name. Her footwork was basic and most of her spins were adequate, and she didn't display that passion that makes a good program great. ""They pushed me,"" Gold said, looking at Wagner and Zawadzki. ""After that short program, I didn't want to compete. But I knew I had a lot of competitors and I had to push through.""",Raw Data

976,"﻿East All-Star Terrence Ross of the Toronto Raptors jumps over a boy as he competes in the slam dunk contest during the NBA basketball All-Star weekend in Houston, Texas, February 16, 2013. (REUTERS/Jeff Haynes) HOUSTON: Toronto Raptors guard Terrence Ross won the NBA’s Slam Dunk Contest with a one-handed, though-the-legs rim-rattler after leaping over a ballboy. The windmill slam earned the wild applause of the sold-out crowd at the Toyota Center Saturday and lifted the 22-year-old rookie to the title over Jeremy Evans of the Utah Jazz. “I feel blessed, but it’s still overwhelming,” he told reporters. “I’m just trying to soak it all in.” Ross garnered 58 percent of the votes from the public in the two-dunk championship round to claim the title. In another skills test, second-year guard Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated San Antonio Spurs power forward Matt Bonner 23-20 to win the 3-pointer shooting contest. Ross said he never dreamed he would win the title. “It was my favorite event to watch every year, since I was a small child,” he said. “But actually winning it, I never thought I’d do it. It’s been unbelievable. I’ve had fun.” In the opening round of the finals, Evans leaped over a covered easel and delivered a left-handed windmill slam. After the dunk, he pulled the cover off the easel and revealed a picture of himself dunking the ball. He then signed the picture to the roar of the crowd. But Ross clinched the competition with his gravity-defying leap over the ballboy, who also needed a leap of faith that he was not going to get clobbered. “I told him the day before that I was going to jump over him, but I never told him I was going to go through the legs,” Ross said. “He was kind of nervous. “When I first grabbed him he said, ‘You’re not going to hit me, right?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not going to hit you.’ So I had to calm his nerves.” In the 3-pointer contest, the 20-year-old Irving said he was using the occasion to become better known because the Cavaliers were generally out of the national spotlight. “This weekend was just basically about earning everybody’s respect and getting a chance to people to see me that don’t usually see me,” he said. “We’re not nationally televised. “This weekend is to get everybody acclimated to my face.”",Raw Data
977,"The Pistons have had some ups and downs this season, which is exactly what you expect from a young team still trying to find itself in terms of its rotation and minutes for people in the rotation. But let’s also not forget about the schedule. The schedule was murder, frankly, when you play one game against a team with a recently added sensational scorer – Houston and James Harden – and then take off for six out west. You better get lucky in a couple of games if you want to get a couple of wins and the Pistons were the opposite of lucky. They were unlucky more than once on that trip. Coming back winless looked much worse than it really was. I felt like the victory at Philadelphia showed what this team could do against a playoff-bound team. Their recent home-court winning streak has shown they can take advantage of their home floor and their fans and all the familiarity you get when you play at home. If you want to be a good team, you have to protect home court. If you want to be a very good to great team, you have to win on the road. The Pistons will learn how to do that well in the future. That future, by the way, looks much brighter and a big reason why is the addition of Andre Drummond and Kyle Singler. Their contributions have been beyond significant and I think they’re going to be able to contribute even more as we go along. When Andre changes the game – and it seems like he does more often than not with his work on the offensive glass and protecting the paint on the other end – it gives you a much better chance to win. You get more opportunities and the other guys end up being one and done. Then you add Kyle Singler to the mix. What can you say about Kyle? You shortchange him to a degree, but you can say this guy is an excellent complementary player. What does a complementary player do? He has to do everything and he has to fit in and he has to help you with your spacing offensively, with your execution, with your shot-making, and he has to help you with fundamentally sound defense. Kyle Singler does all of those things and he does them at a level – even this early in his career – above the average complementary player. I think this guy is going to be a very significant Piston for years to come. The Pistons clearly are an improved defensive team and for that I think you have to look hard at Jason Maxiell. The fact Lawrence Frank came in here made a world of difference to Jason. I think Lawrence took one look and knew he had a tiger up front in Jason Maxiell who would do all the dirty work and make spectacular plays and be an effort guy night in and night out. You start a guy like Jason Maxiell, he sets the tone defensively at the very least. But he’s gone way beyond that. He’s become the anchor of the defense. That guy, in his last three games going into our game with Golden State, has had 13 blocks. That’s better than four per – even I can do that math. And that’s not all he does. He puts bodies on people, he keeps guys away from the glass, he made Zach Randolph look ordinary and Zach is anything but. He’s the kind of guy who gives you everything he’s got, which includes some offense. He’s got a very nice touch when he lets that jumper go. He’s always in the heat of the battle, always doing something physically to help the Pistons get another possession, and yet when he gets the ball he can gather himself and show that silky-smooth shot of his. He’s a basketball player and he’s a starter in the NBA. You can thank Lawrence Frank for that, but Jason got an opportunity and he grabbed it and made the most of it. You add it all up and I think the Pistons are ready to take the next step. They will now start to play more consistent basketball. You expect inconsistency with a young team. You expect inconsistency with a team still trying to get totally familiar with its rotation, with its system and all of that. But they now know they’re good enough to play with most everybody in this league and now they have to start winning some games on the road. If you play well on the road, you’re still not going to win maybe more than half of ’em unless you’re a championship-caliber team, but you’ll win your share. That’s what I think the Pistons will start to do. You’ll see more consistency as this team evolves over the next couple of months and I think they’ll end up right where we thought – fighting for a playoff spot. If they make it, great. If they miss it by an eyelash, it’s still going to be exciting and it still shows the kind of potential they have for the future. Related Articles: George Blaha True Blue Pistons",Raw Data
978,"The NHL appears headed toward a 48-game season for the second time in two decades. HOCKEY IS BACK! Engel: NHL is back. Does anyone care? NHL, union agree on tentative deal NHL leaning toward 48-game season Horrow: What hurdles remain? Happy players react on Twitter Key details in deal | Lockout timeline ''I think 48 is most likely at this point, unless the players can expedite their ratification process,'' NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly wrote in an email Monday to The Associated Press. The NHL shortened its 82-game slate to 48 games for the 1994-95 season after a 103-day lockout. A 301-day lockout in 2004-05 made the NHL the first major North American professional sports league to lose an entire season. When the framework of a new collective bargaining agreement was agreed to Sunday morning - after 16 hours of negotiations - there was some talk of having a 50-game season start later this month. The NHL and the players' association are working on a memorandum of understanding, which could be completed soon, then voted on by owners and players. The league has circulated a memo to teams telling them to be ready to play by Jan. 19, the date the shortened season is expected to start. ''As we prepare for the season opener, I want to apologize to all Blues fans, especially our season ticket holders, suite holders, and sponsors,'' St. Louis Blues owner Tom Stillman said in a statement released by the team. ''We share in your disappointment and frustration about the lockout.'' Los Angeles Kings forward Kevin Westgarth, who was part of the union negotiating team for much of the long work stoppage, expects the NHLPA to conduct a conference call to explain and answer questions about the new CBA before players vote on it online. ''Of course the league will say if the players hurry up, we can play more games, but there's a reality to consider as well,'' Westgarth said in a telephone interview Monday from Raleigh, N.C., where he skated informally with some Carolina Hurricanes. ''But the first step is for the people who are good with words to get on paper what both sides agreed to. ''Then, we have to get guys - who are scattered all over the world - to understand the agreement before we can start voting.'' Some NHL players - including Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin - went overseas during the lockout. Ovechkin, who played for his hometown Dynamo Moscow in the Kontinental Hockey League, was welcomed back to Washington by the Capitals, who posted a picture of him on their Twitter account arriving at a local airport. Players - teammates and opponents - who stayed in North America have been getting together for months to skate, conduct on-ice drills and work out on their own to stay in relatively good shape. Penguins star Sidney Crosby and nearly a dozen teammates worked out at a suburban Pittsburgh ice rink Monday. For a change, Crosby and the rest of the NHL players knew games will be played after negotiators for both sides - and an outside mediator - found a way to revive a sport desperate to regain momentum and boost its prominence. The league and the union agreed to the framework of a 10-year labor contract, ending a bitter dispute that wiped out a large part of the hockey season for the third time in less than two decades. On the 113th day of the lockout and five days before the league's deadline for a deal, the bleary-eyed sides held a 6 a.m. Sunday news conference to announce there would be a season after all. The lockout could wipe out perhaps $1 billion in revenue this season because about 40 percent of the regular-season schedule won't be played. The NHL's revenue of $3.3 billion last season lagged well behind the NFL ($9 billion), Major League Baseball ($7.5 billion) and the NBA ($5 billion). The new deal will lower the players' percentage from 57 to 50 after owners originally had proposed the players get 46 percent. This was the third lockout among the major U.S. sports in a period of just over a year. A four-month NFL lockout ended in July 2011 with the loss of only one exhibition game, and an NBA lockout caused each team's schedule to be cut from 82 games to 66 last season.",Raw Data
979,"Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. Alex Gallardo-Associated Press Check out the Laker Girls gallery and more. VIEW GALLERY» LOS ANGELES – ""Winning is fun,"" said Pau Gasol after the Los Angeles Lakers beat Oklahoma City 105-96 Sunday afternoon at Staples Center. The Lakers (19-25) had a lot of fun against the 34-11 Thunder. Even though it seems like things are upside-down in Lakerland with Gasol — a four-time All Star — now a reserve, Steve Nash looking more like a shooting guard than a point guard, and Kobe Bryant gobbling up assists, everything is finally going well for LA. The Lakers held the highest-scoring team in the league to 10 points under its season average, and were able to shut down virtually every comeback attempt by OKC. The norm for this season was LA gets a lead, blows the lead quickly and goes on to lose – again. The last two games — including a win over Utah on Friday night — showed a different Lakers team, one that plays hard and sacrifices for the good of the team, not the luster of the stat sheet. ""We're talking, our rotations are there and we're getting after it defensively,"" said Dwight Howard, who had eight points and 10 rebounds in 29 minutes on the court. ""We're also doing a good job of not turning the ball over, which was leading to a lot of fast breaks, which is why teams were beating us."" Kobe Bryant, who nearly registered a triple-double with 21 points, 14 assists and nine rebounds, agreed with his center's evaluation of the turnaround, but added that the Lakers have finally figured out their real identity as a team. ""I think we're doing a great job of being real with each other, holding each other accountable,"" Bryant said. ""And I think we've figured out who we are. We're a team that is posting the ball up a lot, we're running deep screen-rolls, and overall we're very active. ""Beating a team like Oklahoma City helps the overall process."" Thunder coach Scott Brooks wasn't concerned with the Lakers' turnaround since their last meeting 16 days ago, a game that OKC won by 15. He was disappointed in the way his team performed down the stretch with the game on the line. ""The end of the game execution by our team . . . could have been better,"" he said. ""Definitely could have been better and it's something that we're usually pretty good at. ""They just beat us. I don't know if they're different, they just beat us. They played better than us and deserved to win."" Lakers forward Metta World Peace was philosophical about the victory. ""When we were losing games earlier, we were getting beat by better teams,"" said World Peace, who had 15 points, 10 rebounds and played phenomenal defense all over the court. ""It ‘s simple as that. We weren't good enough to beat them; (today) we were. There's no reason to even talk about the past. We just have to keep playing like we did today."" Something Howard feels his team will continue to do. ""We've found some things to make us better team,"" Howard said, ""but we have to stay humble, stay focused and just win games. Keep it going."" So why did it take so long to figure things out? ""I don't know,"" he said. ""But we're happy with our progress, we're going to continue to work together and talk to each other. We're also doing much better holding each other accountable for everything we do on the floor. We're not afraid to speak up and say what we have to say. That (everybody) and we just have to continue to do that."" With the win, the Lakers are four games out of the final playoff spot in the Western Conference. Bryant says the move into the playoffs is easy if the Lakers do one thing. ""We have to do whatever we need to do to win the game we're playing,"" Bryant said. ""If we do that, everything will be fine."" Sounds simple, but it hasn't been so far in one of the most tumultuous seasons in franchise history. THREE THOUGHTS 1. Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak is telling reporters that he doesn't have any plans to make a move as the Feb. 21 trading deadline approaches. Even though the Lakers have looked markedly better in their last two games, it's obvious that they need an athletic, defensive-minded player on their team. Earl Clark fills the bill against bigger players, but I'll bet Kupchak wishes he hadn't let Matt Barnes walk to the Clippers after last season. Even Bryant has said a tough, agitating player like Barnes would make a big difference in the Lakers' season. 2. Sitting next to each other at courtside were Dodgers outfielder Matt Kemp and former Laker Derek Fisher. Kemp, an Oklahoma native, is a frequent attendee of Lakers games when he's in LA. (He makes his offseason home in Arizona.) For Fisher, it was his first game as a spectator at Staples Center after asking the Dallas Mavericks to release him for ""personal reasons."" Since he makes his home in Los Angeles, Fisher could probably be brought back to the Lakers at a minimal salary. If Mike D'Antoni is serious about slowing down the offense, Fisher could be a valuable addition for 8-10 minutes a game. And he could be instrumental in cooling off any locker-room tension that may be taking place — or will take place in the future. 3. The Lakers' two best players have a tendency to lose their cool on occasion — which could come back to bite them later in the season. Kobe has eight technical fouls this season — second behind Matt Barnes and Blake Griffin of the Clippers along with DeMarcus Cousins of Sacramento, each of whom have nine. Howard has five flagrant fouls marked against his record; one more and he is suspended for a game. Bryant still is eight T's away from a suspension, but there's plenty of time left.",Raw Data

981,"﻿After losing four of the last five games of the 2012 regular season, the Baltimore Ravens now have won three straight playoff games, including two in a row on the road over Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. En route to New Orleans and a date with the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII, they’ve silenced critics, done the unthinkable and slayed two of the greatest quarterbacks of football’s modern era. “I don’t know with all the different events and challenges that we have had this season whether we are a team of destiny, but I will say we are a team of vision,” says Brigance, a former Ravens player and the team’s current senior adviser to player development. “We have faith in the vision we have all seen to be Super Bowl champions.” Known around the Ravens locker room and team’s facility as “Juice,” Brigance knows a thing or two about having faith in a vision. In 2007, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. First he lost the use of his arms. Then he lost his ability to walk. Then, his ability to talk. Through it all, though, he’s never lost the ability to inspire and lead. Bound to a wheelchair and unable to use his voice, he reports to work every day with an upbeat demeanor and the unbreakable confidence in a personal goal. “I believe, despite my diagnosis, that I will walk again,” he tells me. When I met with Brigance, 43, on Thursday afternoon at the Ravens team facility, he was in the midst of just another day at the only work address he’s known since joining the Ravens as an executive in 2004. A step inside his office at 1 Winning Drive is a step into a world of promise and positive energy. Blessed with a smile that could keep even the darkest of times light, Brigance communicates through a high-tech computer device called a DynaVox machine. Mounted on to his wheelchair, the machine produces a wide range of speech generating devices, allowing Brigance to use eye-targeted movements to speak through a computerized voice. Using his eyes as cues for a database full of messages and potential responses, Brigance has the ability to touch others with his words. He can share his positive outlook. He can live his life. Living this life was at one point considered a nearly impossible dream for Brigance. His wife, Chanda, says that when O.J. was first diagnosed with ALS, they were told he had three to five years to live. Well, it’s been five years since that fateful day, and not only is O.J. Brigance still alive, but he’s still hard at work, doing what he loves. He’s also serving as a major source of inspiration for the Super Bowl-bound 2012 Ravens. “Every day I came out and told O.J. that you’re my greatest motivation,” linebacker Ray Lewis said after Sunday’s AFC Championship Game victory. “What can’t you say about O.J.?” saftey Ed Reed said shortly after Brigance addressed the team via his DynaVox machine in the locker room Sunday night. “O’J.’s been our strength. O.J. took me under his wing when I first got here, and everything he’s been through and is going through, to still be the same O.J. and being a light to you and be a light for our team. ... He’s been like an uncle to me and like a brother. I love Juice.” Brigance heard those comments earlier in the week. He smiles when I mention them. “Those men inspire me,” he says. “They have helped give me a reason to get up and out of the bed every morning. There is a biblical proverb that says, ‘As Iron sharpens Iron, so does one man sharpen another.’ We are making each other better men.” Long before Lewis hoisted the Lombardi Trophy after Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, Brigance brought a professional football championship trophy back to the city of Baltimore. A star linebacker on the short-lived Baltimore Stallions Canadian Football League team in the early '90s, Brigance hoisted the Grey Cup with his Stallions teammates in 1995. He was an All-Pro and the city’s face of professional football, a somewhat unlikely bridge between the Colts glory days of Johnny U and the modern day Ravens teams led by Lewis. After being picked up by the Dolphins and spending four years as a linebacker in Miami, he signed with the Ravens prior to the start of the 2000 season. The captain of the special-teams unit, he was a leader in the locker room for the first Ravens Super Bowl team. Today, though unable to use his extremities or have his voice heard, he still is that same leader of men that he was when Baltimore played for its Lombardi Trophy. He insists that it’s the men in this Ravens locker room, however, who’ve served as his motivation in the fight against ALS. “This Ravens Super Bowl run has shown me that if you continue to strive for one unified goal with one unified soul, you can accomplish great feats,” he says. “There will always be critics who’ll try to deflate your dreams. As Bishop (T.D.) Jakes always says, ‘Don’t view them as haters. View them as stimulators.’ ” Brigance certainly is living his life to the fullest these days. Every morning, his nurse picks him up in nearby Reisterstown, They drive in a van to the facility in Owings Mills, and he reports to work. Through his words and his presence, he’s made an indelible impact on this Ravens team. Through his work within the ALS community, he’s made an even greater difference outside of the football world. His Brigance Brigade organization has been an instrumental player in advancing ALS research and fundraising efforts. Its mission is to “equip, encourage, and empower people living with ALS (PALS) to live their lives.” “My message to my fellow (PALS) is that life was never promised to be easy,” Brigance said. “Certain assignments have been pleasant, and others have been challenging. Jesus said, ‘In this world, you will have tribulation. But behold, I have overcome the world.’ ” He continues, “Would I have chosen ALS? No. However, I have been given the opportunity to do my life’s greatest work because I have chosen to fight and impact my circle of influence for God’s greater good despite my circumstances. We all have a circle of influence that we can impact no matter what the circumstances in our respective lives.” Brigance’s circle of influence gets larger every day. As his story grows from a regional to a national one with every passing week, ALS awareness and fundraising efforts increase. He’s leading the charge in fighting a disease that impacts over 30,000 American families. As we wrap up our afternoon in Baltimore, Brigance brings the conversation full-circle, linking his current battle with the one the Ravens have in two Sundays. KAEPERNICKING? 49ers QB's touchdown celebration has taken off taken off on social media. “Without faith, no great accomplishment is possible,'' he says. ""I believe despite my diagnosis, I will walk again. And this team believes no adverse circumstance will stop them from achieving their goal of being world champions in football and life.” Brigance then takes a moment, and adds, “We have been the underdogs the last two weeks, and everything has worked out pretty well. We don’t want the favor of Las Vegas. We want the favor of God. We like His odds.” There will be plenty of different Super Bowl personalities and storylines dissected and profiled in the coming days. But the true heart of the Baltimore Ravens — the one who won a championship in this city long before there even was a Ravens franchise — is O.J. Brigance. He’s the guiding light for a very special team of vision.",Raw Data
982,"Humbled a year ago when both its cars failed to make the podium, Chip Ganassi Racing returned to the Rolex 24 at Daytona determined to pick up another victory watch. RACE OF CHAMPIONS See the best photos from the Rolex 24 at Daytona. An eyebrow-raising lineup change that involved Juan Pablo Montoya showed just how serious the team was about winning, and it delivered Sunday with its fifth win in 10 appearances in the prestigious sports car race. The victory was the fifth for lead driver Scott Pruett, tying Hurley Haywood's record for wins in the twice-around-the-clock race at Daytona International Speedway. ''Having gotten to know Hurley real well over the years by racing with him and just as a friend, and to have him there at the end was pretty special,'' Pruett said. The winning team of three-time defending Grand-Am drivers Pruett and Memo Rojas, along with Montoya and IndyCar driver Charlie Kimball, making his Rolex debut, beat the Max Angelelli-led VelocityWW team by almost 22 seconds. It was Montoya who closed out the win, driving the final stint and waging a strong battle in the final hour with defending champion AJ Allmendinger. Ganassi's No. 01 BMW Riley had a clear horsepower advantage, and once Montoya got past Allmendinger, the win was his for the taking. But the Ganassi team figured it was four laps short on fuel, and Montoya needed to build a lead of at least 40 seconds to hold off Angelelli and Allmendinger when he was forced to stop for gas. The Colombian did it by turning laps close to qualifying pace, and breezed to his third Rolex victory. ''It was a lot of pressure; I thought we have a decent lead, we're just going to go out there and ride for two and a half hours,'' Montoya said. ''And then you realize there's a caution and another caution and another caution, and with the way the rules are and the speed the car had, it's like you didn't want to get into a ... contest with anybody. You had to be smart about when you passed them. ''We were kind of concerned about the (Shank) car, what they were going to do with fuel because they told me they could make it until the end and that we were going to have to push, and we pushed like crazy and opened up a hell of a gap. It was fun.'' Mark your calendars now and get ready to ""reach up and pull those belts down tight one more time!"" the Subway Fresh Fit 500 on FOX is set for 2:30 p.m. ET on Sunday.",Raw Data

The team said Tuesday that Catchings and starting guards Briann January Shavonte Zellous have all signed multi-year contracts to stay with the team. Terms were not released. Catchings was the league MVP in 2011, the WNBA Finals MVP Award last season and owns three Olympic gold medals. She led the Fever with averages of 17.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.0 steals last season. Fever president Kelly Krauskopf says she wants the 13-year veteran to finish her career in Indiana.

984,"December 13, 2012 -- Maya Moore has excelled everywhere she's played, winning championships from college to the WNBA and Europe. Now she's leaving her mark on the Chinese women's basketball league. Averaging 45 points a game for the Shanxi Flame, Moore has helped bring new fans to the women's game in a basketball crazed nation. ""They show maybe five NBA games a week here,"" Moore told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ""They get a good amount of coverage and people love it. We are starting to get a little more interest about our game."" The NBA long has seen China as a place for huge growth. Maya Moore is averaging 45 points per game in China. It was evident at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 with the basketball games sold out and the contest between the U.S. men and China having nearly 100 million viewers. With Europe still feeling the effects of the financial downturn, China's competitive salaries and shorter season have made it one of the top destinations for the world's elite women basketball players. The former UConn star is earning mid-six figures, which is on a par with European salaries. While most European leagues go from October to May, China only plays till February. This will give Moore time to rest before the Minnesota Lynx open training camp in May. It also will provide the young face of women's basketball the opportunity to participate at the NBA All-Star Game in February and be around for the women's Final Four. Besides Moore, the talent is improving throughout the league. Tamika Catchings, Elizabeth Cambage, Sophia Young and Jayne Appel are all playing this year. Swin Cash has played there in the past. ""I think it's been a good introduction for a lot of the fans seeing some of the Olympic level women over here,"" Moore said. ""To see the talent it's been I think very surprising thing for the fans. Interest will continue to spark more of a demand for players and the basketball level will rise. This area of the world will continue to want basketball even more, elevating that market."" The WNBA has taken notice of the recent boom in China. ""We know the sport of basketball is on the rise in China and the WNBA has already had great success on the international stage,"" WNBA president Laurel Ritchie said. ""I am really encouraged that there are now many more millions of people around the globe -- including China -- who know what the WNBA is all about. We've exposed more people to the game, to the players, to the story both on and off the court ... and this will only help grow our league both domestically and abroad."" I speak English, one of my teammates is Korean. That's two languages. Two of our coaches are Spanish -- one is the Spanish national team head coach. The first couple days I was there my head was spinning. -- Maya Moore While Moore has definitely brought interest with her play, Catchings has tried to mentor her teammates. ""I think my approach is probably different then the approach of some of the younger players,"" Catchings said in an email to The Associated Press. ""I feel like my job is to teach my teammates how I play and how to have fun doing it."" It didn't take long for Moore to endear herself to her new team. Moore, the first woman basketball player to be signed by the Jordan brand, gave a pair of yellow and red sneakers to each of her teammates. Then she started playing and the team only has lost once since. Moore introduced herself to the Chinese fans almost immediately with a 60-point performance in her third game, which just happened to be nationally televised. ""The game was against one of the army teams,"" Moore said. ""They don't have a foreigner and they are very prideful. The first quarter I was in a zone feeling good. I hit seven 3's in the first quarter. It gave me a jump start on the 60."" Moore was hard-pressed to remember ever scoring close to that before. She had 48 in high school and 48 was her college best. Connecticut and Olympic coach Geno Auriemma wasn't surprised by his former star's success. ""Maya is Maya,"" he said. ""Her scoring that many points isn't a real shock. She can really do whatever she wants."" Basketball has been the easy part for Moore since coming over to China. Communicating with teammates has taken a little more work with up to four languages being spoken in team huddles. ""It's pretty comical,"" Moore said laughing. ""I speak English, one of my teammates is Korean. That's two languages. Two of our coaches are Spanish -- one is the Spanish national team head coach. The first couple days I was there my head was spinning."" On the court, there don't seem to be many communication issues. The team uses hand signals, numbers, and Moore said she learned some basic words to get through. ""I'm getting better, I know about 10 words so far, I'm learning new ones every day,"" she said. Moore also has a personal assistant assigned by the team to help her with basics like grocery shopping and getting around. ""I think the success to your playing overseas really relies heavily on your translator and how well the team is able to help you adjust to them and being in a foreign country,"" said Catchings, who also has spent time playing in Korea. ""It's definitely an adjustment. Your team and the organization becomes your family while you are over here."" Moore, who played in Spain last winter, also has had the benefit of having her mom with her. She came over in October and has spent most of the first two months in China, including Thanksgiving. The two have been put up in a ""western-style"" hotel for the four-month season. ""It's really been great having her around and she'll be here for Christmas,"" Moore said. ""She's experiencing China herself."" Among the things Moore has learned to appreciate while being in China are some of the freedom she has in the U.S. ""It's kind of hard not having unrestricted Internet,"" she said. ""There's certain things you can't view. Certain liberties you don't have. YouTube, Twitter, things like that. There are certain social medial sites. You're so used to having access to whatever we need. It's different that way.""",Raw Data
985,"It took the Los Angeles Lakers only five games this season to get rid of head coach Mike Brown, so maybe Mike DAntoni can point to this as one of his few accomplishments since taking over the job: He made it more than twice as far before it became time to wonder if the same fate should await him. LATEST ON LAKERS Kobe scores 42 in comeback win Why is Dwight texting with Phil? Gilman: Time running out on Lakers Buss' health factor in Brown firing Schedule | Stats | Team page If that sounds like crazy talk, well, so does the fact that the Lakers are 4-8 under DAntoni, 9-13 overall, 12th in the Western Conference and on Tuesday night were manhandled by a Cleveland Cavaliers team that entered the game with just four wins. Theres also the fact it would be absurd to pay three coaches Mike Brown and, if he were fired, DAntoni and presumably Phil Jackson for the same season. The question is whether it would be more absurd to miss the playoffs with a team featuring Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard, to say nothing of the now-injured Pau Gasol and Steve Nash. This Lakers team is built around the same concept that defined the Heat during the Big Threes inaugural season win a championship or fail, and no excuses will do. Not injuries, not Nashs absence, not time needed to adjust to a new system, not the fact Howard and Kobe still are figuring out how to play together, not the fact patience is preferred to panic. Those things did not save Brown. They wont save DAntoni either. Theres also a short window thats closing here for the kind of greatness the Lakers faithful and bosses planned for. Nash is 38, Bryant 34, Gasol 32. As the pressure mounts, most of it will point, fairly or otherwise, toward DAntoni and his abysmal beginning to this much-hyped season. Somewhere Mike Brown knows what Im talking about. Magic Johnson knows, too, so much so he voiced his displeasure this week. Kobe Bryant knows, which may be why in a long interview with ESPN on Wednesday, he gave a defense of DAntonis ability to be flexible with his up-tempo system that sounded a lot like a Phil Jackson-style psychological shot at that very thing. FAN ROYALTY Celebrities at NBA games are in the crowd, not on the court. He wants to be successful more than anything, Bryant said. Its not just about implementing his system as the end goal. The end goal is to win a championship. Its not playing a certain way. As with Brown before him, the most damning evidence staring at DAntoni, the Lakers brass and the legion of purple-and-gold fans is recent history. For Brown, that was the winless preseason and the end of last season with the Lakers. For DAntoni, its these first 12 games with the Lakers and his three-plus years with their next opponent, the New York Knicks. The Knicks this season have been defined by Carmelo Anthony, who after helping force out DAntoni last March has made his team into a winner. The Lakers, since Browns exit, have been defined by DAntoni, who landed in Los Angeles and just kept on losing. The Knicks were 121-167 under D'Antoni, including 18-24 last season despite the Linsanity phenomenon. Mike Woodson, who took over after DAntoni resigned in March, has minted a 34-11 regular-season record, including a 16-5 mark so far this season that has the Knicks atop the Eastern Conference going into Thursday night's matchup with the Lakers at Madison Square Garden. Theres no doubting that DAntoni has succeeded with his system in the past. He could have won an NBA Finals during his Phoenix days, he helped spur Steve Nash to two MVP awards and he established himself as one of the games best offensive coaches. WHO SETS THE CURVE?

Its also true that DAntoni left the Knicks in better shape then he found them poised, if nothing else, for a turnaround at another coachs hand and that he has enjoyed absolutely no honeymoon period in L.A. because most Lakers fans, hoping for the return of Jackson, weren't happy with his arrival to begin with. But thats life in one of the biggest and flashiest of cities. Thats the deal. What DAntoni is finding is that Hollywood and the Big Apple play by different rules than other cities. In LA and NYC, you are a star or a failure; a prodigy or a washout; a commodity or a burden. There is no middle ground, not in those places, not with those teams, not in 2012. Right now DAntoni is a failure; hes washed up, a burden. And his hope for changing that rests in a 38-year-old point guard salvaging the Lakers season. Remarkable reversals of fortune are also hallmarks of L.A. and New York, but thats a lot riding on Nash. What if it doesnt work? What if Nash, a nice piece but not the savior most thought Howard to be, cant turn around a team thats too slow, porous on defense, lethargic on offense and hearing about its shortcomings from Lakers luminaries such as Kobe and Magic? THE RIGHT MOVES See how NBA dance teams get crowds all fired up. What if DAntonis system wont work because Nash cant replicate his younger days in Phoenix? What if Gasol and Howard thrive in the low post rather than setting screens in the pick-and-roll? What if the old, slow Lakers belong in a half-court offense instead of D'Antoni's ""seven seconds or less"" system against younger, more athletic teams? What if Kobe God help the Lakers cools off?! What then? Well, then maybe what DAntoni told a reporter a few weeks ago would really be true: He should never have left Phoenix in the first place.",Raw Data

Hockey and I are old friends. I grew up in Chicago, right now the hottest town on ice. I also lived in Detroit, the self-named ""Hockeytown, USA."" I now reside in Los Angeles, current home of the game's Stanley Cup. (That's the trophy that goes to the championship team, for those of you who wouldn't know a Stanley Cup from a sippy cup.) The Chicago Blackhawks have been in the news. Why? Well, that's a good question. Because they win a lot? Uh, kind of. Because they don't lose? Er, technically, no. I will try to explain it if you've got a couple of minutes to kill. (Which is also a hockey thing ... killing a couple of minutes while a guy's in a penalty box.) Chicago's record is 21-0. That's how it looks in the National Hockey League's standings, at least. W 21, L 0. Are the Blackhawks unbeaten? Um, no. Bleacher Report: Top 25 all-time Chicago Blackhawks Mike Downey It's a little complicated. A hockey game no longer can end in a tie. It uses an overtime period to break a tie. If that doesn't work, a ""shootout"" is held, similar to soccer's. One-on-one vs. a goaltender until someone wins. As a reward for extending a game to overtime, a team is given a bonus point by the NHL. So, even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the Blackhawks have -- you didn't ""lose."" Already knew that?

If you are into pucks, you might be aware that the Blackhawks put together a pretty cool 30-game streak over a span of two seasons without being defeated in three 20-minute periods. Chicago is aware. Chicago's on fire. The team is the talk of the town. Cubs, schmubs. On national TV's sports news, the two smokin'-hot teams have been basketball's Miami Heat (beating almost everybody they play) and hockey's Blackhawks (kinda sorta technically not losing to anybody they play). I suppose you have heard of Miami's basketball star. His name is LeBron James. He grew up in Ohio, where he never once wanted to grow up to be a Blue Jacket. But he did tweet that the Blackhawks are AWESOME. I do not know if you know who Chicago's hockey stars are. One of them is Jonathan Toews, which is pronounced ""Taves,"" not toes, not tweeze. He went to the University of North Dakota, as most great athletes do. (OK, maybe not ""most."") Another one is Marian Hossa, which is pronounced ""Ho Sa,"" not hoss sa, not hah sa. He is from Stara Lubovna, Slovakia, where everybody probably watches him on CNN with no clue who LeBron James is. A definite one is Patrick Kane, as in Citizen. He was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, where a boy is so lucky because he can play ice hockey outdoors 10 to 11 months a year. Bleacher Report: Why the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks will go down as one of the best teams ever Together with some sharp teammates, not the least of whom is Patrick Sharp, these guys have got Chicago rocking and rolling. From the time tenor Jim Cornelison operatically belts out our national anthem (or Canada's) to the times they pump up the volume to ""Chelsea Dagger"" by the Fratellis to celebrate a Blackhawk goal, a home game at the United Center is usually loud, usually SRO and usually bigger than Bieber and Beyonce rolled into one. If I exaggerate, sue me. I checked with Jay Blunk to find out just how big things there are. Jay is the team's executive vice president ""We've been very fortunate to experience unprecedented television ratings,"" he told me Wednesday. ""Merchandise sales have accelerated. The NHL announced that Jonathan Toews' jersey sales were the number one-selling jersey in the country for the month of February. We also just passed the 200 consecutive-game sellout mark. Tickets have become some of the hottest regular season tickets in history."" If he exaggerates -- and I doubt it -- don't sue me. I'm enjoying this too much. You see, it wasn't so long ago my boyhood favorites the Blackhawks were skating on (insert ""thin ice"" cliche here). They looked as dead in the water as a cruise ship. A great organization had become disorganized. A popular team to watch had disappeared off the radar. A team born in 1926 had turned into the Walking Dead (on skates). Chicagoans lost interest. They had Ditka's Da Bears, followed by Jordan's Da Bulls, followed by a 2003 Cubs team that could have won the World Series and a 2005 White Sox team that did. I moved back there in 2003. The bad Blackhawk team of 2003-04 played in 74 games and won 20. ESPN the Magazine ranked it 119th of 120 franchises in all of sports, in terms of ownership, fan relations, players, coaching, intangibles such as ""bang for your buck,"" ahead of only the Houston Texans, a new pro football team with zero dark history. Home games weren't even shown on TV. On the nightly news, sportscasters gave time to highlights from games of the Chicago Wolves, a minor-league team, almost as much as they did the Blackhawks. Hey, if I liked minor-league hockey, I'd live in Rockford. I seldom saw anybody in a Blackhawk jersey go out in public anymore, except maybe Mike Myers from ""Wayne's World."" The 2004-05 season didn't happen. A union war broke out, and the NHL's whole season was wiped out. Chicago basically yawned. The Blackhawks hadn't won a Stanley Cup since 1961. That was their first since 1938. Bleacher Report: How will history view this team? I was a hockey guy. I wasn't just familiar with old-time hockey names such as Bobby Hull. I knew Kenny Wharram and Ab McDonald and ""Moose"" Vasko and Bill Hay. I thought of them as other Chicago sports fans might think of a Dick Butkus or an Ernie Banks. So you can see, almost as exciting as winning 2010's Stanley Cup was, why the 2013 superstart of the Blackhawks is a sight to behold. Los Angeles finally cracked the ice ceiling in 2012 with the Kings' first championship, which was a pleasure to watch. I have a daughter who recently asked whether I could get her hockey tickets. She didn't want One Direction or Lady Gaga. She wanted Kings versus Red Wings. I was so proud. Hockey isn't for everybody. It's just for us cool people.",Raw Data
987,"Who is your Premier League manager of the season? Roberto Mancini if Man City win the league? Brendan Rodgers for Swansea's style and substance? Paul Lambert for surpassing expectations at Norwich? Each of those have a claim (and Sir Alex Ferguson is never far away in these things) but realistically there is a clear winner in my view - honorary Geordie Alan Pardew. In Toon: Pardew and Cisse proved too hot for Chelsea to handle Regardless of whether Newcastle finish in the top four or not, what he has achieved on Tyneside this season is staggering. Wednesday night's win over Chelsea symbolised everything about the Newcastle side he's developed. They were tremendously well organised, showed fantastic battling qualities and team spirit, and demonstrated wonderful flair going forward. I don't mind saying that at the start of the season I thought Newcastle would end up getting relegated. Many fans saw Pardew as a nodding dog for the unpopular owners. But he's turned out to be anything but. Jeff Stelling Quotes of the week Sky Sports Fantasy Football Play Fantasy Football against Jeff Stelling each win for the chance to win great prizes. Pick your team. Play Super 6 Think you know your football? Predict the scores for six matches for the chance to win 100,000. It's free to play and you could land the jackpot. Play now I remember that when Pardew first went to Newcastle (and by the way I thought Chris Hughton was treated incredibly unfairly) a lot of the fans' websites were incredibly negative about his appointment; many saw him as a nodding dog for the unpopular owners. But he's turned out to be anything but and the tone on those same websites has changed. I read one tongue-in-cheek comment this week which said 'I dinna know who this man thinks he is. He's come in here, improved our team, improved our style of play, improved our league position...' They've certainly claimed some decent scalps long the way - beating Man Utd 3-0, Liverpool2-0, Chelsea 2-0. In footballing terms Pardew's results speak for themselves. Everywhere he's been, his percentage win-rate stands out: Southampton(53), Reading (48), Newcastle (43), West Ham (41). Only his time at Charlton (31) could be perceived as relatively disappointing. Transformed Pardew is meticulous in everything he does but in the week that Roy Hodgson was appointed England boss, I couldn't help reflecting that he isn't the style of person who would necessarily go down well at the FA. He is quite outspoken at times and I don't feel he is one who would necessarily toe the line, when it is necessary to do so, and there is a touch of arrogance in his manner that helps set him apart from some of his peers and gets the best out of players. Take Fabricio Coloccini, for example, who appears a player transformed. Pardew has got him playing to his strengths and that's mirrored throughout the side; there are no square pegs in round holes. People know what their job is; they know what they are meant to be doing and work tremendously hard for their boss. Then there are players who have come into the side like James Perch, who many thought of as extremely ordinary, who has had such an incredible impact that suddenly the fans are calling him 'Perchinio'! Inspiration Up front Newcastle have been a revelation. In the first half of the season Demba Bacaught the eye, now it's all about Papiss Cisse - even though I actually think Ba is still playing pretty well. Both of Cisse's strikes against Chelsea were wonder goals, for me. The second one is the more spectacular but the first was absolutely breath-taking. He's performed at that level since he arrived at the club following another great piece of talent spotting. Not bad for 9m! He looks as though he's worth twice, three times that amount. Cheik Ismael Tiote has been incredible too, while Hatem Ben Arfa - the 'enfant terrible' of French football - looks like a player rehabilitated. He hasn't put a foot wrong for Newcastle and has become an integral part of the side. Every time Newcastle lose and lose badly - the defeats to Fulham, Tottenham and Wigan spring to mind - there has been a temptation to say 'that's it, the bubble has finally burst' but it never has. That fantastic achievement is down to the dedication and inspiration of the management and the coaching staff. Generally speaking - aside from notable absentees like Steven Taylor - they've been fairly fortunate with injuries which has meant that Pardew has been able to play a similar team for much of the season. Perhaps Pardew's biggest achievement is that nobody seems to be talking about Mike Ashley anymore! I imagine the owner is absolutely delighted because Pardew has taken all of the pressure of him. Of course, Newcastle can still have a massive impact on the destiny of the Premier League title. If Manchester City win at Newcastle on Sunday then they will deserve to be champions, because as United found out, it's a hell of a tough place to go and get a result. With 50,000-odd Geordies there it is going to be one fantastic afternoon and, to be honest, I wouldn't want to predict which way it will go!",Raw Data
988,"There is, of course, much to admire about the football media in this country. There's the creative chutzpah of the transfer rumour business, a heady cavalcade of rare truth, occasional half-truth, and frequent, badly-concealed nonsense. There's the cojones it takes to attach the word EXCLUSIVE to stories so worn that Jeffrey Archer would blush. There's the inspirational patriotism that fuels England's triumphalist march to international tournaments, and the inspirational patriotism that fuels the righteous crusade against whichever hapless foreigner was at fault in the quarter-final. Then, of course, there's the televisual analysis. Whether it's the no-nonsense narrative style of Alan Shearer - ""See the ball. See the man kick the ball. See the ball go in the goal"" - the light-hearted quippery of Mark ""Lawro"" Lawrenson, or the obscene trouser topography of Jamie Redknapp, England's pundits are second-to-none in their professionalism, their insight, and their devotion to their jobs. The latest addition to this proud lineage is Gary Neville, who finally earned his spurs this weekend after turning his educated and analytical eye toward David de Gea, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur's late equaliser. There can be no doubt that David de Gea, in general terms, is a failure. Since joining United, he has overtly and blatantly failed to be either Peter Schmeichel or Edwin van der Sar. He has failed to demonstrate the nous of a 35-year-old veteran, completely lacked the physical presence of a significantly larger man, and shown no trace of having been raised in a footballing culture that holds crosses in almost as high regard as the mistrust of foreigners. All this has been exacerbated by his habit of rotating and injuring the defenders in front of him, and his refusal to instantly turn into a significantly better player. It's no wonder that this season has been marked by risible errors, including the hilarious fumble against Sunderland, when he ushered Adam Johnson's speculative and feeble shot into the net at the near post. (That was him, wasn't it?) Entertainingly for us all, this litany of failure has come while playing for Manchester United, which means he's on the television a lot. This, in turn, makes him a prime target for one of the proudest and most glorious traditions of English football analysis: the ancient and noble art of looking at people's faces and talking about what they look like. The great strength of such phizognology is its flexibility. Where fussier schools of thought might require conclusions based on firm ground, or some kind of logical derivation, coupon-scrivening revels in its idiosyncrasy. The grand diversity of human expression and action means that it is impossible to be wrong. Whatever you see, you can work with. ""If we pause it here, just after the goal's gone in, you can see Nemanja Vidic... ""... smiling, as he mocks the very idea of David de Gea being good enough for Manchester United."" ""... crying, as he laments the once-proud institution that was Manchester United's goalkeeping shirt, currently draped around the slumped shoulders of Ferguson's folly."" ""... making no movement at all, as he professionally keeps the contemptuous sneer from his features."" ""... dropping to all-fours, mooing like a cow, and trying to eat the green grass of the pitch, which just goes to show the effect David de Gea's shaky presence is having on his team-mates' mental well-being. Oh look, Rio Ferdinand's trying to milk him. Silly Rio."" You have to admire the craft. As a story, 'Footballer looks angry after conceding late equaliser' ranks somewhere between Papal defecation locations and the religious leanings of Winnie-the-Pooh. But that didn't stop Neville! It was refreshing to see the former Manchester United man abandon the 'rigour' and 'insight' for which he's been developing a rather unsavoury reputation. He's learning. He's blossoming. He's starting to fully embrace how things are done. Rational and even-handed analysis of Manchester United's retreating backline and the culpability of not only De Gea but Vidic and Antonio Valencia might have been nice. It would also have been dull. But a breakdown in trust? An expensive flop? A dressing-room divided? And all brought to you by the faultless, perfect, truth-enhancing power of television? Marvellous. Just zoom in on his face there...",Raw Data
989,"Danica Patrick laid down the perfect lap on Sunday to earn the pole for the 2013 Daytona 500 (coverage begins Sunday at noon ET on FOX). While she became the first woman to post the fastest speed in qualifying for a NASCAR Sprint Cup race, could she also become the first female competitor to take the checkered flag? Patrick wont have to repeat the feat with 200 flawless laps at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday. She just has to be there at the finish. Here are five reasons why Patrick will or wont win the Great American Race: 1. Patrick is in the Best Equipment Patrick proved during testing, practice and qualifying that she could make the most out of the cars that shes been given. While this isnt the same car she had during Preseason Thunder in January, its a better Chevy SS according to her crew chief Tony Gibson, who reviewed the numbers after taking both models to Stewart-Haas Racings own wind tunnel, Windshear. No other organization showed the dominance that SHR exhibited in time trials. All three cars were clocked among the five fastest times. The Devils Advocate says: Its one thing for a car to perform at its maximum potential for two laps (five miles) at Daytona. Its a whole new challenge for a car to hold up over a 500 mile race. Even the best teams have been bit by gremlins at Daytona. Jeff Gordon, who will start on the front row with Patrick and leads all active drivers with six wins at the track, experienced an engine failure in last years 500 and has also been sidelined by handling and suspension issues. 2. She's really just one of the boys Patrick has shown the ability to post the fastest lap when shes on the track by herself. But can she maintain that pace with 42 fellow competitors that want the Harley J. Earl trophy as desperately as she does? Even her boss Tony Stewart said on Sunday the pole wasnt as important to him as getting the monkey off his back in the 500. To me, my eye is still on next Sunday, Stewart said. Ownership side this Sunday, next Sunday I want it from the driver's side. Patrick has exhibited solid car control during her three seasons in stock cars and courage has never been as issue for the media darling. More importantly, shes been very comfortable at Daytona since she finished sixth in her stock car debut in the 2010 ARCA race an 80-lapper. The following year Patrick finished 10th in the Nationwide Series race when the distance was extended to 250 miles. The Devils Advocate says: Patience is a virtue but not necessarily one of Patricks best traits. When Landon Cassill became racey with Patrick in hte Sprint Cup race at Kansas Speedway last October she dumped him and herself. Certainly, Patrick has logged lots of laps since that incident but drafting in close quarters can be nerve-wracking. In three of her five previous Nationwide starts at Daytona, Patrick wrecked. She was also involved in a crash in her Daytona 500 debut last year; however, it was not of her making. 3. Location, Location, Location Twenty-five of 131 races at Daytona have been won from the pole. Kevin Harvick is the most recent driver to win from the top spot during the July romp in 2010. Winning the pole also guarantees that Patrick will have the first pitbox, which is always a bonus. The Devil Advocate says: While four polesitters have won the July Daytona race since 2004, Dale Jarrett was the last driver to win the Daytona 500 from the pole in 2000. 4. Can a Rookie Win? Absolutely. Trevor Bayne proved that experience isnt the key ingredient for a successful run at Daytona. If a 20-year-old driver can win NASCARs most prestigious race in his debut, then so can Patrick who has raced for two decades and was classically trained in open wheel in Europe and in IndyCar before moving to stock cars. And with the new Generation 6 cars, Patrick is starting with a clean slate just as the rest of the field. She has the knowledge of her Stewart-Haas Racing teammates Tony Stewart and Ryan Newman, who have five Daytona wins between them, as advisors. Plus, a gentle sage in crew chief Tony Gibson to keep Patrick focused and informed. The Devils Advocate says: While Sunday is not technically Patricks coming out party on the 2.5-mile track, she made just two laps last year in her Daytona 500 debut before getting caught in the first ""Big One."" Patrick soldiered on to complete 138 laps in a damaged car and finished 38th. Well have a better idea how she responds in the draft during practice and in the Budweiser Duels on Thursday. 5. Lady Luck There are drivers that insist that luck is when experience meets preparation. When it comes to experience, Patrick has logged miles in four different series at Daytona. As far as strategy for the Daytona 500, Patrick will have veteran crew chief Tony Gibson a Daytona native that has guided drivers to wins before to rely on. His advice for Patrick is to Go out and race in the qualifier so she can gain valuable seat time for Sunday. For her, it is new, Gibson said. You don't want to take the chance of wrecking the car, nobody does. Sometimes there's nothing you can do about it. She's going to have to put herself three wide, four wide, there's no way around it. If we tear it up, we tear it up. You can't run scared all the time. She's going to have to get out there and race. Definitely we're not going to put ourselves in very bad positions. If it looks like it's getting hairy, she can get out, go to the back and ride. We're in a position to do that. The Devils Advocate says: Its difficult for a driver to control their own destiny at restrictor-plate tracks such as Daytona and Talladega, where the best car can get caught up in someone elses mess. As Patrick said on Sunday, her best strategy could very well be to let Jesus take the wheel.",Raw Data
990,"Some of the most memorable, and horrifying, images from Hurricane Katrina came from the Superdome, where thousands of New Orleanians took shelter on Aug. 29, 2005, seeking refuge in one of the few dry, safe places left in a city submerged. QBs add intrigue to Super Bowl XLVII matchup between 49ers and Ravens. An inside look It’s still harrowing to see the photos to this day, more than seven years after the storm, which left more than 1,800 dead: the outer layer ripped off the dome’s roof; the countless residents wandering along highways, waiting in lines to get in, many clutching whatever they could grab before their homes became one of 200,000 swallowed by floodwaters throughout the city; the cots spread across the building’s floor, leaving the stadium looking more like a wartime triage unit than a place where the hometown Saints had just played a preseason football game three days earlier. In time, the Superdome itself would prove neither as safe nor as dry as many had hoped, as unsanitary, dangerous conditions and flooding abetted by holes in the stadium’s roof forced people to evacuate again, to Houston. And in the days and weeks that followed Katrina — before Hurricane Rita’s landfall only added to the city’s plight in mid-September — questions arose regarding the future of the city and, by extension, the then-30-year-old Superdome: What should be done with this landmark? Should it be torn down? Would the Saints, its only professional tenant, even stay in town to make the necessary renovations worthwhile? Should this even be considered a priority, given the sheer wreckage across nearly every square mile of this town? Of course, amid all of the concern over the future of the city and the building itself, the 2013 Super Bowl was the furthest thing from anyone’s mind, which makes it all the more remarkable that New Orleans is hosting Super Bowl XLVII between the 49ers and the Ravens next Sunday, in what some view as the latest — and perhaps ultimate — affirmation that Katrina is finally a distant memory. “We were knocked to our knees and under 15 feet of water for three weeks,” Jay Cicero, president and CEO of the Greater New Orleans sports foundation, said Thursday as he recalled the immediate aftermath of the killer storm. “If you had asked me back then, a week after the storm, whether or not the Superdome was going to be renovated, whether the Saints would be able to return to New Orleans the very next season, whether we’d have that glorious reopening of the Superdome that September, that the Saints would be selling out season tickets every year since, which they never did before, whether we would have gone to an NFC Championship Game within a couple years, then won the Super Bowl, and attracted the Super Bowl in 2013 and had a men’s Final Four six months prior to that, I would have said there’s absolutely no way.” But all of that happened, banding together a city in the process. There’s even a strong case to be made that New Orleans, as it prepares for an estimated 150,000 visitors for the city’s 10th Super Bowl — an event made possible by $1 billion in improvements around the city, from the Superdome, to the airport, to the convention center, to the new streetcar line — is in better shape than it was the last time the game came to town, in 2002. “Hosting the Super Bowl means everything to us,” said Kelly Schulz, VP of communications and public relations at New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. “There is no bigger, more high-profile event that an American city can host, really. So absolutely, it does send a message that New Orleans is not only back, but it’s better than it’s ever been.” Added New Orleans Super Bowl Host Committee co-chairman James Carville: “My hope is it can help bring some real closure here, and that the city can show what it can do."" New Orleans’ revitalization over the last seven-plus years not only is a testament the city’s residents — many of whom never considered abandoning their city — but also to the proprietors and entrepreneurs who embody the area’s distinct culture and stuck around to make sure it emerged in the shape that it has. People such as Ti Martin, who spent her 45th birthday watching helplessly from afar as Katrina wreaked havoc on the only city she’d ever loved. A spunky redhead with an undeniable magnetism to match her charming accent, Martin is a well-known and well-regarded restaurateur in New Orleans. Her Commander’s Palace in the Garden District has long been considered one of the city’s top spots to dine. But after Katrina and Rita got the best of the blue and white Victorian building that houses the 133-year-old establishment, there were tough calls to make about when and where to start the rebuilding process — but no question that Commander’s would eventually be back up and running. “For a lot of people, they live where they live, and they’re happy about where they live, and it’s nice and whatnot, but they could just as easily move or whatever,” Martin said. “The city of New Orleans is not just where you live, it’s like a member of your family.” After 13 months and $6.5 million in renovations, Commander’s Palace reopened on Oct. 1, 2006. But early on, the thrill of the accomplishment was muted by the struggles still affecting the city and its people. “Every night, somebody would come in and they’d say, ‘It’s our last night in New Orleans and we decided to come here before we move,’ and it was so depressing,” said Martin, who admits she had a difficult time sympathizing with those who decided to leave. “Well, now, it seems like every night I’m meeting somebody who just moved to town or who’s moving back, and the type of people that we’re repopulating this city with — it’s just unbelievable.” After five tough years, business at Commander’s finally is back to where it was pre-Katrina — much like all over New Orleans, where tourism numbers plummeted in the immediate aftermath of the storm, from a record 10.1 million visitors in 2004 to 3.7 million in 2006 before climbing back to pre-storm levels in recent years. But such a turnaround never was a sure thing given the stigma that had been placed on the city. “Katrina put us in a situation where the entire world saw images of New Orleans in utter devastation, and even though our French Quarter was dry and most of the tourism areas of the city did not sustain the significant damage like some of the outlying neighborhoods, the brand damage was enormous,” Schulz said. “You really can’t underestimate the amount of damage that was done to the city’s reputation.” Added Martin: “We had a little touch of an inferiority complex before, and now we’ve gone from that to having a little bit of a swagger, and it feels damn good. It’s been a hell of a lot of hard work, but there’s so much going on, and it’s starting to pay off. It’s beautiful.” The restaurant industry has been booming all over New Orleans, a gastronomer’s paradise to begin with, with more than 1,300 restaurants operating in the city — 500 more than there were before Katrina. One of those new venues finding early success in the market belongs to Sean McCusker, who opened Sylvain restaurant in a 214-year-old building in the French Quarter in 2010 after spending 16 years in the publishing industry in New York. Sylvain, so named for a one-act comic opera performed in New Orleans in the late 1700s, is an upscale restaurant in an area of New Orleans better known for its drinking in the streets, and has been met with overwhelming approval from visitors both local and otherwise. “This is probably the most nuanced city in the country, if not the world,” McCusker said. “You have to earn it here, especially if you’re in the food and beverage business. “We focused on locals first, and we didn’t even put a sign out on our place for a good six to nine months. We just kind of let people in the neighborhood find it. … It probably hurt us financially in the short term. But it did definitely pay off in the long term, because the people who came to us at the beginning are still coming.” KAEPERNICKING? 49ers QB's touchdown celebration has taken off taken off on social media. Success during New Orleans’ renaissance hasn’t just been limited to the food and beverage industry, either, as Lauren Thom could attest. A New Orleans native, Thom went to college in Baton Rouge, where she had to house her sister and brother in-law after Katrina forced them to evacuate New Orleans on their wedding night. After Katrina, Thom moved back to her hometown, and in 2009, she used her $2,000 tax refund to open Fleurty Girl, a retail shop she operated out of her own home. The new business forced her and her three kids — a 6-year-old and 3-year-old twins, at the time — to share a room. Thom gave herself a six-month window for the business to succeed or fail, but the Saints’ 2009 Super Bowl run and the publicity gained from a public battle with the NFL over the use of the “Who Dat” slogan led to almost instant success. Within six months, she had a second store, a number that is now up to four, with a fifth set to open Friday. “Everybody told me I was crazy — everyone,” Thom said of opening a store in post-Katrina New Orleans. “My boss was like, ‘I can’t believe you’re doing this; this is so silly.’ I was threatened with custody of my kids; my ex was threatening to take me back to court because I wanted to do this. But I just kept going, I just kept moving forward with it.” There’s no misconception, of course, that football saved New Orleans, or that a Super Bowl can erase the memory of a city once nearly eradicated by Hurricane Katrina. But that hulking dome, once the symbol for post-Katrina strife, will be standing tall on Sunday, shining brightly above a city left in shambles just seven years ago. And for the people who lived through the storm and its aftermath — the people who made it their priority to rebuild the city they love — it’ll represent an enormous sense of pride in what they’ve accomplished. “I was driving on the interstate trying to look at everything from the perspective of a tourist — looking at all the Super Bowl billboards that are up in the city, and then approaching the dome, and it recently got repainted, and it’s got these lights, and it looks amazing,” Thom said. “They change them every night and it’s just so spectacular, and I started to tear up, because I’m just so proud of us. I’m proud of this city and all that we’ve been through. I don’t think people understand what New Orleans has survived. This is a big deal.” Added Martin: “Every now and then when you’ve got your nose to the grindstone and you’re just working, working, working, you’ve got to stop and say, ‘Look what we did.’ And this is going to be another one of those moments.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or e-mail him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com",Raw Data

The pair secured Britain's place in Europe/Africa Group I after Anne Keothavong lost 6-0 6-2 to world number one Caroline Wozniacki. Heather Watson opened the tie in style when she overcame Denmark's Karen Barbat 6-0 6-1, but it was not enough for either nation to secure a safe passage in the group so it came down to the doubles decider. Denmark fielded Wozniacki and Mai Grage with the combination working early as the Danes took the first set 7-5. Watson and Ray rallied, however, winning the final two sets 7-57-5.

992,"Lionel Messi celebrated another goalscoring milestone with four more as Barcelona demolished 10-man Osasuna 5-1 in La Liga on Sunday.The Argentinian went one better than great rival Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick earlier in the evening as he was part of a Barca side who utterly outclassed woefully inferior opposition. His second was his 200th goal in the Primera Division, another landmark feat in his ever-growing list of achievements, which now also includes becoming the first player to score in 11 successive La Liga matches. The fourth brought his total in the league this term to 33 and he is on track to match last season's barely-believable 50. Seventeen more are needed from 17 games; only for Messi would that be considered simple. And next up for him, albeit in the Copa Del Rey semi-finals: Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Pedro was also on target for the Catalans, while Raoul Loe briefly levelled for Osasuna before Alejandro Arribas' sending-off after 27 minutes made their task an almost impossible one. The win preserved Barca's convincing lead over at the top of the Primera Division, while Osasuna remained in relegation danger. Barcelona started quickly and Thiago Alcantara brought a fine parry out of goalkeeper Andres Fernandez after only four minutes. They went ahead seven minutes later through a predictable source. Xavi's exquisite pass from the left played in Messi and he rounded Fernandez to score. The visitors levelled in the 23rd minute as a clearance fell to Loe on the edge of the area and his low shot with the outside of his left foot found the bottom-left corner, with keeper Victor Valdes perhaps unsighted. Parity last just five minutes, though. Arribas conceded a penalty with a handball in the area and was sent off for a second yellow card before Messi stepped up to score low into the corner. And this time there was no way back for Osasuna. Messi was denied a hat-trick by a post as his header from a Dani Alves cross came back off the frame of the goal, but Pedro had better luck five minutes before the break. Again Alves was the provider and his ball in from the right was swept home by the Spain forward. But this match, yet again, was about Messi and he got his hat-trick in the 56th minute, running on to a pass from David Villa down the left of the area, rounding Fernandez and sliding the ball into the empty net. Three became four two minutes later. Villa's pull-back from the left byline picked out Claro Adriano in the area and his pass across goal was flicked in by Messi. The forward has scored five in one match before, against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League, but this time Osasuna, who defended desperately to the end, were spared further embarrassment. While no formal offer has been made, it is believed that talks are continuing between both clubs and Balotelli's agent. Manchester City have maintained throughout this window that Balotelli will not be sold in January. The Italian has regularly been linked with a move back to his homeland since arriving at City in the summer of 2010, and Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri was questioned on his interest in the striker after side's 1-0 victory over Atalanta on Sunday. Allegri was reluctant to discuss another club's player but admitted he was an admirer and indicated that Balotelli's controversial character would not be a problem. ""Balotelli? I won't think about him because he is a Manchester City player,"" Allegri told Sky Italia. ""If he arrives here, then I'll consider how to approach him. Obviously, I wouldn't say no. ""We are setting up a good, disciplined group and that is important in a difficult League like Serie A.""",Raw Data

Barcelona are in, and Chelsea are almost out. Tuesday night saw a tale of two champions heading in opposite directions. For some the results will be cause for schadenfreude, particularly if you hail from the hamlet of Munich in Bavaria. Those folks never got over the fact that Chelsea managed to pip the giants on their home turf thanks to a rearguard action that Napoleon would have admired. Tuesday night, with John Terry and Frank Lampard out, the Chelsea defense crumbled 3-0 to Juventus, a constant, withering threat in Turin. In fact, had it not been for Petr Cech, this game might have had a scoreline better fitting an NFL game. In Moscow, Barcelona downed Spartak by the same scoreline, skating past the Russians on an icy plastic pitch thanks to Lionel Messi. Barcelona – who were denied by Chelsea as well last season – have been outrageously successful this season and their Argentine star is close to smashing another record. With a haul of two goals on the night, Messi needs only five goals to equal Gerd Muller’s mark of 85 in a calendar year. Whether or not you agree with the merits of this particular “record” – it is, in fact, meaningless – there is no mistaking Barcelona’s unstoppable excellence. In truth, Barcelona should be Chelsea. This is a team that has literally been played to death. They have won World Cups and European Championships thanks to being at the heart of Spain’s golden generation. They have dominated La Liga in the past ten seasons and taken three European Cups in the same span; and they have accumulated so many other wee bits of silver that they could open a respectable pawn shop should they wish to. All of that should have come with grave costs – their best players never seem to get any time off. Instead, they keep motoring on. Were doping tests not prevalent, I’d suggest a check of the food stores at La Masia. Chelsea, in contrast, seemed to have reloaded. Oscar, Eden Hazard, Victor Moses, Cesar Azpilcueta –are just some of the spoils acquired by the Blues in an orgy of summer spending. And it’s not like they were joining chaff; Juan Mata, Gary Cahill, the aforementioned Cech and Terry all combined to make a very solid squad. And when Chelsea started this season they looked by far the slickest, silkiest team in all of England. Yet, here we are. Chelsea have slipped badly and they face becoming the first Champions League holders to go out in the groups stages. If there were folks in London who took glee in last year’s wreckage in Manchester, well, there’s another word for that: karma. The untold and possibly unsettling tale that undergirds all of this is that despite their protests to the contrary, English soccer is no longer that dominant. This has been a poor Premier League campaign, only a third of the way in, and much of the best soccer has taken place in Germany, Italy and Spain. England has more money and arguably more stars – but it seems to have less technique and know-how on the European stage. Spain might be dismissed as a “two-team league,” but three of their four teams have qualified for the Round of 16 and only a meltdown will scupper Real Madrid. It doesn’t matter whether you think much of Malaga or Valencia, only that they are in with games to spare. The number of home-grown stars in that league far eclipses England – unless you believe that the likes of Andres Iniesta are less preferable than a Steven Gerrard. Then there’s Germany, often ignored. Top to bottom, it looks to be a stronger league than the Premiership year after year, and the proof is in the fact that no one really wants to have to face Dortmund, Bayern or Schalke. They also have a talented, technically astute mass of home-grown talent that are complimented as opposed to supplanted by imports. As it stands, United are the only British side through. Of the bunch, only a very mediocre Arsenal is odds on to join them. Neither of those teams rely on English players. Manchester City, powered by Argentines, Spaniards and Belgians, are surely out, not having looked like they belonged here in the first place. And the Brazilian and Spanish-powered Chelsea now need a win and help. How meaningful is it that these teams cannot succeed on domestic players alone? Quite significant. One of the reasons Lionel Messi is allowed to be great is that he is surrounded by a stable core of talent. It has been steady, battle-hardened and added to over the years -- rather than reworked and dismantled. Contrast that with Chelsea, which jettisoned many of the players that won last year in Munich and has seen others simply age out. Messi looks like he has a core that can support him for another decade. That cannot be said about either Eden Hazard or Juan Mata, who often look like virtuosos seeking talented partners. For all of Messi’s individual brilliance, he is so good because he is also surrounded by genius. How good would Fernando Torres look if he had Xavi passing to him? We’ll likely never know.

Fourcade, who won the pursuit in Oslo, had to make do with second 13.7seconds back after three penalties while German Erik Lesser trailed by 16.8 overall but took third. And, while he hadn't yet claimed a World Cup win, Moravec was confident he could hold off the charge of World Cup leader Fourcade at the death. ""That was perfect for me; my first victory it is like a dream come true. I tried to enjoy it all. This has been a great season for our team and I think it will continue,"" he said.

995,"''Everyone was really happy for the win,'' Pierce said after Boston beat the Miami Heat 100-98 Sunday. ''It brought a dark cloud in this room when you heard the news.'' When coach Doc Rivers told his players after the game, the joy of ending their six-game losing streak stopped, even if they had just outlasted the team with the best record in the Eastern Conference, which came in with a four-game winning streak. Now the Celtics must try to keep winning without their leader, who suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee late in Friday night's 123-112 loss, also in double overtime, in Atlanta. They won Sunday after Pierce's 22-foot jumper with 31 seconds left gave them a 99-98 lead. But making the playoffs got harder as the Celtics try to hang on to the eighth and final postseason spot in the conference with a 2 1-2-game lead over the Philadelphia 76ers. ''The Rondo news is pretty tough. I knew it before the game,'' Rivers said. ''I just didn't think it was any time to tell any of our guys.'' This game was the first in Boston for Ray Allen since he left the Celtics after five seasons and signed as a free agent with Miami. He scored 21 points. Kevin Garnett had 24 points and 11 rebounds, and Pierce added 17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists for the Celtics. Rondo's injury ''puts this team and the rest of the guys in a position to be ready to step up,'' Pierce said. Sunday's win ''was a perfect example. We showed we are capable.'' James had 34 points for the Heat, whose winning streak stopped at four. ''As much as I've been a rival with Boston over the years, I never want to see anyone go down,'' James said. ''It's terrible, not only for their team but for the league.'' After Pierce's basket, James had a chance to put the Heat ahead but missed a 12-foot jumper with 6.8 seconds to go from the left with defender Jeff Green jumping out at him. Pierce got the rebound and was fouled by Shane Battier. He sank the first shot. Then, as a fan shouted ''This one's for Rondo,'' he missed the second. See how NBA dance teams get crowds all fired up. Miami had one last chance, but Battier missed a long jumper at the buzzer. ''They defended that very well,'' Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ''There are about three different options to it, four different options to it. They defended each one of them.'' The Heat also could have won in the first overtime, but Dwyane Wade, who had 17 points, also missed a long jumper as the buzzer sounded. They had led 93-89 after consecutive baskets by James, but Garnett hit a layup with 1:45 remaining and a shot from the right baseline with 1:14 to go. Boston could have avoided the first overtime when Pierce inbounded from behind his backboard with two seconds left to Jason Terry. But Terry's shot from the top of the key was short. The Heat had tied it on a 3-pointer by James with seven seconds remaining in regulation after Allen missed a 3-pointer from the left corner with 15 seconds to go. Rivers did not mention Rondo's injury in his meeting with reporters about an hour before the game, but Courtney Lee started in his place. Doctors decided to keep Rondo out of the game after he went through his normal pregame routine but complained of pain that he thought was in his hamstring. An MRI was done and team physician Dr. Brian McKeon learned the results during the game. Allen was part of the Big Three with Pierce and Garnett starting in 2007-08. In their first season together, Boston won its 17th NBA championship. He played against the Celtics once before this season, a 120-107 Heat win in Miami in the opener. The crowd gave Allen a standing ovation when highlights of his career with the Celtics were shown on the video board above center court during a timeout with 5:33 left in the first quarter. At the Miami bench, he raised his left hand in recognition. WHO SETS THE CURVE? Check out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo. ''When I saw it, just all those emotions came streaming back from all the great things we did here,'' Allen said. ''I'll always be a Celtic in my mind.'' Allen entered the game about a minute after the tribute and was booed when he touched the ball. The boos came down again when he took two free throws — missing the first, making the second — three minutes into the second quarter. Allen went back into the game with 30 seconds left in the first half with the score tied at 43 and made a layup with 16 seconds to go. But Pierce sank a driving layup with 4.3 seconds remaining to tie it 45-45 at halftime. ''What happened to Ray is never good for this franchise,'' Pierce said, ''but it wasn't about Ray. It was about us playing the defending champs.'' It was Miami's first game in Boston since it won Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals behind James' 45 points. Early in the second half, James hit a pair of 3-pointers from the same spot on the left, putting the Heat in front 51-48. The Celtics rallied and led 64-61 with 1:49 remaining in the third quarter. But the Heat scored the last seven points of the period on a jumper by Norris Cole, a free throw by Allen and two 15-footers by James and led 68-64 going into the fourth. Notes: James and Chris Bosh each had 16 rebounds for the Heat. The last time the Celtics played consecutive double-overtime games was on March 11 and 13, 1951.",Raw Data

997,"I know I’m not the only one looking forward to the visits over the next two weekends – John Salley on Saturday night for the Indiana game and Dennis Rodman next Friday for the Chicago Bulls – at The Palace from two of the central figures on the great Bad Boys champions. I know Pistons fans old enough to remember those title teams are going to have a lot of memories stirred and emotions brought to the surface by their returns. When I think back to the time they were drafted, I was so convinced Jack McCloskey was going to get it right as I looked at the upsides of both of those guys. He felt like if there was one thing the Pistons needed, it was some guys who could get after people defensively, play above the rim and fly up and down the court. And when I first saw these guys, I knew exactly why he liked them. They added an entire new dimension to the Pistons. In fact, the Pistons were so good by the end of that 1986-87 season it was scary. I’ll tell you how scary. John McLeod, who later broadcast games with me and was coaching a very good team in Dallas at the time, told me every coach in the league suddenly feared the Detroit Pistons on some level. Once Worm and Spider were added, the Pistons had all the bases covered. The veterans were still young and these guys were like racehorses. You didn’t have anybody with anywhere near middle-age miles on them and you had these two young guys who could absolutely fly. John Salley, of course, came from a Georgia Tech program that among the best in the country at that time, so everybody had seen him play on TV a bunch. But none of us knew a lot about Dennis Rodman, except that he had a reputation as a great rebounder. At the time, Dick Motta was broadcasting games with me. When we saw Dennis in the preseason, Motta – and here’s a guy who’s on the Hall of Fame ballot himself – said he could be an outstanding rebounder in this league. The next time we did a game – still in the preseason, remember – coach Motta said to me, “George, I have to tell you, this guy is going to be the best rebounder since Bill Russell.” He said that after seeing Dennis twice in the preseason. I think all the rebounding titles back up what Dick said. It didn’t take us long to realize that Worm was the real deal. And the players always said he was such a great athlete that if you gave him 45 days with a world-class coach, he could win an Olympic medal in some event or another. He was just freakish in that way and wanted so much to be a good teammate that he would do whatever you asked him to do and then some. John Salley was, like all the rest of the Bad Boys, a great teammate and a very intelligent player. He brought so much smarts to the table and was willing to accept his role. One of them, other than blocking shots and getting up and down the court and causing matchup problems, was making the last-second shot on the shot clock. When they ran plays all the way down to about five seconds and didn’t have anything going on, they’d throw it to John. That’s a tough position to be in, but I bet if we could go back and track those times he made about 65 percent of them as the last option. He could make shots. And demoralize the opposition when he did. Spider was a very funny guy. He had such a quick wit. He had a way of phrasing things in a way you wouldn’t forget them. One of his great contributions was the nickname he hung on Chuck Daly when he said “our coach dresses like a millionaire so we call him Daddy Rich.” That will forever be the late, great Chuck Daly’s moniker. Chuck loved all his players, but I know he had a special spot in his heart for both Dennis Rodman and John Salley and the feeling was mutual. They were so much a part of those championship teams. They weren’t called the X-factor for nothing. They brought the Pistons up to a world championship level as soon as they laced them up for the Pistons. Witness what happened in 1987. If it weren’t for one unfortunate pass that Larry Bird picked off and a collision between Adrian Dantley and Vinnie Johnson in a Game 7, the Pistons would have been in the Finals in their rookie year. And with all their skill and new-found athleticism with Worm and Spider, they might have won it that year. They were the last real pieces that needed to be added to the puzzle to make the Pistons one of the greatest teams of all time and that’s really saying something about two young players. That’s why there will always be a soft spot in my heart for that entire team, including Worm and Spider. When you think about the Bad Boys being one of the greatest teams of all-time and you think about the fact those are probably the two guys who put them over the top, just to see them again will be great. I saw John earlier this season – he’s a great guy, certainly a friend and somebody who deserves all the success in the world. He’s an entertainer these days and a darn good one. We all know he was an entertainer back in the day, as well. For Dennis to come back, as emotional as he is, and have his number retired, will be a great way for the Pistons to give back to him for all the blood, sweat and tears he gave to the Pistons in making them champions. I’m looking forward to seeing both of these great Pistons come back to The Palace.",Raw Data

After Clijsters gave Belgium an insurmountable advantage, Yanina Wickmayer defeated Melanie Oudin 6-2, 6-0 for a 4-0 lead. The U.S. team secured its only point when Liezel Huber and Vania King beat Kirsten Flipkens and An-Sophie Mestach 6-3, 7-5 in doubles. Mattek-Sands gave the U.S. team its first set of the weekend when she outlasted Clijsters in the tiebreaker, but the second-ranked Belgian easily dominated the No. 48 from then on. ``It really feels good to see that 3-0 on the board so soon,'' Clijsters said. It is the first time in Fed Cup competition that the Americans have lost two ties in a row, after being defeated by Italy in last year's final. Belgium will play the Czech Republic in Charleroi on April 16-17 for a place in the final. After Mattek-Sands lost to Wickmayer on Saturday, with unforced errors costing her throughout, the American was aggressive and precise from the start Sunday. She served for the set at 5-4, but let Clijsters back in for the tiebreaker. Despite the noise from the 10,000 fans at Sports Palace, she didn't crumble in a tiebreaker in which both players had great trouble winning points on serve. ``Against top players, she can play a great game,'' Clijsters said. ``I was just hoping she would not keep it up.'' Losing the first set roused the fighter in Clijsters, and she then took charge, never giving Mattek-Sands a chance in a speedy, high-quality second set. In the decider, Clijsters immediately broke and continued pressing as errors slipped back in Mattek-Sands' game.

999,"Tamika Catchings hasn't forgotten how close she came to clearing the biggest hurdle of her basketball career. Catchings is a seven-time All-Star, five time defensive player of the year and the 2011 WNBA MVP. She also has won three Olympic gold medals, but is still seeking her first league championship. That almost changed in 2009. The Fever led Phoenix 2-1 in the best-of-five WNBA Finals and hosted Game 4 at home. The city was fired up and ready to celebrate, but the Mercury beat the Fever 90-77, took the series back to Phoenix and won the title at home in Game 5. Indiana is again on the cusp of the championship after beating Minnesota 76-59 in Game 3 of the finals on Friday to take a 2-1 lead. Once again, the Fever can clinch at home. This time, Catchings will take a different approach. ''Don't let your highs get you too high and let your lows get you too low,'' she said Saturday. ''I felt like we celebrated too much after Game 3 in 2009 and we came out in Game 4 and had an opportunity and we let it slip away.'' The Fever are in position to win the title, in part, because of Shavonte Zellous' career-high 30 points on Friday. Indiana led 70-33 late in the third quarter, the largest lead ever for a team in a finals game. Catchings expects a tougher contest on Sunday. ''I think that, for us, it's going to be a 40-minute game,'' she said. ''We're going to have to come out and play Fever basketball for 40 minutes. We talked about that as a team, just not getting content with where we're at. We're 40 minutes away, so we have to come out and stay focused and stay ready.'' A win by the defending champion Lynx - vying to become the first team to win consecutive titles since Los Angeles in 2001 and '02 - would send the series back to Minneapolis for a decisive Game 5 on Wednesday night. Minnesota was embarrassed by its play in Game 3, but is focused on the fact that they can still win the title. ''We are disappointed with yesterday,'' Minnesota forward Rebekkah Brunson said. ''That is done and over with. We can't do anything about that. We have to be optimistic about tomorrow and being able to do what we have to do. We haven't lost any confidence we still know what we are capable of doing. So we are just going to step on the court tomorrow and prove it.'' Catchings knows how talented the Lynx are - she played with Seimone Augustus, Maya Moore and Lindsay Whalen on the U.S. Olympic team at the London Games during the summer. Anything less than absolute focus could extend the series. ''We've talked about defense, we've talked about offense, making a few changes, but really I think the biggest thing is just intensity,'' Catchings said. Fever center Erlana Larkins has had 15 rebounds in each of Indiana's wins in the series. Larkins said team rebounding will play a role in whether the Fever can end the series on Sunday. ''We have to come out and continue to be in attack mode,'' she said. ''We have to rebound most importantly and then, secondly, continue to take care of the ball.'' Minnesota took the intensity to the Fever in Game 2, but Indiana was more assertive in Game 3. Whalen said that needs to change in Game 4. ''We need to be coming out with a little more aggressive mindset and mentality,'' she said. ''You wish you weren't saying that in the finals, that you have to get up there and be more intense and be more on the ball, but we need to have that. Good thing for us because we have another game tomorrow night to come out here and do better.'' Minnesota outscored the Fever 21-6 in the fourth quarter on Friday. Minnesota hopes to draw from the strong finish, even though the game was clearly decided at that point. ''What we do want to bottle up is the energy and intensity that the second group, the bench players, came in and played with,'' Augustus said. Indiana will be without reserve guard Jeanette Pohlen for the rest of the series. The Fever announced that she tore the ACL in her left knee during Game 2 in Minneapolis. Fever guard Katie Douglas has missed the whole series with a sprained left ankle. Minnesota didn't seem concerned about either situation. ''Them being down two players has nothing to do with anything,'' Brunson said. ''They have been playing well without them. So it's not like this is something new that just happened for tomorrow night. They have been playing extremely well with the team that they have and they are going to play that way tomorrow.''",Raw Data
