3,I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.,89101,dt0ucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/,4274,1573175984,"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\[CITY\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

There are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) 

As you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores.

 

[ google search results for generic query \\""San Antonio Women\\""](https://preview.redd.it/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)

From his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  


***But did you ever wonder why… Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***

  
***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***

So began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…

&#x200B;

# The Research

I started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… 

* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? 
* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and
* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?

Well let’s break it down one-by-one…

 

**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**

I compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…

[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)

As it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.

Interesting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.

[google trend statistics for search term \\""bbw\\""](https://preview.redd.it/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)

 *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*

 

**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**

Using [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.

[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)

Again, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).

I guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.

*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*

 

**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**

Tremendously, that’s how.

I literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros & Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!

Using cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\[CITY\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).

[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)

Well Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… 

&#x200B;

We have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?

&#x200B;

# The Analysis

With my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \*sniff\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.

Charles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…

&#x200B;

**‘The Biggest Loser’**

Between the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the ""*curious""* column.

* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)
* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)

 

[ W\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https://preview.redd.it/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)

Now I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.

&#x200B;

**‘My -25% Life’**

San Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:

* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg
* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg
* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg

Note: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\*FG)–(0.7\*FGA)–\[0.4\*(FTA-FT)\]+(0.7\*ORB)+(0.3\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\*AST)+(0.7\*BLK)–(0.4\*PF)-TOV*

Here’s what the analysis looks like:

You can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.

Heat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*).

These huge performance declines are damning. But what do they truly *tell us*?

#  Conclusion

Well, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?

Every Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t hit free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.

For Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.

The Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).

The excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…

>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  
>  
>  
*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*

It is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. 

That’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**

**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™. In fact, it’s** ***great.***

12,Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:,31000,6cbgx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6cbgx1/wilt_chamberlain_secretly_dominated_professional/,1490,1495329131,"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http://imgur.com/vNZZsm5)

Calculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:

* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)

* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)

* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)

* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league

[Image 5](http://i.imgur.com/ecuUBnC.png)

Wilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, ""George Marcus"", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.

This is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.

*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!

*EDIT*

IMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http://www.bardown.com/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He ""only"" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!",0.92,top,5/20/17 18:12

So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.

#Calls going against Rockets:

1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.

2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.

3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.

4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).

6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)

7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)

8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.

#Calls going against Warriors:

1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.

2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

This was felt in every errant paper ball or contested mid range jumper at the local Y. The basketball world has not only lost a legend in the prime of his life but also eight others lost too soon, including his daughter Gigi.

26,How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets.,24924,4e8ikq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4e8ikq/how_my_nba_experience_turned_into_a_nightmare/,1360,1460365294,"**4/11 - Here is an update since I don't think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me.**
___________________________________

StubHub has reached out to me and advised me that, in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats, they will get me tickets to the home opener next year.

The rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation. I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.
I'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.
__________________________________



**TL:DR – StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) – they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**
_______________

Let me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.

I am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of… everything.  We don’t have much.  We haven’t been to the playoffs in 10 years – the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.

I’ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building – Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  

The entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena – tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don’t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It’s the only real arena we have ever had – we don’t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  

It is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a “cow town” – unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.

After all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team – Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.

With that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the “old barn” after 28 years.

I was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources – Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others – Craigslist comes to mind.  

I would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub – I’ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.

Unfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.
 
Yesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 – expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  

The Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures – it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.

I [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.

We arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I’ve ever seen it.

We made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn’t register so I tried again.  REFUND.

At this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed – like I was some scammer or didn’t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  

I pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  

The door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, “I’m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can’t help you – you need to call them but they’re very good at refunds.”

REFUND.  There’s that word again.  

I don’t want a refund – I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, “all of our representatives are assisting other callers – we will be with you shortly.”

I am basically beside myself by now – I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets – plus fees.  

I can’t believe what I am hearing.  I still don’t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.

I don’t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, “man, I’m so sorry – we’ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.”

7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm

By 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line – after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.

He was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, “Did the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.”  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.

I couldn’t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game – this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That’s when he dropped the bomb on me.

He said, and I quote, **“I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.”**

So there it is – StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  

He told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn’t then, and it’s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.

We went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot – with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn’t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.

The final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their “guarantee” to get you in the game.  I couldn’t believe it.  

As soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, “oh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.”  I knew I got my refund last night!  

I asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, “No I don’t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It’s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.”  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I’m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.

A couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  

I have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:

* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?

* Why does StubHub not warn it’s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?

* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn’t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.

- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.

* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative’s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.

Here is StubHub’s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):

**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**

* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*

* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*

* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*

*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*


I was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.


I apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this.",0.88,top,4/11/16 2:01

The spirit of the wager was the winning team donates to the other teams kids hospital. Clippes fans have wanted to be in this so much I'm hoping now they step up. I'd suggest donating to either city's kids hospital. You want to keep your donation local give to CHLA, want to show Toronto some love give to Sick Kids in Toronto. for Lakes and Raptors fans I'm suggesting they each give to the other charity. As a Raptors fan I'm still going to give to CHLA. There is no reason not to in my mind.

They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.

* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.

* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.

* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.

* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.

* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.

* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.

* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.

* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.

* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.

* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.

* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.

So as you bitch and complain about how your team hasn't done anything in a long time or how you only have one All-Star and you're disappointed you didn't get another, remember that things could always be worse.",0.92,top,7/17/19 14:36
33,Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night,23522,bowigy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bowigy/rachel_nichols_and_the_espn_crew_were_extremely/,2420,1557946856,"I’m not sure if this has been posted by someone already, but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams, save for maybe the Knicks, to all of the other draft picks, and to the Pelicans. Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. 

First off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don’t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.

Then, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as “who gets Zion.” Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it’s only going to Zion?

And finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team’s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an “asset” to trade for AD. I’m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.

Now I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said “no.”

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Miami Heat**

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

LeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron’s favorite song “Super Freak”

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

LeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

LeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.

**Sacramento Kings**

LeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that’s where he belongs.

**San Antonio Spurs**

LeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he’s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

**Utah Jazz**

LeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don’t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.

**Washington Wizards**

LeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.



**EDIT**

Some of you have been asking for this, so here you go...

35,I sold Josh Hart a Switch in 2017. And he still owes me. (Repost from /Lakers),23072,brvala,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/brvala/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still/,1756,1558593390,"#UPDATE: http://imgur.com/gallery/c8btRei

Justice is served! Josh reach out and sent me this.
Thank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!

Back in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.
He made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.
The conversation went as follows:

 http://imgur.com/gallery/WkSFMJm

We agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.

He did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.

That was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.

I have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.

So please Josh....just pay up bro.

Because DeSean’s post was a quote attributed to Hitler, it cannot be debated that it wasn’t anti-Semitic and thus I don’t see any possible errors with the title. PLEASE leave this up for discussion. We need some kind of discourse.

I’m amazed and shocked by this. For those who don’t know, [DeSean Jackson posted a quote from Hitler](https://imgur.com/gallery/gSb7eyd) (edit- now said to be Farrakhan but written as Hitler) last night on his Instagram. Stephen Jackson replied with [this video today](https://streamable.com/yk2vur) about the whole situation, saying Jackson was “speaking the truth” and trying to get educated. The comments of the post also encourage the same “Jews control everything” hate that have fueled terrors of the past, with [Stephen Jackson even replying to one of them.](https://imgur.com/a/7YFggCE?fbclid=IwAR325lH10U5judJVIOxr3o3Ay-OUV6k7muLRgMCYMTzQxkoNVZPS58Cy-uI)

I’m extremely disappointed by Stephen Jackson (who has been a face of BLM) as well as this not getting traction in the media yet and even getting removed here. We say we are anti-hate but we can’t have double standards when we do so.

**EDIT-** Stephen Jackson deleted the video and has posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCXdZpzlVEf/), basically doubling down on his comments with a follow-up just as infuriating as the first post. He has seen a bit of backlash on IG (and some praise) but this should really be a bigger story given his platform and following. **How is it getting almost no traction in the NBA world?** The majority of the responses to this thread here have been really encouraging to see, and to the people commenting “Well, Jews do run everything”… I urge you to read about how dangerous this notion has been in history, particularly in the context of the Holocaust.

“My girls and I want to thank the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time. Thank you for all the prayers. We definitely need them. We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe — the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna — a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri. We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality. To honor our Team Mamba family, the Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the MambaOnThree Fund to help support the other families affected by this tragedy. To donate, please go to MambaOnThree.org. To further Kobe and Gianna’s legacy in youth sports, please visit MambaSportsFoundation.org.

Thank you so much for lifting us up in your prayers, and for loving Kobe, Gigi, Natalia, Bianka, Capri and me. #Mamba #Mambacita #GirlsDad #DaddysGirls #Family ❤️”

38,The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.,22824,byskdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/byskdn/the_outrage_of_nba_fans_is_disproportionate/,2960,1560163772,"I'd like to preface this by stating that what GSW part-owner Mark Stevens did in game 3 was unacceptable. He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.

&nbsp;

However, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.

&nbsp;

I realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. 

&nbsp;

The public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.

&nbsp;

People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.

&nbsp;

>""A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.""

&nbsp;

>""The support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done.""

&nbsp;

>""I have 2 young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard. Which I do. I hold myself to a high, high standard.""

&nbsp;

These are all quotes from Kyle Lowry. The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. 

&nbsp;

This was one of his quotes on that day:

&nbsp;

>""B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!""

&nbsp;

He then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. 

&nbsp;

If Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?

&nbsp;

In August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. 

&nbsp;

Two years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.

&nbsp;

He went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. 

&nbsp;

At the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. 

&nbsp;

I was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.

&nbsp;

OJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to ""drugs of abuse"" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.

&nbsp;

Jason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.

&nbsp;

Darren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.

&nbsp;

I'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA.

Buncha liberal hippies with their ""activated charcoal"" and their ""functioning state government"" and all that other PC nonsense.  You dont need that in your life.

### Melo, at a glance

* 215th all-time in ws/48, tied with Corey Maggette
* not in top 250 for career TS%
* not in top 250 for career Offensive Rating

###Melo in Denver 
""Melo was actually good in denver!"" Sure!  ""Melo was a top 5 player in denver!"" [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DCJXYbBB7w) While more dynamic than his plodding, interminably jab-stepping, Knicks iteration, he was never actually a top 5 player. He only made it out of the first round once.
 
####First: Melo has never been better than LeBron. 
Lebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on.

####Second: Denver Melo was  *never* better than Kobe or Dirk
From 2005-2012, there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk. Melo *never* finishes above these guys in all-nba over this period. Not once. More importantly, with the benefit of retrospect, we can see these two (along with LeBron) were great every season, always healthy, and whenever they had *any* talent around them, contended for titles/MVPs. They got everything out of their team, year after year. There's not a single season you wouldn't trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver.  (To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in 2009, when he beat the Mavs in the second round: Dirk averaged 34/12/4 on 53/38/92 shooting in that series--if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team, they would've been even better. Dirk was also 1st team All-Nba to Melo's 3rd. Melo also didn't even make the all-star team.)

So: Melo is at best, the 4th best player any season from 2005-2012. I now just have to establish that there were at least *2* other guys who were better each season during that period, and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top 5 rankings.

#### Numbers 4, 5, 6 
Here i'm going to list three players (in any order), that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season. Why three, when I only need two? Because fuck Melo. Honestly, in a lot of these seasons I could list ~10+ players. Finally, just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they're no longer better than Melo--they probably are--it's just that there are 3 more inarguable players. 

##### 2005-2011
2005 | 2006 | 2007| 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011
- | - | - | - | - | - | -  
Nash | Nash | Nash | Dwight | Dwight | Dwight | Rose
Duncan | Duncan | Duncan | CP3 | CP3 | Durant | Durant
Shaq | Wade | Wade | Garnett | Wade | Wade | Wade



### Melo in New York
Unlike his team USA compatriots, Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam, instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks. While not as athletic as Denver Melo, it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter. It's also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games. He won *one* playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks. In the east, guys.

And then it got worse. Knicks Melo never made the playoffs, let alone an all-nba team after 2013, so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top 5 purposes. Just because people still *thought* he was good, I went all the way to 2015, where became pretty clear he's wasnt even top 15 anymore. Kobe and Dirk start declining here, so I expanded it to **4** players besides LeBron. Still wasnt very hard. Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non-Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo.

As a sidenote: the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in 3 of the next 4 seasons (including 57 in 2012), and only finished behind in 2014 by 1 game (37 to 36). 
 
##### 2012-2015

2012| 2013| 2014| 2015
- | - | - | -
Kobe | Duncan | Steph | Steph |
Durant | Durant | Durant | Durant |
CP3 | CP3 | CP3 | Westbrook | 
Dwight | M.Gasol | Harden | Harden |

##### 2013: The year Melo might have been top 5
Ok, even I have to admit this. In 2013, Melo has a decent case for his only top 5 season. He leads the league in scoring, shoots a good percentage, and even wins a playoff series. It's by far his best season as a Knick, and likely, the best season of his career. He has a career high in ws/48, with .184, and finishes 9th overall in offensive win shares (really high for him).

Melo also finishes 3rd in MVP voting, and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time (and being in NYC), he did have a great year. 

Still though: LeBron, Durant, clearly better. CP3 has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference.  Tim Duncan makes 1st team all-nba, and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals. Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year, wins more games, and goes to the western conference finals. He finishes *3rd* in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant. It's counter-intuitive, but Gasol has a really strong argument. That's 5, but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation, and honestly, I'd take either of them over Melo in 2013. That's 7. 

Maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe Melo was top 5 in 2013. But that would be his *one* year as a top 5 player. One very debatable season. The next year he misses the playoffs and falls out of the conversation forever.

And Magic in LA and Ballmer there too,
They’d just calmed the hell down, which was long over due.

When all of a sudden there arose a new tweet, 
People sprang to hit new, to see who had who beat. 

Away to their phones they flew like a flash
They smashed on f5, and prayed the whole internet didn’t crash.

Lebron sees his chance of a new superteam grow, 
But ask him if it is one and I’m sure he’ll say no,

When what to our wondering eyes should appear,
Why a brand new post right there in the clear,

With a little bold writer, so lively and quick,
I knew in that moment a woj bomb I did click,

More rapid than raptors his words they came,
And he stayed very silent, his sources he never names,

Now SIMMONS, now SHAMS, now SKIP and SHANNON, 
on RDA, on Masai, on Windhorst and JALEN,

To the top of the window! To the Top of r/all!
The excitement’s so palpable there’s sweat on my balls. 

As band wagoners that before a big trade trade fly,
When someone calls out their flair switch, they say “bye bitch, bye.”

False alarm?! Yes sadly, Woj did have some news,
about the Greek freak?!... YES! but just about his new shoes,

They sprang to their helicopter, the cameramen they did go, 
And away they all flew to a car, #tbt to that white bronco.

I never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.

July 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c134ht/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.

[He sent me a box in the mail.](https://imgur.com/a/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.

Being a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.

If there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.

Edit: Apologies if I came off as asking for more. That was not my intention whatsoever. I could've made a better choice of words, but I don't expect anymore. I could've done without the smash Bros comment, but I wasn't asking for more. I got more than I asked for.",0.87,top,8/10/19 19:20

59,"Not enough is made of the fact that LeBron got Kevin Love to join him in Cleveland and commit long-term, but then LeBron himself didn't commit long-term and routinely undercut Love in one way or another. And through all that Love never complained once and appreciated everything.",18663,8yyx4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not_enough_is_made_of_the_fact_that_lebron_got/,1420,1531654541,"Kevin Love changed his game more than anyone to adapt to playing with LeBron. He also bore the brunt of LeBron's frustrations during his Cavs tenure with indirect jabs and rumors of trades involving Love.

This is a summary of how Brian Windhorst described it on The Lowe Post:

> Kyrie Irving ""opted out of what Love is dealing with,"" Windhorst said. ""Love deals with the persecution of being a LeBron teammate, of being blamed, of dealing with his social-media undercutting, of being the fall guy, as he's called himself.""

> He added: ""There have been so many days and nights where Kevin Love has walked out of a building feeling beleaguered or beaten down either directly because of LeBron"" or indirectly.

> But Windhorst says Love insists that it's all worth it because playing with James also means playing late into the season and competing for championships.

> ""I have to give Kevin a real major hat tip for being a professional and being an adult about it,"" Windhorst said. ""He has always seen the big picture ... He has always maintained that this is all worth it, that playing in these late games — I mean, this is a guy who played for six years, whatever it was, never sniffed the playoffs. He's like: 'This is where I'm at right now. This is the charge for playing with [James].'"" 

For fuck's sake, Kevin Love literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with LeBron.

Despite all that LeBron to the very end never seemed to appreciate what Love went through for him. When he signed with the Lakers, Love found out from a notification and HE called LeBron to tell him he loved him.

Man, I just really admire Kevin Love and his strength and big heart in the face of what he puts up with.

Some of the players are somewhat out of position, but I made sure they weren't more than one spot away from their listed position. Also, I had to dig pretty deep so some of the players are recently retired or are currently in the D-League.

69,Is having Lebron really worth the trouble?,17469,6olkrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6olkrv/is_having_lebron_really_worth_the_trouble/,1009,1500638686,"People were interested in seeing how I came up with the value Lebron brings to the Cavs, Dan Gilbert, and Downtown Cleveland as a whole. I've decided to make this thread so those that were interested could see how I arrived at the valuation.

A few days ago an interesting thread arose accusing Lebron of handicapping the Cavs this offseason. Because of his contract demands for his friends, the Cavs could not make many offseason moves. Further, they're having to pay tens of millions in luxury tax just to make this man happy. This prompted u/jushin33 to ask:
> Has anyone looked at how much value Cavs would lose if Lebron left vs the tax savings? 

Why is Dan Gilbert so willing to pay out the nose in luxury taxes rather than let Lebron walk and pocket the savings? Surely he's not worth it at this point, right? 

Let’s begin by looking at attendance before we get into the financial aspect. How many more faces travel to Quicken Loans Arena to see the King?

> Attendance prior to return: 17,329
> Return: 20,562
> 2017: 20,562

Given 41 home games, this is 132,553 more people coming in yearly compared to the most recent season without him.

With playoffs that is at LEAST another 164,496 people whose offseason has not come early provided there is a minimum 8 playoff home games. To get this number I accounted for the fact that QLA would have a patronage of 0 because the team has not made the playoffs without Lebron in the last 20 years, so each home game is an increase by 20,562. 

Interesting to note, Quicken Loans Arena max capacity is, you’ve guessed it, 20,562 people. The arena has been sold out every game since Lebron’s return. 
 
Now let's look at revenue:
> Year before: $145M
> Return: $149M
> 2017: $233M

I’m going to say 2015 was an outlier year. Lebron announced his return in July, 3 months before the NBA season began. The organization may have needed time to adjust to the sudden good fortune. In 2016, after having Lebron for a full regular and offseason, the team took advantage of his prowess, posting a revenue of $191M.

A lot of people asked about playoff revenue. The Cavaliers make an average of $81 per fan at full capacity during the regular season. Assuming a sweep each round, we get 8 hosted home games per post season. **This gives us $13,324,176 a year in revenue brought in** **SOLELY FROM HAVING LEBRON ON THE TEAM**. He’s been a lock to make the finals every year and, for a team that suffered four straight years of zero playoff games, this is literally money they would not see without him.

The Cavaliers had an operating loss of 40m in the 2017 season. I should note that this is the only loss the team has seen since drafting Lebron. This is wholly attributed to the dramatic increase in player expenses this year. In 2016 the team spent 87M on players. In 2017, this number rose to a whopping $131M. Before that, the Cavaliers went from an average operating income of $10m a year without Lebron, to $22.5M a year between 2015-2016. This is interesting to note because, given these figures, the team’s actual operating hit from adding Lebron drops to around $16M. 

Mr. Gilbert has suffered a net loss from re-signing Lebron of $16M…so far. Let’s see if he makes it back into the black. 


The Cavalier’s player expense hit is a sight to behold. Luxury tax ain’t no joke. However, after this season, the Cavaliers have a lot of salaries coming off the books and will only have $80-90M in owed player expenses. Were Dan Gilbert to resign Lebron, find cheaper talent, and maintain a revenue stream of, let’s say $200M to be conservative, he would make out like a bandit. Lebron would demand a salary higher than Curry’s and Harden’s, yes, but the team also has multiple deals coming in that would offset this. Goodyear, I believe, just signed on a $10m/year logo placement and the local tv deal of ten years at $26m a year ended this past season and is expected to at least double when the new deal is signed. All of that is in the future, however. Let’s look at what Lebron has already brought him.
> **Edit: Some people are taking issue with his impact on the valuation of the team as a whole. Whether it be the Clippers sale or revenue sharing. It was just a quick thing I noticed while putting this together and thought it would be interesting to add. Has no effect on the amount of revenue Lebron generates yearly. Dude brings in bank. I'll still leave it below, though.** 
> 
> Cavs value year before return: 515M
> Year of: 915M
> 2017: $1.2B
> 
> Wow. Dan Gilbert’s networth is $5.1B. The team he purchased at $375M has ballooned to become an asset worth $1.2B. ~~Lebron is literally responsible for $825M of his net worth from basketball operations alone.~~

Basketball operations alone? Donajello, are you saying that Lebron has generated even MORE wealth for Dan Gilbert? Short answer: yes. Long answer: …you should probably sit down for this.

With foot traffic in downtown Cleveland skyrocketing with everyone coming to watch Lebron play, it is only natural that local businesses would reap the rewards. Dan Gilbert is the largest solo investor into the downtown Cleveland economy. He has invested more than $1B into the area and is the owner of 12 local businesses. This includes clubs, bars, and restaurants – all things people look for after a high-octane game. Bar owners in the area, ranging from small to large, have seen an increase in revenue of 30-200% on game nights. Demand for local hotel rooms have risen 8.6% since Lebron’s return. Lebron’s presence “increased the number of restaurants within 1 mile of a stadium by about 12.8% and the number of eating and drinking establishments by about 13.7%” to meet demand per a Harvard study. Employment in the hospitality industry in increased 9.9% upon the King’s return.

How much is all this worth? A study funded by the city of Cleveland along with the Cavaliers that was conducted by The Plain Dealer estimated in 2010 that Lebron James was key to bringing $135 per additional person downtown to see a home game. This includes parking, dinners, occasional hotels, and other expenses. That’s about $600k a night and $18,265,500 a year. The study also estimated that the downtown area sees an increase in foot traffic of 105,000 during playoffs. That gives us $113,400,000 over 8 home games. Note: the original estimate in the study of $180 included ticket prices. I’ve removed the $45 average ticket price because we are solely looking at revenue outside of the stadium. Their number did NOT include concession spending. 

**TL;DR: Dan Gilbert suffered a $40m loss, $27m of that coming from luxury taxes last season. Lebron increased team revenue by $88M from the highest grossing year without him to today. Outside of the stadium Lebron is responsible for $18,265,500 in spending during the season in downtown Cleveland, and $113,400,000 during playoffs. Dan Gilbert owns the Cavaliers and is the largest investor into downtown Cleveland to the tune of over $1B and 12 businesses.**

**Lebron has brought in about $219,665,500 a year just by coming back home.**

**Why would Dan Gilbert and the organization hop, jump, and skip to please Lebron, even to the point of paying exorbitant luxury taxes to sign his friends? Well, the proof is in the numbers. No king has been this profitable since Midas.**  

Edit 2: Lebron has even brought me gold. Is there anything this man cannot do? Seriously, thank you kind stranger.

Going to quickly clarify a few common questions. (Like 100 folks asked the same things)

1. The City of Cleveland reported an increase in traffic to the downtown area of 105,000 PER DAY A HOME PLAYOFF GAME WAS PLAYED. $135 * (105,000*8) for the lowest estimate.

2. $135 doesnt mean every person literally spent $135 per night. The city took their increased revenue and divided by the increased traffic on game nights.

3. No Dan Gilbert doesn't make every penny of the 131M/year Lebron brings to the downtown area... However, businesses saw an average yearly increase in revenue ranging from 30% to 200% depending on their size, much of this coming during the period of playoffs. Gilbert owns billions worth of businesses in the area, revenue of those businesses increased as a direct result of the increased spending.

4. The Clippers sold for $2B. Thanks, I get it. Lebron isn't responsible for ALL of the 1.2B valuation, but he does add to it. However, that has ZERO impact on the revenue he brings in from people who come to see him play, which is my main concern. No one travels to Cleveland because they heard the Clippers were sold.

Meanwhile all they had from that game about Kukoc is him being scored on twice.

 But in reality Kerr had 11 pts that game on 3/7 FGA, while Kukoc had 21 pts with 7/11 FGA. 3/4 threes made. Kukoc made 14pts on 5/5 FGA in third quarter and kept Bulls in game. But had no mention.

 Then it comes big segment about game 5 against Jazz in the finals and again not a single mention of Kukoc who had 30pts that game on a RIDICULOUS EFFICIENCY with 11/13 FGA. 4/6 from threes and was only starter in +. MJ for example had 28 points on 9/26 FGA.Pippen had 6pts from 2/16 FGA. Kukoc's shooting was what made that game tight.

 They didn't mention that Phil Jackson drew the last shot FOR KUKOC because he was amazing that game which could have made Bulls win that game that MJ literally stole from Kukoc to airball it himself. Ridiculous shit if you ask me.

First of all, if you've never played Basketball GM, [give it a try](https://basketball-gm.com/), I think you might like it. It's a video game where you get to be the general manager of a pro basketball team, kind of like Football Manager or franchise mode in 2k. You sign players, draft players, make trades, manage the finances, and try not to get fired.

Most importantly: it's free. Actually free. That means no microtransactions or ""free to play"" or any kind of horrible corrupting nonsense like that.

If you've played Basketball GM before... listen, I'm not gonna lie to you. At its core, it's the same game it was a year ago. If you didn't like it then, you probably won't like it now. But if you did like it before, it's even better now! There have been a ton of small improvements, such as:

* More customization options in God Mode.

Whether it lasts will remain to be seen but as of right now they're knocking off heavyweights like the Cavs and Spurs like they're D-League teams and **bitch I am shook**.

**A-God** - This a real ass man right here.  He's young but he's got a big boy game now. Big dick shit only. Averaging 23 and 9 right now.  Please don't take him LA.  I swear to god.

**Vucci Mane** - This white boy right here is the truth.  We gotta make sure we get him in the racial draft next year before the race war.  Protect the Vooch

Orlando is mostly known as a vacation destination for people who think Olive Garden is fancy and Brazilian pickpockets.  Our two biggest celebrities of the past 10 years have been Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman.  [We are trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6BKGpPIi58) and honestly North Korea should just nuke us.  We'd thank them.  

You ever wanted to go to a 2 story Sizzler?  You ever wanted to see a guy smoke crack in the middle of a highway?  Well this is your kinda place then.  We're close to Miami so we got pretty good drugs, but beyond that we're trash as hell.

Which is why the Magic not being trash is so vital to our life.  When you live in the **tackiest city in the country** you gotta do waht you gotta do.  Orlando is what most philosophers call a ""Garbage city"".  As in, its garbage, the people are garbage, there's garbage everywhere, crackheads will piss on your car, everyone is like 57% suicidal, just don't ever come here.

“Spending 11 years in Oklahoma opened my eyes to the rich and sordid history of the state,” added Westbrook, referencing his stint as a player for the Oklahoma City Thunder. “When I learned about the heartbreaking events that happened in Tulsa nearly 100 years ago, I knew this was a story I wanted to tell.

I know this is more of a prime off-season post, however I believe I should post this here:

In the summer of 2018, I was a manager at my local movie theater (Central Florida area). I was 20 years old at the time, and I’ve always been a major fan of sports associations such as the NFL and NBA. For more context, I would consider myself someone with above-average knowledge on topics NBA-related. Anyways, one morning I was opening the building, and the janitor turned in a lost wallet that was found from the previous night. This was no ordinary wallet, as it was a checkered Louis Vuitton design with engraved initials. I tried looking to see if there was any contact information from the wallet, and I immediately spotted his name (If I ever lost my wallet, I would like if the person who found it contacted me).  I still can’t believe that he lost his wallet at this random movie theater outside of Orlando, FL during the off-season (The odds of the person knowing who he is and finding his wallet are probably wild). Continuing on, I was shocked and immediately tried to find ways to contact him on social media. I tried contacting Harkless and his manager on multiple platforms, until I finally received a response on Instagram (Picture #1). After talking back and forth via direct messages, I ended up sending out the wallet to his address, including a small letter displaying how much of a fan I was (I’m a magic fan and supported him when he was on the team). After he received the package, it took several days for a response, however he replied by telling me next time the trail blazers come in town to play the Magic, he will hook me up with two tickets as well as post game passes. I was so excited and ecstatic for something like this because I’m a huge fan of the Magic and I love to watch the blazers! I told all my family and friends what happened, and my girlfriend and I called out of work for that day so we could enjoy ourselves. Long story short, he ghosted me, and I never got those tickets. (Picture #3-#5).

Let me preface by saying that I don’t mind that he didn’t send anything in return for sending back his wallet. What I do mind is that he promised me something that he never went through with. Both me and my girl called out of work for this and I was so excited to go to the game and see what the post-game passes were all about. I’m a fan and this was a genuine let-down for me.

I’m still a fan of Maurice Harkless, and I’m glad to see he’s on a championship contender this year, however I am still extremely disappointed and upset in how he completely lied to me/ghosted me once he got the wallet (that I paid priority shipping for). 

TL;DR – Found Moe Harkless’ wallet and sent it back to him in the mail. He promised me tickets and post-game passes, however once he received the wallet in the mail, he ghosted me.

EDIT #1 : I was very cringey and perhaps a bit excessive with my messages, however I don’t apologize for trying to get his attention. 

EDIT #2 : I can see if he reads a message, and all of those final messages weren’t read. The only reason I sent those messages were basically to bump up our conversation.

EDIT #3 : bro!

EDIT #4 : thanks to those of you that are kind, i appreciate it! Several people are attacking me for “expecting a return” when the only reason I’m expecting something in return is because he said he would reward me. I’ve returned plenty of lost items before without a reward, but anyone would be disappointed if they were promised something that they didn’t receive.",0.75,top,12/4/19 18:22

KD tore his *right* Achilles... 

Kobe tore his left Achilles. DeMarcus Cousins? Left. Wes Matthews? Left. Rudy Gay? Left. ~~Brandon Jennings? Left.~~ Chauncey Billups? Left. Elton Brand? Left.

Dominique Wilkins... right.

I know it doesn't matter as much as one's dominant shooting hand, but it still affects which leg he takes off from when driving to his dominant side, etc. 

Granted, Dominique's game wasn't the EXACT same; he lost a decent bit of athleticism but he was so good he was able to adapt his game and still be an elite player. He didn't go above the rim as much and started shooting a lot more. KD doesn't rely exclusively on his athleticism; obviously his first step matters a lot and he's a great finisher, but KD should have a far easier time adapting if he loses some athleticism as his primary strengths are his scoring touch and shooting ability. He's still a 7 footer who can get off a shot from anywhere.

Time doesn’t wait on anyone so why should I waste my time on it ? Me cutting my hair was more than a cut. My hair was a mask of me hiding the insecurity’s that I felt the world wasn’t ready for.

Unfortunately, there is currently no statistic for how a player misses, so I am counting all of his misses as bricks.

Over Westbrook's career, he has missed 8,627 shots during the regular season so if my math is correct, that gives us 8,627 bricks.

There are at least 10 different brick sizes, but we are going to go with a [standard modular brick - 7 5/8"" x 2 1/4"".](https://imgur.com/a/JH6X319) We are going to plan for 7 bricks per sq. ft.

With the house being 1,350 sq.ft., the perimeter of the house would be approximately 154 linear feet (27′ x 50′). Multiply that by a height of 8 feet to get a total square wall footage of 1,232.

People go nuts whenever someone is at the line, especially if they miss the first shot.

So for the first time in all my years of going to Hawks games, someone missed two shots last night. Everyone was excited. Sure it's just a sandwich, but it gets people really hyped for the game.

On the way out, I asked an employee at State farm arena how we get our free sandwich voucher and she said they were out of them! The arena was at like half capacity to begin with, and there were still hundreds of people there. How are they going to say everyone gets and sandwich of they don't have enough for a half full game and there are still people inside?

Here's the Westbrook update: in OKC's last five games of the regular season, Westbrook will need to average roughly 5ppg/0rpg/4apg to average a 30-10-10 stat line.

He currently has 41 TDs ([7 consecutive TDs as of now](http://imgur.com/a/YwVjH)) and has [tied Oscar's triple double record](http://imgur.com/a/00b4f) and is one away from breaking it. 

Additionally, Westbrook has recorded a TD against 27 out of the 29 opposing teams (Portland and Chicago).

5 Game Totals for 30-10-10 stat line: 

- 2435/2460 points = 25 points=5ppg

- 820+ rebounds = ACCOMPLISHED=0rbg

- 804/820 assists = 16 assists=4apg

TL;DR: For a 30-10-10 stat line, Westbrook needs to average a 5ppg/0rpg/4apg stat line in his last 5 games.

Transcript of the text:

> Lou Williams: I didn't talk him out of killing me. Once he said what he said, I came up with a solution, but I didn't talk him out of it. Once he said what he said, I didn't tell him ""aye man, wait.” Story is, I was at the barbershop.....I get my hair cut in the hood. 22nd and Indiana in the hood. My security was with me at the barbershop. We leave the barbershop, I'm at the light. He called me and he said ""you good?” I said ""yea I'm straight.” He said ""alright good.” I watched him do a U turn behind me and pull off. I reached down and started playing with my phone sitting at the light. I look up and hear a knock at the window. I look up, dude got the gun. I don't know why I didn't get out the car......I should have got out the car, but instinctively I rolled the window down.........I rolled the window down and he told me to get out the car. We made eye contact and he said “Damn Lou, I can't even do it to you.' He just said 'Damn Lou, I can't even do it to you.' The next thing he said was 'man as much as you do for the city. As much as you do for the neighborhood, I can't even do you like that.' So what ended up happening is - in North Philly - again I am a dreamchaser. I've known Meek before the world knew Meek. When it was cold out, we would give out coats and sweaters. We did it out of pocket. Going to Burlington coat factory ourselves. Pulling up in Uhaul trucks and pulling stuff out......we used to do these things. Camps in the summertime. It was just a community that embraced me. This dude was from that community. He said ""I just got out of jail, I'm hurting. I'm hungry. All I got is this gun” So I look around and there's a McDonalds right there and I told him ""bro, if you pull in, lets go in and I'll buy you anything you want to eat.” It wasn't like he robbed me and then we got in the car. I just told him that I will buy him whatever. And that's what I did.....we sat there and chopped it up. He was just like ""I'm down and out out here."" I told him ""bro I get it, but this ain't the way.""

111,NBA 400 3-Pointer Challenge Completed in 2:45 w/Proof,14302,6swm2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6swm2g/nba_400_3pointer_challenge_completed_in_245_wproof/,1089,1502430194,"**I lived to tell the tale of 400 NBA 3’s!!**

A few days ago I saw the [400 NBA three pointer challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6rzyc6/youre_locked_in_a_gym_and_need_to_make_400_threes/). No food, no drink, just 400 made NBA threes or death. Something about the challenge spoke to me, so I decided to give it a go. I bought a GoPro camera and headed to the gym. 

I’m 42 and consider myself a good shot. I live next to a rec center and go shoot there once a month or so. I quit basketball after my sophomore year of high school and haven’t played 5 on 5 basketball in 20 years. I’ve never shot on a court with a NBA three point line. 

Without any food, drink, bathroom breaks, or leaving the frame of the camera (except for a few long rebounds), I finished the challenge in 2 hours 45 minutes. I shot almost exactly 50% (400 / 804). 

* [12 Minute Highlight Video with a few comments after each 100](https://youtu.be/F0qRdeOsYR8)

* [10 straight makes (shots 121 - 130)](https://youtu.be/xdobqrE1A3Q)

**Stats:**

* First 100 makes took 180 shots (55.56%)

* Second 100 took 167 shots (59.88%)

* Third 100 took 224 shots (44.64%)

* Fourth 100 took 233 shots (42.92%)

* Airballs: 2 (including my 3rd from last shot)

* Made streaks of 10,9,8,7,5,5,5,5,5
* Longest cold streak: 8
* Hottest Streak: Made 30/38 (79%) to start my second 100. 

It was hard. Kind of like running a half marathon hard. I was for sure thirsty, especially at the beginning before I settled in. I had a feeling the third 100 would suck, and it did. It was the “maybe I should quit” 100. Once you get past 300, you’re in it until the end. 

I have the entire event recorded and could put it all up on Youtube if there are any doubters. I pledge on my grandmother’s soul that I never left the gym, ate food, or had a drink. I took a 1-2 minute break each 100, where I talked to the camera for a moment. 

So, until proven otherwise by a well-documented attempt, I consider myself the world record holder in the NBA Subreddit 400. Two hours forty five.

113,Why Derrick Rose is the most overrated player of this Decade,10,acd3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/acd3ek/why_derrick_rose_is_the_most_overrated_player_of/,142,1546595715,"Derrick Rose is famous for being the youngest MVP ever. Rose is also infamous for being extremely injury prone. 

Due to Rose's injuries he has gained lots of sympathy over the years. Most of it is deserved, he was an MVP level player whose career got ruined by injuries. 

Rose has always had a large fan base over the years, and because of his injury history, no one really talked negatively about him. (besides injury jokes) 

I have always believed Rose to be overrated, and for little good reason it has always made me annoyed and angry when people talk about him like he was going to be Michael Jordan if he didn't get injured. 

I have kept my stance to myself over the years, since there is no real need for me to bash on a player who hasn't been relevant or healthy for years. 

But this All-Star voting result has pushed me over the edge. 

I get it. It's a popularity contest. Dwayne Wade is #2 in the East, and Kobe Bryant was an all-star starter in a year he was awful. And Rose has been having a comeback season and it is impressive he is playing at a high level after what seemed like the end of his career. 

But I'm here to tell you that it's all good ole nostalgia that is blinding you from the fact that Rose wasn't as good as everyone makes him out to be. 

Let's look at Rose's MVP season, his stats were;
25 PPG, 7.7 APG, 4.1 RPG, 1 SPG, 0.6 BPG, 13.1 Win Shares. 

Since Rose's MVP season in 2010-2011, (last 8 years in the NBA, not including this year), there have been 18 other instances of players averaging a stat line of;
23+ PPG, 5+ APG, 4+ RPG, 13 Win Shares

Those players are;
Lebron (6), Harden (4), Curry (3), Durant (2), Westbrook (2), Butler (1) 

Out of those 19 instances (18 + Rose's MVP season), here are Rose's ranks in each of the following categories;

PPG: 15th
RPG: 19th
APG: Tied 7th 
Win Shares: Tied 18th
SPG: Tied 18th
BPG: Tied 8th
TPG: Tied 6th 
FG%: 15th
3P%: 16th
FT%: Tied 9th
TS%: 19th
PER: 19th
ORTG: 18th
DRTG: Tied 5th 
USG%: 7th 


My point is, Derrick Rose had one great year, which when compared to other MVP caliber players the past decade, wasn't even that great. 

I understand that he was young and had potential to get better, but he is put on a pedestal by some people that he doesn't deserve. 

Jimmy Butler's 2016-2017 year with the Bulls;
23.9 PPG, 5.5 APG, 6.2 RPG 1.9 SPG, 0.4 BPG, 13.8 Win Shares 
Is extremely similar to Rose's MVP season, and I would expect nothing but laughter if I were to ever compare the two in their prime. 

All stats according to Basketball Reference.

EDIT: Understand, I'm not saying anything about whether the call was correct or not. Just pondering how 50/50 calls and luck are so crucial but often forgotten. Whether it was a travel or not, the refs need to be more consistent. [Here is an example just from these playoffs](https://youtu.be/rmG8jPo4_Wc?t=176). Late in the game, 40 seconds left, Bulls are down 1 and go up 1 because of this missed call. Jimmy plants his right foot for the spin and the video shows it clearly takes another step.

Now seeing his effort and Stats throughout the finals I feel comfortable and I think some people will agree with me when I say this.

**ALL DURANT CAN DO EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IS SCORE** 

* Dude is almost 7 feet tall and averaging less then 6 rebounds per game. Last night he had 2 rebounds which is absolutely embarrassing. 

*  He has no court vision. Can't remember the last time I've been amazed by a pass he's thrown, most of his assists come from a jumpshot made by a team mate who happens to be open. He is averaging less then 2 assists for the finals 

* He usually gives a half ass effort trying to get open when a play is drawn for him. I've seen wade who is much shorter then him body him into a terrible position many times. Since Durant can't manage to get open its usually westbrook who has to jack up a terrible shot.

* It has been exposed that Durant is a below average defender. His Mistakes just get erased because he has Serge and Perkins lurking in the paint to stop drives and block shots. Melo is usually called out for his defense but Durant's is worse. I've never seen Melo have to be switched off a man.

I think people who have watched the NBA back in the day will agree when I say that Durant is a watered down prime T-Mac.

Edit: So none of you have actually tried to counter my points and went on about how he's young, and can score and all that. Derrick Rose, Dwight, Rondo, Kevin Love, Westbrook, Griffin etc, are all young and can score. But they bring more to the table then just that. Which is my point.

Doctors cleared him WEEKS ago. Could you imagine telling your boss you're not going to work even though the doctor said you're not sick anymore? What do you think would happen?

Not that it's game related, but Adidas spent a pretty penny pushing #thereturn, which was clearly just throwing a bunch of cash in the trashcan as there will not be a return.

His teammates play like warriors and give up their bodies and risk injury every night. Every athlete does. Kobe blew the ankle and at least TRIED before coming out of the game. He's supposedly practicing full speed, I'd be pissed if I was his teammate. 

Those same teammates are going to have the Bulls with a very respectable record and in the playoffs without him. Take any other MVP candidate off their team and tell me if you get a similar result (excluding the Heat).

And my all-time favorite: 'the all-star game is not a place for smiling and dancing'. Dude, get over yourself. I know this one has nothing to do with the actual game, but it really made me dislike him.

Almost every single play Bogut sets a screen where he is obviously moving.  It's gotten so rdiculous that he straight up bear hugged Anthony Davis and then, the very next play, grabbed Omer Asik's jersey to the point where it stretch out like a flag.  Both players were in correct defensive position and were so blatantly hindered from making their rotation by Bogut.  Those plays led to an And 1 and a dunk.

I don't expect players to play it clean every play or for refs to catch them every time, but this isn't ""heady basketball,"" or ""using an advantage.""  Those are used when a player gets away with something once a game.  Bogut does stuff like this the majority of the time he is out there.  What he is doing is straight up illegal, and it's ruining the games when the refs don't call it.

The moving screen is impossible to defend because it turns a passive obstacle into an active one.  NBA players are hard enough to defend with somebody acting as an offensive linemen, taking multiple steps to try and hinder your progress.  Holding is even worse, for obvious reasons.  And watching the Warriors, Bogut gets away with this stuff probably 10-20 times a game.

I don't see any possible way that NBA refs can be so consistently bad at calling this stuff.  Something else is happening, because they are definitely turning a blind eye.  An official was looking right at the Bogut/Davis bearhug, called nothing, AD threw a fit (as he should), and 24 second later they ignored another blatant hold.

This isn't an argument that the Pelicans deserved to win, and I'm not a fan of either team, so I have no dog in this fight.  I want to watch good, playoff, basketball.  When I see one of the easiest calls in the game botched over and over and over again, and there's only one perpetrator, it absolutely takes away the entire viewing experience.  I feel cheated that I put a ton of time and money into being a fan this year, and now the league appears to letting a player foul at will without fear of being called for it.

This is ridiculous.  Watch one of Steph's highlight videos, you're bound to see at least 5-6 blatant offensive fouls by Bogut.  If he was doing it every now and again, I'd shrug my shoulders because stuff like that happens.  But, he's doing it consistently.  Game in, game out.  His fouls have to be accounting for significant swings in scoring, as they often lead to baskets (why they're illegal in the first place).  And NBA refs are doing nothing.  I refuse to believe in an NBA that called more offensive fouls on AD than Bogut got in the entire game.  I really don't fault Bogut all that much either.  If they're letting him play like that, he's be a numbskull not to exploit it.

Shameless.  This reeks of WWE and kingmaking by the league.  Different commissioner, same shady shit.  The NBA obviously cares more about profits than the integrity of the game, which is pathetic.

5) There will be no Kardashiam curse, as none of the Clipper players have that kind of game. Ben Simmons on the other hand is a goner.

6) CP3's trade actually gave us some assets, which none of us care about long term. Let's give SA the entire team for Kawhi. Who cares either way at this point?

7) Lebron has encountered racism in the past... Clippers happens to be one of the few team to undergo a public transformation in this regard. We are now a safe zone.

124,[Translation] A more moderate analysis from a Chinese NBA fan,20,dezi8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dezi8p/translation_a_more_moderate_analysis_from_a/,299,1570567841,"Hi all, I think this post contributes to the conversation by    providing insight into how an average NBA fan in China thinks about the issue. You probably won't agree with a lot of it, but I've always believed that in conflicts like this, instead of discussing within one community, it brings value to better understand how/why the other side takes its stand.

I wanted to share one of the most upvoted response to the question ""How do the clarifying statements from NBA and Morey influence this incident?"", with Redditors who might be interested. This is one of the more moderate reactions (instead of the more extremely nationalist answers). Texts in the parenthesis below are notes of my own.

Original link is from ""Zhihu"", a Chinese site similar to Quora: https://www.zhihu.com/question/349482593/answer/847926460
Disclaimer: The following is excerpted and my translation might not convey the original article in 100% accuracy. 

**Edit: This post understandably became very controversial. I didn't mean to spread ""propaganda"", but I hoped to share how this well-educated Chinese NBA fan took his stand, after analyzing both American and Chinese values.** I think there's value in understanding the other side in a debate. And the other side in this issue aren't all just extreme nationalist crying ""NMSL"". If you don't want to read the original article, I provided some thoughts of my own below and maybe that's more interesting to you. To those of you who did find this thread with interesting information, thanks for the comments and this is reason I translated this article for.

""""""

*To understand NBA's statement, we need to first figure out ""the why"" behind it.*

*In a times of vibrant globalization of NBA, with China being its biggest partner (overseas), the public outburst and conflicts on this issue have grown explosively. The NBA however is making a superficial, ambiguous statement, trying to convert a political discussion into a cultural one.* 

*It's no surprise.*

*I never expected the NBA to issue any fines on Morey, nor will Rockets fire him even if the owner wanted to.* 

*Obviously in this issue, politics position outweighs right or wrong. For China, we have our bottom line (in diplomatic matters related to Hong Kong), while the US has its own political correctness. As the ""candle-stick"" country (this is an interesting reference to US, not sure if the context is clear. Basically it refers to the Book of Mathew in Bible and teases US for its propaganda of western values), the US has its mainstream values and always tries to measure other nation's reality with their own culture and beliefs.* 

*Look at Reddit (yup the author has VPN, as does many others netizens): considerable of American netizens voice support for Morey, just because he advocates ""democracy"" for ""people"", but without realizing Morey offended our sovereignty greatly. They think he just voices an opinion of his and what's wrong with that?*

*In reality, this so-called freedom has evolved into violence. The long-term living conditions of the ""people"" they support, the US doesn't care to understand and this is their arrogance (he's arguing that some American folks just follow the trend without really understand the issue of HK).*

*Thus, it's not hard to understand the attitude of NBA.*

*In US, as long as the bottom line of racial and sexual discrimination is not touched, it's illegal to fine people on their words because of freedom of speech. The NBA in recent years has also been encouraging their stars to comment on progressive affairs, in order to boast its own social and political value. They won't contradict themselves by punishing Morey.*

*If NBA criticizes Morey or Fertitta fires him, this will cause the public opinion to say that ""they chose money over freedom"" or ""does the NBA have the right to take away its employees' opinions?"" Granted they might fear the loss of Chinese market, but the American market is the fundamentals of NBA. It goes without saying which one is prioritized. Thus, Fertitta's saying ""We have the best GM in the league"" (This was taken out of context; I think it was wording before a turn of tone but it's taken as defense for Morey) is not because he ignores the seriousness of the issue, but it's the inevitable development of events.*

*So what's our take on this? I personally think we should stand with what the leadership decides to take.*

*If the state does not ban NBA, it's also not necessary for us to keep bashing (Morey and NBA). Only the uncultured and the boorish shout “perish together” to their end. The NBA is very closely knitted with China's sports industry, be it forums, media, reporters or sports company. Many count on NBA as their income.* 

*I've said this in a group chat, a nation has to protect its sovereignty to develop, but it doesn't mean pushing it too hard.* 

*I don't have the relevant numbers and stats for the sports industry, and don't have a think tank to report on cost-benefit analysis. But I trust that after a full day's silence, the State has a more accurate estimate of developments on this matter, and has planned accordingly. Whether it's forgiving concession or a heavy punch to the NBA, we shall wait and see.*

*Another way to understand this is by thinking in their shoes: if you partner with US but sends a tweet that insults African American, and try to say that ""my country has freedom of speech, and my views do not represent my company"", this most definitely won't be accepted by Americans.*

*At the end of this, one has to contemplate: under David Stern, the Houston Rockets became the barometer and milestone of NBA's Chinese market. This was why the issue was so destructive. Also, if it happened during a less subtle time (China's National Day is Oct 1st), or on a less sensitive topic (sovereignty), or a less important person (GM of the most popular NBA team in China), this matter wound't have expanded like this.*

*Perhaps, the biggest victim in this incident are the Chinese fans who devoted their love to Rockets and NBA.* 

""""""

Tl;dr: Explains why the NBA releases an ambiguous statement since it's bound by western values but still values Chinese market. Provides context of Western universal values and how it clashes with China's sovereignty issues. Points out that ban of NBA harms both sides. Explains why this particular issue exploded so dramatically.

My thoughts: 

1) The author clearly understands a fair amount of American cultural contexts, and explains on the issue from both nations' cultural and political beliefs. It‘s actually a good education for the Chinese public on why the NBA/Rockets/American fans react in their ways. Hopefully this brings more meaningful conversations on this Chinese forum.

2) Has a very good point: China doesn't want to just permanently cut ties because of conflict since China's sports industry also suffers damage if the NBA doesn't flourish in the country.

3) Ultimately I see two clashing fundamental beliefs on the topic freedom of speech. In Western values you can say anything about politics as long as it doesn't touch racial or sexual discrimination. In China, it's deemed the freedom of speech does not protect speech that ""undermines national sovereignty"". The rest of world knows how China is ""petty"" on issues like this, but they might not understand is that China and its netizens treats its sovereignty issues just as seriously as the west treats racial issues. Territorial integrity is its fundamental value and is indoctrinated from grade school, just as racial equality is taught in US educational system. And it's a very successful strategy: *not everyone* agrees with the government's ways, but *everyone* gets fired up on territorial issues. Most Chinese fans genuinely  think it's a double standard to not allow someone criticize a specific race, but supporting ""separatist movement"" is allowed. 
But that's what freedom of speech is, a western person might say. This is why this clash of ideas is so fundamental.

4) In his last sentence, you can tell he really believes the Chinese fans are heart-broken by this issue, despite their angry reactions. And in a way it's true. The NBA has been a progressive, positive influence in China, and even educates the public on matters like racial equality. Fans really treat their franchise players as inspiring role models, and devote lots of emotions into the team. And now out of nowhere Morey posted this comment that's deemed outrageous in the country, and both fanbase despise each other in heated argument, with possibility of NBA being banned. There's definitely emotional loss there. 

For me, the NBA and the Rockets have been great ambassadors (like it or not) in modern China-US relationship due to the influence. It's sad to see them entangled in this position.

Not arguing for any side through this post; meant to share this for some insights. Please correct me on anything that I got wrong. Note: this Zhihu response was obviously written before China goes all in and announces suspension of NBA broadcast, while the OP predicted a less aggressive reaction from the leadership. I can make an update on newest fans sentiment, if anyone is interested.",0.53,controversial,10/8/19 13:50

Clutch moments exist, hitting a game winning shot is in fact clutch.  But clutch players do not - just good / great ones who we mistake their greatness for clutchness.  

&#x200B;

The science suggests that these events are overrated in our memory because there are so few of them and the stakes are much higher that the results from these events stick with us longer and remain more meaningful to our perception.  But that's just a human limitation - not anything real.  Hitting a big shot in a big moment is more of a product of randomness than anything.  With such small sample sizes nothing meaningful can be truly derived from the data, especially without the full picture (i.e. the context behind each attempt).  When these samples grow the picture becomes clearer - the best players tend to perform the best no matter the situation.

With all that said I'll leave this data here...a players TS% during ""clutch"" moments from one year to the next (2010-2019).  If clutch were real, wouldn't it be repeatable?

They're exactly who you would consider clutch too - Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Al Horford, Ray Allen, Gordon Hayward, Samuel Dalembert, Amir Johnson, Julius Randle, Kyle Korver, Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, Derrick Favors, and Markieff Morris.  A veritable who's who of the most clutch players in the game.  Or, in all actuality, guys who have limited years (who will eventually fall victim to the random output of ""clutch"" time statistics) or players who were still incredibly inconsistent but are so GD good at shooting that it's hard for them to fall below average (Steph, anyone?).  

&#x200B;

The point is, clutch players don't really exist.  If they did, they could do it over and over and over and we would find it in the data - but it's not there.  I know that many sports fans treasure the idea of players being clutch, so it's hard to admit reality when you don't want to.  But that doesn't make it any less true.  Sorry.    


*\*Clutch time is based on a game with less than 5 minutes to go and is within +/- 5 points\**

128,Debunking narratives about the Warriors-Rockets 2018 Western Conference finals,114,g7tgd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g7tgd9/debunking_narratives_about_the_warriorsrockets/,306,1587849830,"Disclaimer:I am a Knicks fan not a Warriors fan not a Rockets fan I never was a blind hatrer towards Stephen Curry or James Harden and appreciate their greatness, Klay Thompson and PJ Tucker are some of my favorite players as well. Full disclosure I watched every single game and wanted the Rockets to win the series so if that disqualifies me from being what I consider a non-bias observer I’ll take the L. 

To some people narratives are more important than what actually happened. You make a comment you think is noncontroversial next thing you know you have -50 downvotes because it went against a popular narrative. With how some people in the NBA media and Reddit talk about certain events it’s like they didn’t even watch the same game as you. The 2017-18 Rockets had an historic offense and one of the better defenses in the league. They didn’t have the star power Golden State had but they had the right pieces around 2 all NBA caliber players. I’m going to quote some of the popular narratives against this team and attempt to debunk them.

#”Rockets went 0-27 they deserve to lose”

Point 1: even going 0-27 the game was within 6 points with five minutes left in the fourth quarter until Steve Kerr did Hack-a-Capella and the game got out of hand.

Point 2: Why did they shoot so many threes despite them not falling? Because the refereeing, I am NOT arguing if the refs are bias I am trying to stick to only the facts. You can argue with whether bad calls are part of the game and they happen all the time it’s a physical game. What you cannot argue is that refereeing does not affect the outcome of the game. The Rockets were not getting many calls in their favor game 7. The warriors were very physical in the paint this made the Rockets three point shots or attack the basket strategy harder because the Warriors were getting away with contact. That’s what led to the decision of shooting so many threes. Personally I wish James Harden was unleashed and had the green light to shoot mid range shots this game, he used to be elite at it when he took them, and the Warriors defense wouldn’t have game planned around it but this is hindsight. In the moment you probably don’t wanna deviate from what got you there. Also there was a four Point play in the third quarter that was waived off Harden MADE a 3.

Minor point:[There was 4 three point fouls](https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU) on James Harden that game that was missed and if the fouls were called those attempts wouldn’t have counted. I cannot recall if it happened to any other player but I vividly remember it happening to Harden. Missed fouls are a part of the game yes but if there’s a nuanced for that why can’t there be nuanced for 0-27.

#“yeah Chris Paul was injured games seven but Andre Iguodala was injured too. If Andre Iguodala  was healthy it wouldn’t have gone seven”

Point 1: Andre Iguodala was vital to the Warriors One of the best six men in the league at the time and could’ve helped guard Harden yes. However it is absolutely idiotic to compare all star and all NBA caliber player Chris Paul 1 of the best point guards in history and one of the smartest to a 6th man. Chris Paul was the 2nd most important player to the Rockets at best Andre Iguodala 5th most important. But OK let me debunk this one by comparing how each team performed without each player. 

Warriors Playoffs offensive rating when Andre Iguodala is in the game:111.9 

Warriors Playoffs defensive Rating when Andre Iguodala is in the game:98.5

Warriors Offensive rating games 3-7 no Iggy: 109.725(-2.185)

Warriors Defensive rating games 3–7 no Iggy: 101.5(+? 3)

Rockets Playoffs Offensive rating when Cp3 is in the game 109.1

Rockets Playoffs defensive Rating when CP3 is in the  game:102.3

Rockets offensive rating game 6-7 without Chris Paul 96.85(-13.85)

Rockets Defensive rating game 6-7 without Chris Paul 117.15(+?14.85) 

The Warriors without Andre Iguodala were 2.185 points worse without him offensively and 3 points worse defensively. Compare that to the Rockets without Chris Paul 13.85 points worse offensively and 14.85 points worse defensively. It’s laughable to compare the impact of Andre Iguodala to the impact of Chris Paul which leads me to my next point.

Point 2: Why do people pretend like CP3 and Iggy were the only injured players that series? Luc Richard Mbah a Moute unfortunately got injured right before the playoffs and it was never the same. He played some games in the playoffs but it was a shell of himself and because of that it forced the Rockets to play Ryan Anderson. According to advance stats he was the Rockets best defender out of all rotation players who got serious minutes. He and Trevor Ariza had similar importance to the Rockets and he played a vital role in their defense.  Let’s compare all of the injured players stats. Unlike Andre Iguodala and Chris Paul, whose stats were better in the playoffs then in the regular season, I will be using regular season stats for LMaM because injury.

Luc Richard Mbah a Moute Regular season stats:
7.5/3/.9/1.2/.3 on 48.1/36.4/68.4 Win shares 2.8 defensive win shares 2.1 usage 12.8% defensive rating 101.7 and offensive rating 111.4 25.6 minutes a game.

Andre Iguodala playoff stats: 8.1/4.5/2.7/1.4/.5 on 49.4/37.8/70.6 spilts Win shares 1.4 Defensive win shares .7 usage rate of 12.4% defensive Rating of 98.5 and offensive rating of 111.9 26.7 minutes a game.

Chris Paul Playoff stats: 21.1/5.9/5.8/2/.3 WS 2.1 DWS .7 on 45.9/37.4/83 Usage rate 26.2% Offensive rating 109.1 and Defensive Rating 102.3 34.5 minutes game.

According to the stats Andre Iguodala impact was more closer to Luc Richard Mbah they played a similar amount of minutes had a similar usage rate and offensive rating. Iguodala has a better defense of rating and better stats but LMaM had more win shares. Meaning the Rockets lost their second best player and a player who had similar production to Iggy. It’s completely ridiculous to say injuries are awash in the series.

#“The Rockets blew a 3-2 lead Harden is a choker and he can’t lead his team to a championship”

The 2018 Warriors are one of the greatest NBA teams in history that had four All-Stars(Draymonds last year). 2 of the greatest shooters of all time one of which was a top 5 player and 2xMVP with another pretty good shooter who was 7 feet tall and a top 5 MVP player. The Rockets had 1 MVP top 5 player James Harden A 6 man of the year and a bunch of role players(2 of which I’d argue cost them game 7 Ryan Anderson and Clint Capela with FT). It would be ridiculous to think that they could have beaten one of the greatest teams of all time and the craziest thing is they almost did. Let’s only take into account the 4 3 point fouls [that in the moment even the announcers thought were missed fouls](https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU). Including a four-point play that was waived off. Harden is a 88.7% FT shooter so let’s say that’s a possible 11-12/13 extra points the Rockets get final score could’ve been 101-103/4 and that’s not even factoring in points the Warriors lost from fast break opportunities from fouls not being called(IE Klay’s 3 after a miss foul on harden) or game momentum possibly shifting. I’m not arguing if the refs are biased I’m arguing the facts there were missed calls and it cost the Rockets the game. 

Point 2: if the Rockets beat the Warriors which they very much could’ve they are 100% washing the Cavs. The Cavs defense was horrible and it was arguably one of the worst teams ever to make the finals if it wasn’t for LeBron. I’m pretty sure even though Harden hasn’t won a championship you can say he is a caliber player to get you one, he wasn’t just one game away he was a few calls away.

#“Kevin Durant was hurt last year he has no excuses and it proves the Rockets we’re never going to be able to beat the Warriors they need to stop saying if CP3 didn’t get hurt”

I remember hearing that one from Rachel Nichols 

Point 1: Here is the facts you can have the same core and be a worse team. Teams are not stagnant players become better players become worse. Rockets lost Trevor Ariza and LMaM, NeNe was old as hell last year, Chris Paul had a down year, Eric Gordon might have declined, Capela played worse last year. As a result of The Rockets personnel downgrade their switch everything strategy didn’t work and their defense was so much worse than the year before. You also had a owner who was unwilling to improve the team by going into luxury tax. 

Point 2: If it wasn’t for James Harden doing something incredible by going on a rampage and caring his team I doubt the Rockets would have even been in a game 6 against the Warriors. If James harden just replicated his production from his MVP season You could argue that Rockets team doesn’t even make the playoffs with all the injuries and downgrades. I am not trying to disparage LeBron for this next point, I just want to highlight how insane Harden went. Harden did something LeBron couldn’t do that year take a injured team in the west that year to the playoffs Harden elevated the Rockets from the 14th Seed into top 4(if it wasn’t for the nuggets would’ve been 3 1 game from 2)while recovering from an injury. Harden having a historic season included  having the second most steals that season with the most deflections, while averaging the most points since MJ (36)with a 32 game streak of 30+ points. including moments like the game against the Warriors with no CP3 where he hit a clutch three point shot to win the game against Draymond and Klay. Going 21-11 despite Chris Paul and Clint Capela missing time during that stretch season as well. One of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen in a regular season and it completely masked a lot of the Rockets flaws.

Point 3: Now more specifically games 6 You had Andre Iguodala score 17 points on 62.5% from 3 game 6 Klay and Steph going god mode in the second half. Steph scored 33 points 25 in the fourth quarter. Sometimes there is nothing you can do and the better team wins it and the warriors were the better team this year. If it wasn’t for Klay’s injury they could’ve beaten the Raptors and won a championship without Kevin Durant. They were a championship caliber team with or without Kevin Durant there is no shaming and losing to them.

Bonus narratives not related to this series specifically but I’m not making another post for these and might as well address them 

###“Harden sucks at defense”

He is one of the best post defenders in the league was top 5 in steals twice at the very least he’s average to above average.

People don’t seem to take my word for it and they shouldn’t I should’ve elaborated but I got lazy toward the end 

These stats are accurate from March 16, 2019 I am still looking for the end of year stats from 2019

Pts per possession: 1st

FG%: 2nd

eFG% 2nd

Turnover frequency: 1st

Scoring frequency: 1st

This is from this year

[Harden has allowed just 0.65 points per post-up in 2019-20, the second-best mark of 50 players with at least 50 post possessions defended. ](https://www.si.com/nba/rockets/features/grading-james-harden-defensive-performance) He's also been an effective pick-and-roll defender. Harden allows just 0.78 points when defending the ball-handler in a PnR, ranking 31st of the 164 qualified players. Houston often schemes Harden away from the league's top guards, but that caveat doesn't dismiss the metrics. Harden has been an effective defender for significant stretches this season.

###“Harden chokes all the time”

I am not going to pretend Harden does not have bad playoff games he does he has historically bad games at times and has chocked. but all the time? what is choking? If Having a bad game equals choking did Steph Curry choke in game 3 in the 2018 finals? I’d argue no bad games come and go you should look at the totality of the series/playoffs. Some people say Harden choked in the playoffs last year. Harden averaged 34.83/7/5.5/2.16/.5 against the Warriors I don’t know what else he could’ve done that series. Did he have a few turnovers? yeah but if you think a few turnovers was the reason the Rockets lost to the Warriors not the fact that they were inferior team and “harden choked” I don’t know what to say to convince you otherwise. The last time he chocked was game 6 against San Antonio (i’ve heard arguments that he had a concussion but since we don’t have any medical evidence we have to assume it was a choke).",0.57,controversial,4/25/20 14:23

130,Unpopular Opinion: I don't like Tim Duncan,36,4sl13t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4sl13t/unpopular_opinion_i_dont_like_tim_duncan/,119,1468408685,"Title says it all. 

1. I hate that he whines after every call that either (a) doesn't go his way; or (b) goes against him. Especially the face he makes when whining about those calls. 

2. I've always thought he was a boring player (perhaps that's more indicative of the Spurs system from 1999-2011 or so, but I still blame Tim Duncan). Given his boring play, I've never said ""I can't wait to watch Tim Duncan tonight."" Yet even though I dislike other players, such as Lebron, I'm damn sure tuning in to watch him play. 

3. I've always felt like he was incredibly lucky with the situation he was in. For example, if the Spurs had traded their first pick in 1997 (which was used to draft Tim Duncan) for Kevin Garnett, I do not think Tim Duncan becomes ""Tim Duncan."" Given his quiet nature, I doubt his ability to single-handedly carry a franchise like Garnett did in Minnesota. Meanwhile, if Garnett is surrounded by the talent Duncan was during the 2000's, he wins multiple MVP's and more championships than Duncan during that era. 

4. He is friends with Bruce Bowen.

5. While I believe that he is probably more humble than the average NBA player, I think he received the ""humble"" label predominately because of his boring on-court play and the fact that the Spurs, despite winning, were rarely given national attention during the 2000's because they were so boring to watch. Had he played in a major media market, ala Kobe, Iverson, etc., he would likely have received more media scrutiny. With more scrutiny, he might act out in ways that we wouldn't expect (like Durant when he began to receive more media pressure). 

That's all I can think of. Maybe I'm irrational, but although I respect his accomplishments and think he was an excellent player, I'm just not a fan of Tim Duncan. Does that make me a bad person? Am I going to hell?",0.54,controversial,7/13/16 4:18

Well, I'm sorry to say, but this ""s*** team"" is Lebron's fault.

After the 2015 NBA Finals, Lebron used his leverage against the front office to re-sign Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson. Iman Shumpert signed for 4 years/40 million (!) dollars. Tristan Thompson was re-signed by the Cavs for 5 years/82 million (!) dollars. This contract is especially crazy because the Cavs were essentially competing against no other teams to sign Thompson. According to this CBS Sports article (2), not a single team stepped forward with a max offer sheet for Thompson to use as leverage in negotiations. Lebron took away all of his GM’s negotiating ability and it resulted in more than 290 million dollars in guaranteed money being handed out that offseason (3). This happened again in the 2016 NBA offseason when Lebron used his leverage once again to give out a 4 year/57 million (!) dollar contract to J.R. Smith. Lebron James has a penchant for getting his teammates exorbitant sums of money with no regard for his team’s future salary cap situation.

Sure, these contracts worked in the short term as the Cavs won the 2016 NBA championship but these contracts are rearing their ugly heads now and have resulted in this “s*** team” around Lebron.

According to Brian Windhorst while appearing on the Lowe Post, Lebron was especially bothered by the Cavs not trading for either Paul George or Eric Bledsoe this past offseason (4). As tempting as it is taking on either Tristan Thompson making 16.4 million dollars this season or J.R. Smith making 13.8 million dollars, both the Suns and the Pacers made the right decision and passed. Lebron cannot be mad at the Cavs front office because he was the one that hampered them in the first place. There was no way the Cavs were going to put the best offer on the table for either player due to Lebron’s own front office decisions.

We can even go back to Lebron’s heat days where he urged the Heat to trade up to draft Shabazz Napier (5). Now, Napier has played well for the Trail Blazers in their 3 guard lineup but his Heat tenure was very disappointing. Shabazz averaged 19.8 minutes while playing for the Heat with 5.1 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per contest. He was traded to the Magic after one season for a 2016 second-round pick. I hate doing this but if you look back at the 2014 NBA draft, the very next person to go was Clint Capela with Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kyle Anderson following soon after. Lebron struck again by acting as the GM and ended up wasting a first round pick on a player the Heat had no use for. 

Lebron is no doubt going to go down as one of the greatest players to ever play the game but should go down as one of the worst GM’s as well. This “s*** team” is the result of Lebron’s own short sighted GM moves. 

TL;DR: Lebron should never again partake in front office decisions because nearly every front office decision he has impacted has turned out poorly. This is especially seen with this current inferior Cavs supporting cast since the front office was in a bind against the salary cap due to Lebron influenced decisions from years ago.

135,Analysis of LeBron’s five fouls in game 5,76,26rnkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/26rnkg/analysis_of_lebrons_five_fouls_in_game_5/,343,1401375293,"Analysis of LeBron’s five fouls in game 5

###The [first foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=41) was called by Ken Mauer at 6:12 first quarter (5:48 into the game).

Paul George tries to split Bosh and LeBron and is tripped. When I watch the video it looks like LeBron’s left knee catches George’s left leg as LeBron swivels. We would need an angle from the endline to say for sure.

###The [second foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=64) was called by Ken Mauer at 2:43 first quarter (3:29 later).

This is the type of foul that is hard to understand by fans. The key here is that LeBron never established Legal Guarding Position, or LGP. The rules define certain things that must take place in order to *establish* Legal Guarding Position (in the path of offensive player, getting to the spot first, getting to the spot without contact to an opponent), certain things that the defender *can* do once they have LGP (move laterally or obliquely, move the feet, have feet off ground, etc), and certain things that causes the defender to *lose* LGP (moving forward, leaving the path of the offensive player, etc).

In this case **LeBron never established initial Legal Guarding Position**. He  was never in Hill's path before Hill started upward motion to shoot or pass.

When a player does not have Legal Guarding Position, **the amount of contact does not matter**. All the referee needs to decide is 1) if the player had legal position, and 2) if not, did the contact disadvantage the offensive player. The referee decided this contact disadvantaged Hill, and thus cannot be incidental or marginal contact. *I think we need an endline angle on this play as well.

Check out my other posts on Legal Guarding Position where I go into much more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1wcbfw/durant_and1/cf0s6ym), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1yo65t/duke_defeats_syracuse_6660_in_cameron/cfmp3qw), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1yo65t/duke_defeats_syracuse_6660_in_cameron/cfmoqdw).

###The [third foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=152) was called by Ed Malloy at 6:03 second quarter (8:40 later).

This is also a Legal guarding Position play. If Paul George *has* established position (got to the spot) before LeBron contacts him, it is a charge. If PG *has not* established position before LeBron gets there, it is a blocking foul.

It is important to understand that the way LGP is applied changes depending on the type of play. On a shot or pass attempt, LGP needs to be established before the offensive player begins his upward motion to shoot or pass. **On a dribbling play like this, the upward motion clause is not in play**, which allows Paul George to quickly get to the spot and establish LGP before LeBron charges into him. Here is the case play:

NBA Case Play 29

*Player A1 is dribbling the ball and Player B1 jumps into his path. What is the deciding point between block or charge?*

A dribbler is expected to be in control at all times and if a defender can legally get to a ‘spot’ in the path of the dribbler, **it is the dribbler’s responsibility to stop and/or change direction** immediately. However, if a defender cannot completely get his torso in his path without making contact, a blocking foul should be called.

COMMENTS ON THE RULES - C

###The [fourth foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=220) was called by Tom Washington at 11:39 second quarter (6:24 later).

Foul. LeBron clearly hits Hibbert’s arm. No discussion necessary.

###The [fifth foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=248) was called by Ed Malloy at 8:34 third quarter (3:05 later).

I watched this play probably 30 times. Stephenson is fouled four times on this play, three times by LeBron. The first foul is an illegal screen by Rashard Lewis (moving forward into Lance at point of contact, also lowers shoulder *outside his frame*).

After Lance hits the ball out (clean), he tries to go around LeBron to the right, but LeBron puts out his right arm, which contacts Lance in the neck (foul). Lance responds by putting his arms around LeBron and tries to pull him out of the way (foul). LeBron then puts both arms behind him, still trying to prevent Lance from getting around him (foul). Then, when Lance dives for the ball, LeBron runs into Lance’s hip causing Lance to slip and hit the floor (foul).

This is a tough play. In this case the referee needs to be looking for either 1) the first foul, or 2) who disadvantages who more. Both players fouled each other, that is clear. But the NBA is a physical game, and when both players have an opportunity to get a loose ball *some* of this type of contact is allowed. In this case **LeBron fouls Stephenson just as Stephenson is about to get the ball**.

As you can see above, the rumor that Ed Malloy called all five fouls is bullshit.

But Devin Booker is historically bad at leading his team to victory. This is Booker's 5th year in the league and he's never led his team to 25 wins. He's led his team to the worst record in the west 3 years in a row though. And it's not like the Sun's are a shit organization. The last time the Sun lost as many games as Devin Booker has lost in his best season was 1969, the very first year of the Sun's organization. That means Devin Booker has played on 4 of the 5 worst teams in Suns history. He's having a good year statistically and the Suns are improved but what other Allstar averaged 60 losses for their first 4 seasons? Most Allstars have probably never even lost 60 games in a season before. And the Sun's improvement is even exaggerated a bit this year, because 19 of the last 34 games are against teams with winning records while only 18 of the first 48 games were against teams with winning records. Brandon Ingram who is also a young star and plays on a losing team has already played 28 games against teams with winning records this year. And only 11 games left this season are against winning teams. So I expect the Suns to drop in the standings and New Orleans to rise. The Suns would be lucky to get 35 wins this season. Which would be a huge accomplishment for Devin Booker, 4 wins less than the Suns had the year before they drafted him, but a huge failure for an Allstar.",0.48,controversial,1/31/20 13:48

Now when I say “isn’t great”, I mean more along the lines that he’ll never be a Lebron James, a Kevin Durant, a Curry or Harden. 

I think he’s a phenomenal talent, but his shooting is SOOO atrocious (and left-handed when he’s right hand dominant and finishes with his right), and defenders can basically give him 100+ feet as long as they remain in front of the rim.

I don’t think he’ll ever improve his shot to a respectable level (thinking 35% from 3 at least) to keep defenses honest. 

What are all of your thoughts? 
How about a comparison in realistic potential of him vs Ingram?

This image perfectly describes Ben Simmons weakness... one I think he’ll never truly overcome.

Edit: In response to a few question... and echoing some replies, I think the chances of him improving his shooting is similar to the chances of Tristan Thompson becoming a shooter.

Ugly form, mechanics are off, but above all else, he has no CONFIDENCE to take the shot. I think he’s an athletic freak and has incredible basketball IQ, but I just can’t see any realistic scenario where he becomes a decent and consistent shooter.",0.54,controversial,7/7/18 20:21

144,[OC] Draft picks aren't worth nearly as much as you think they are : the expected return of a no1 overall pick is … Matt Barnes,74,bpbj9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bpbj9f/oc_draft_picks_arent_worth_nearly_as_much_as_you/,155,1558036029,"I think there's a massive gap between the perceived value of a draft pick, and it's actually value as far as contributing wins to the franchise that gets it.

This has a couple of results : 

1. Teams, media and fans all give picks far more value than they're actually worth in trades involving players

2. It puts an unreasonably high expectation on all top draft picks, who are all expected to be studs, when statistically, simply being a good starter means they're probably above average

3. It puts unreasonably high expectations on front offices, who are seen as failures if they didn’t get the best player available with their pick, when statistically, it’s almost impossible to get it right, outside of maybe no1 overall.

So I wanted to compile the average and median values of each 1st and 2nd round pick in the draft since 1985 (beginning of the lottery) to 2016 (2017 and 2018 draftees just haven't been in the league long enough), using the two most recognised publicly available cumulative advanced stats : Win Shares (WS) and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP). Neither of which are perfect, but they give a bit of an idea.

(Note : even stopping the range at the 2010 draft, the median results aren’t really changed in any significant manner).

I'm using both median and average, but the median is probably far more representative. Since these are cumulative stats, the worst outliers don't stay in the league long enough to accumulate massively negative totals, whereas the best outliers can rack up WS/VORP for 20 years. Median is far less susceptible to outliers, so **pay attention to the median column more than the average.**

A few notes :

- There's a monumental gap between the value of the no1 pick and the next most valuable pick (3rd, surprisingly).

- There's an almost inexplicable dip after the 5th pick, by both metrics, which then rebounds with the 9th and 10th picks.

And just for fun, the median outcome for the *best* 2nd round pick, 31st, is Joe Alexander. Who ? Exactly.

All this isn’t even mentioning that, in the current NBA, it’s increasingly difficult to hold onto whoever you draft with a high pick. So there are few good players that are statistically bolstering the median, and even moreso average value of the players drafted at a certain pick, but nowadays, odds are a large chunk of that value isn’t even going to be for the team that picked the guy. Further downgrading the value of a pick.

----------

Now, to be fair, those are the values of what each specific pick ends up being worth. But you could make the argument that the inherent value of a pick is the best player left available at that spot, not the player picked with it.

Personally, I don’t really agree with that, because, again, statistically, it’s almost impossible to actually get the “best player still available” with any pick that isn’t no1. 

For example, from 1984 to 2016, according the WS stat, the player picked 2nd ended up being the best player still available at second a total of … 4 times. Out of 33, AKA 12%. This isn’t because 88% of front offices are incompetent, it’s because the draft is a crapshoot. Even with all the scouting and player projection stats in the world, it’s almost impossible to know ahead of time who the best player left is. Front offices keep convincing themselves that, because they’re good, they’ll actually get value out of a 6th or 8th pick or whatever, but odds are, they won’t.

But here’s the catch, even if every single front office from 1984 to 2016 had a time machine, and could know in advance who the best player available at each pick was, picks *still* wouldn’t be as valuable as you think.

Here’s the value of the “best player left” at each pick :

More notes :

- Obviously, it’s a lot better. But there’s still a big gap between no1 and the rest.

- If you’re wondering why the list ends at 56, it’s because there’s never been any NBA draft from 1984 to 2016 in which 57 or more players actually played in the league.

Here's an example of a couple of retired players whose career VORP and WS are roughly equal to the median value of the best player left at each top-10 pick :

|Pick|Players approaching median value (VORP)|Players approaching median value (WS)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|

Sure, it’s better, but still. The best player you can expect to still be available with a 5th pick in the draft is a Rick Fox level player ? Is a 5th pick *that* valuable, considering Rick Fox is who you could reasonably expect to get, **assuming you get lucky and pick the best player available** ??

-----

#Conclusion

A set pick, after the lottery has taken place, is not that valuable. Teams fall in love with the possibility of getting something great, and grossly overvalue them. The Lakers’ 4th pick, for example. The best player that the Lakers (or whoever trades for that pick) can expect to be available at that slot is a Luol Deng, Antoine Walker level player. And statistically, no team with the 4th pick has ever actually correctly picked the 4th best player on that draft. So the best player that will be available, likely won’t be better than a 2 or 3 time All-Star, and it’s almost certain that you won’t even guess who it is.

But a future pick, that you have zero idea (especially with the flattened lottery odds) where it’s actually going to end up in the draft, in a draft class that you can’t possibly know the strength and depth of a year or two ahead of time ? That should have less value than any reasonably decent NBA player.

Say a team like Chicago was offering up its 2021 first round draft pick. GMs around the league would be salivating at that idea, and ready to pay through the nose for it. But the expected return for that pick is actually lower than a guy like Elfrid Payton or Terry Rozier. But if Chicago traded their 2021 1st for one of those guys, the entire NBA world would go crazy.

Oh, and I haven’t even mentioned that, since the one-and-done rule is one the way out, the draft is going to become *even more* of a crapshoot.

**TL;DR** Just as someone eventually figured out that 3 point shots, or versatile wing defenders, were undervalued, some GM will inevitably figure out that draft picks are overrated. Any team that isn’t a bottom feeder and owns a pick that’s perceived as having value (Celtics having the Grizzlies pick, Lakers’ 4th pick, etc) should look to sell high on that pick immediately. Any team that’s looking to rebuild should look to free agency as their way out, or smart trades for good young players, not tanking. Building a contender through the draft only works if you manage to hoard a shitton of high first rounders, and get very, *very* lucky.",0.55,controversial,5/16/19 12:47

I think winning the championship with Toronto put a wrench in his plans for coming to LA because it would have looked a lot better if they had lost. This whole prolonged period of 'indecision' is just Kawhi looking like he's really considering all his options when really he's just gonna go to the Laker's. It's why he didn't announce it right after meeting with the Raptors and the buzz was at an all time high. He's gonna keep waiting til doubt creeps in for Toronto and then eventually he'll announce Lakers during the weekend.

Majority of their title legacy comes from the early days of the nba WHEN THERE WERE ONLY 8 TEAMS. Not only were their 8 teams but most of the HOF of the era were on the Celtics team. So to tout championships to fans and franchise of 30 modern day teams is irreverent it's basically an award for who was there first. Then we go in too the Larry Bird era which is no doubt impressive 3 titles and 5 appearances in the 80s.  That's great and at the point was establishing themselves as a franchise with a championship pedigree. Then they went on to win 1 title in the past 32 years. How is this impressive? How do they hold a reputation of ""if you want to win titles you should play for the Celtics"" when besides one era that hasn't been the case.

149,I rewatched the second quarter of last nights Celtics-Sixers game and took a look at every foul call against the Celtics,0,8hv9fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8hv9fe/i_rewatched_the_second_quarter_of_last_nights/,39,1525799124,"Since a lot of people were outraged about the fould discrepancy in that quarter and attributed it to the league wanting to extend the series, I looked at every foul call and tried to determine if it was the right call. I don't have a horse in the race since the Sixers beat our ass in the last round and fuck the Celtics anyway.   


1. 10:43 Marcus Morris: Right call. grabs Embiid in the paint to prevent a layup
2. 07:43 Marcus Smart: Right call. swipes Embiid across the face and doesn't complain for a second afterwards
3. 07:31 Jaylen Brown: Soft call. technically the right call because Jaylen is out of position when the contact with Saric occurs. The refs should not have called that on the first contact imo. 
4. 07:01 Jayson Tatum (offensive foul): Right call. Tatum grabs Redick's arm and pulls him to the ground when trying to establish position in the post. 
5. 05:56 Semi Ojeleye: Right call. even though Belinelli flops a bit. Ojeleye pushes Belinelli into Simmons after a screen. 
6. 05:15 Semi Ojeleye: Probably the right call but could have been a play on imo. There is no replay but it looks like Ojeleye is out of position when the contact with Ilyasova occurs and he doesn't complain much after the call which is usually a sign for a right call. 
7. 04:21 Marcus Morris: Right Call. He hits Saric on the arm.
8. 03:50 Marcus Morris: Really hard to tell. Redicks tries to go over an Embiid screen and it seems like Morris pushes him of his path. No replay so impossible to tell how much contact really occurred. 
9. 02:51 Aron Baynes: Right call. Baynes slowly reacts to Embiids movement and does not establish position before the contact.
10. 02:40 Marcus Smart: It's the loose ball foul that's also on the front page. Watching it live in real time it seemed like the right call. Simmons steals the ball, Smart dives to the floor and it looks he hit's Simmons legs causing him to fall. In the replay you can see that Simmons starts to fall before the contact occurs and it should have been a no call. Really difficult call to make imo because in that situation it's a foul on the defender almost every other time.
11. 02:31 Terry Rozier (offensive foul): Right call hits Redick in the face. Afterwards the scuffle with Embiid occurs where a double tech was warranted imo. 
12. 01:40 Jaylen Brown: Really hard to tell. There is some grabbing and pushing going on between Brown and Belinelli away from the ball. To me it looks like a bit of a flop by Belinelli, which you could also consider a veteran move by him. He sold the call and Brown should have not engaged in that contact with 2 Fouls already.   


In conclusion I would say that foul calls against the Celtics were mostly warranted with few questionables among them. What I didn't check for is non-calls that the Celtics should have gotten in their favor. But the 12 fouls that were called against them during that quarter are not evidence that the league tried to rigg the game.",0.49,controversial,5/8/18 10:05

All last year, and during this offseason everyone has been shitting on him because he sucked so bad. Now we trade him, and everyone instantly gets on the ""LET'S SHIT ON THE KINGS RIGHT MEOW"" bandwagon.

Do you guys not understand?

We just dumped our two WORST contracts. Not just bad, but WORST. You think Philly would just take those on for free? Fuck no. We HAD to give up Stauskas just so they get SOMETHING out of this deal.

Yeah, it sucks we had to give him up after one year, and I have no doubt he will continue to improve and be a good player. BUT, now we are in a great position with arond $25million in cap space instead of $10million.

Everyone says"" Yeah, but clearing cap space doesn't mean shit if free agents dont sign there."" And yes, this is true, BUT we have already secured an appointment with Wes Matthews, and we can offer him more money than both Dallas and Toronto who are the other 2 teams interested in him at this point.

So, we are essentially trading Nik Stauskas for Wes Matthews, because odds are, if we offer him the most money, he will come to Sacramento. No matter how shitty a situation, MONEY TALKS. 

Wes is an immediate upgrade on BOTH ends of the floor, and along with Collison, Rudy Gay, Willie Cauley-Stein, and DeMarcus, that's a damn good starting lineup now. We also still have about $10 million left in cap space to sign other players who we need, whether it be Rondo(which i really hope we don't do), or just solid bench players.

So before everyone keeps running Sacramento into the ground, lets see what happens.

If Wes comes to Sacramento, are you REALLY going to talk shit about this deal? Yes, Nik could end up being better than Wes, but it's going to take at LEAST 3 years for that to happen, and Kings are trying to get a .500+ team before the new arena opens. 

WE DONT NEED TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. JUST WIN 42+ GAMES AND MAYBE SNIFF PLAYOFFS AND KINGS FANS ARE HAPPY.

So please, instead of shitting on the Kings in every possible way possible, wait and see what happens. If we end up getting no free agents to come this offseason after trading Nik, THEN talk shit about us. But not yet.",0.48,controversial,7/2/15 5:45
151,[OC] Why Donovan Mitchell is making this ROTY race close and interesting,16,86xnos,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/86xnos/oc_why_donovan_mitchell_is_making_this_roty_race/,181,1521970262,"I know, I know. We're all sick of hearing about it and talking about it. And I'm mostly in agreement. I wouldn't be posting this had I not put admittedly too much time into it - and I genuinely think I found some  really interesting things that haven't been talked about yet. Obviously I'm a Jazz fan, but I tried to eliminate as much bias as I could in this deep dive. 



**Ben's a rookie. But...**


Let's take a look at some timeline stuff here.



9/30/2016 Ben broke his foot.


01/21/2017  [Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKRJmuPQidE) is seen warming up with his team on a road game. He doesn't look 100% but you can see he's made a lot of progress, and is practicing with the team.


07/10/2017 Philly.com writes an article about how much a year in the NBA benefitted [him.](http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/sixers/ben-simmons-sixers-process-year-off-injury-joel-embiid-20170710.html). This was about a month after the 2017 NBA draft. I think this is significant because I've heard a lot of fans say that Ben's first year didn't benefit him that much, but I think that there are a lot of holes in that argument. 


I think there are 3 reasons why a year in the NBA (even if some of that time is spent injured) is more beneficial than a year in the NBA:

* Basketball is now their life. They don't have to worry about school or any other non-basketball related things. 
* They now have access to the best coaches and trainers in the world. Coaches in the NCAA are good, but the NBA has an overall better player development facilitation.
* They get to develop chemistry with their teammates. Whether it's in practice, or socially, I believe that off court chemistry often translates to on court chemistry.


I understand that Ben is still a rookie, I'm not trying to argue against that. But what if to even the playing field, we counted stats for Donny from 11/20/2017? I'm aware that a lot of people won't agree with this. Donny is still having a great overall season. But from 11/20/2017, he's doing even better.  


**So, what if we didn't count Donovan's first month**


DM since 11/20/2017: 
* 22.0/3.9/3.8 with a TS% of 55.7%. 


Only 20 players in the league average at least 21/3/3 since 11/20/2107. DM is 11th on that list in FG%. 


Out of all the players that are under 6'4"", there are only 7 who have similar or better [stat](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=AGE&dir=-1&CF=PTS*G*21:AST*G*3:REB*G*3&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F23%2F2018&Height=LT%206-4) line. This obviously isn't a standalone argument, but I find it interesting. Some good company on that list. 


**Donovan's Rebounding**  


One of the main arguments against Donovan not getting ROY is that Ben averages double his rebounds. Which seems silly to me, since rebounding has in large part due to height, so it make sense that an agile 6'10"" guard would have more rebounds than Dono, at 6'3"". But I wanted to prove that Donny is a damn good rebounder for his height. So I found [this](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&dir=1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=GP*G*50:REB*G*3&Height=LT%206-4). He's 4th in the league in contested rebounds compared to players under 6'4"".


I also found it interesting that Ben is [second to last](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&dir=-1&CF=REB*GE*7&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&Height=GT%206-4) in contested rebounds amongst players who average 7 or more rebounds and are taller than 6'4"". Again, not a convincing standalone stat, and Ben is still a good rebounder, but maybe the gap between Dono and Ben isn't as wide as the season averages suggest.


**Donovan's Assists**


Again, a common argument against Dono is that he only averages half the amount of assists as Ben. Here's what I found on that:


* Ben averages 75.4 passes a game. That's 10 more than the next highest passer. 
* He assists 7.8 times a game so that means has just above 10% pass to assist ratio. Which doesn't sound bad and could in large part have to do with the 76ers offense, but when you compare him to the rest of the players in the NBA, he's 37th on the list of pass to assist ratio% for players that pass the ball more than 30 times a game. 
* However, only 15 players are averging more than 7 assists a game.
* Out of 75.4 passes made, 16.5 are potential assists. And out of those 16.5, 7.8 of those end up being assists. The Don's numbers: 38.5 passes made, 6.9 are potential assists, and 3.6 end up being assists. 


Not a huge argument against Ben, I don't think it matters that he passes the ball alot, and get's passed to a lot(80 times a game). But, the percentage of assists is what I was looking at. Donovan averages 9.8% assists a game, meaning that if he passed the ball as much as Ben, he'd average just as many assists. Interestingly enough, Dario Saric averages almost as many assists as Ben - and the Jazz don't have a single player that averages more than 5. Everyone averages from like 3-5.



**Donovan is the Jazz's #1 scoring option and go to in the clutch**


I think the game last night against the Spurs is the answer as to why he is. He's got a lot of room to improve still which is the crazy thing. This is one of the bigger reasons why I think this ROTY race is close, and Ben isn't as much of a shoe in as people may think. Donovan is leading the team in scoring, and is clearly the guy that the Jazz want to have the ball in his hands in close situations as a rookie. But let's look at some stats and see how he fares against the rest of the league and maybe you'll see why I put so much weight on it. It's not a comparison to Ben's TDs, it's a comparison to the rest of the league this year.

 

* Donny is 4th in the NBA in 4th Q USG% and 9th in 2nd half USG%. 
* He's 8th in scoring in the second half, only 1.4 points behind the MVP James Harden. 
* He averages 7.2 pts in the 4th Q (4th in the league). Not that it matters, but that's almost double what Ben averages(3.7)
* [Context is everything](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&dir=-1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F24%2F2018&Period=4&CF=GP*G*35) I think it's significant to point out that he's ahead of James Harden, Lebron, Giannis, Lillard, Irving and on and on. His rebound and assists go up in the 4th - in fact just about everything improves in the 4th for Donny.  


**How do the Jazz do when Donovan excells?**


* When Spida scores more than 1/4 of his season average for scoring in the 4Q (so more than 5PTS), the Jazz are 25-15 (which includes a tough as shit december where we were without our star center). 
* The Jazz are 28-15 when he averages more than half his season average in the 2nd half (again includes a hard december). 
* Since December 30th, they're 22-4 when he averages more than half his season average in the 2nd half. 


One thing I found interesting is when Don overperforms with his rebounds and assists.

* When DMitch has 2 or more assists in the 2nd half, the jazz are 26-13.
* When he has 2 or more rebounds in the 2nd half, they're 29-14.

Again, not a standalone argument. But still something of note. It's also interesting at doing the same thing with Ben's rebounds and assists.


* When Ben has 4 or more assists in the 2nd half, the 76ers are 16-14. 
* When he has 2 or more assists in the 4th Q, they're 14-17. 
* When he has 2 or more rebounds in the 4th Q, they're 21-16. 
* They're 22-14 when he has more than 4 rebounds in the 2nd half. 

It's really interesting to see how they don't do as well when Ben assists a lot in the 4th Q. Not really sure why, or if it's even significant. 


**Other Stats about the Don's scoring**

* Donovan is [12th](https://stats.nba.com/players/scoring/?sort=PCT_UAST_2PM&dir=-1&CF=MIN*G*30:GP*G*30&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) in the league in unassisted 2 point FG% at 76.7 - meaning he creates shots for himself. 
* He's [9th](https://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVE_PTS&dir=1&CF=DRIVES*G*8&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F24%2F2018) in the league in points off of drives at 7.9 at 47.8%. James Harden is at 53%  It's actually where DM gets a third of his assists too; off of the drive. 


**Making history**


Let me first point out that Ben's TD record is really impressive. Definitely one of the main arguments for him getting ROY. But since when have triple doubles been the pinnacle of succes where all other stats pale in comparison to the almighty triple double? I think it definitely holds a lot of significance, but I don't know if it's as much of a trump card as people say it is. If it matters, the 6ers are 6-4 when Ben get's a TD.


So where does Donovan stand?

* 2 40+ point games. Most since Blake Griffin and if I knew how to compare that to rookies over the past 20+ years I would - but I'm guessing it's pretty impressive. One of those games includes the 6th most effecient 40 point game (based on fg%) this season if you filter out games where people took less than 6 3PA and is 9th if you include those. He had 5 rebounds and 6 assists in that game too might I add, and had a TS% of 95.5%, and offensive rating of 141.1, a defensive rating of 82.2, and a net rating of 58.8 in 33 minutes. The Jazz are 2-0 when Dono scores more than 40. 
* 25 25+ point games. I don't know how that compares to other other rookies in like the past 20-30 years but I would assume it's significant. That Jazz's record during those games? 16-9; 13-3 since december 30th (Ugh, that december...). Donny averages 51.46/36/85.3, and an EFG% of 58.1 in these games.
* 39 20+ point games. I really wish I could find the stats on how that compares to rookies over the past 20-30 years. The Jazz are 25-14 when he scores 20 or more points. 
* He's currrently on pace to averge more than 20 pts a game. Only 44 rookies have ever done that all time, and 21 since 1980. 
* He's also on pace to tie Damien Lillards record of most 3 pointers made by a rookie, and be 2nd (behind Joe Ingles) in most 3 pointers made in a season in franchise history.



**What a time to be a basketball fan**


Alright, I think that's all I got. My ultimate goal of this whole thing is to convince people that the race for ROY is and should be close. I'll also point out how awesome that is. How lucky are the Jazz and the 76ers. 


One last thought. Ben is incredible and will be well deserving of the award if he wins (and the future MVPs he'll win). Despite what a lot of people say I don't think that the fact that Ben doesn't shoot threes(yet) or has a below average FT% should count against him. Just like because of some of the stats I've listed above I don't think that the fact that Donovan doesn't have as many assists or rebounds as Ben does has as much weight as people say it does. 


A lot of these stats are pulled from 11/20/17, but most of them are pretty similar to if you changed it to the entire year. The biggest difference is that Donovan averages(currently) 20 points on the year, and 22 from 11/20/2017.


p.s. I welcome all criticism if you think some of my stats are off/ don't mean anything and would love to hear your opinion about any of them. 




TL;DR Basically, this ROTY is and should be close. Look at some of my points above if you don't believe me.

By taking care of himself, Kyrie had a fantastic season with the Celtics and is poised to make a run at the finals this season on that team rather than being on whatever remains of the Cavs with Lebron off to another team built for being a finals contender.

156,[OC] Why the Celtics' 21-4 start won't be sustainable.,0,7ht9d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7ht9d0/oc_why_the_celtics_214_start_wont_be_sustainable/,64,1512540651,"Before I start, I want to say that this post isn't calling the Celtics a bad team or disparaging their red-hot start to the season. It's just saying that their crazy success so far may be unsustainable.

When the Celtics' season started off with Gordon Hayward's gruesome leg injury and an 0-2 start, no one on r/nba or in the real world expected the Celtics would perform nearly as well as they have so far. However, the young, woke Celtics have been 21-2 since then including victories over the Raptors, Thunder, Spurs and Warriors. Their hot start has been fueled by great 3-point shooting (8th 3P% in the NBA), excellent team defense (1st in DefRtg). However, these stats- and this hot streak- are very unsustainable.

**Three-Point Shooting**

The Celtics are 8th in the NBA in three-point percentage, and if you factor out Marcus Smart's abysmal 29.6% on 4.3 attempts per game, they jump all the way up to 2nd. This three-point shooting boost has been heavily influenced by the improvement of Al Horford and Jaylen Brown from beyond the arc, and the surprising shooting ability of Jayson Tatum. 

Al Horford finished last year shooting 35.5% from beyond the arc, which is about his career average. However, this year he's started out at a scorching 44.6%-a 9.1% jump. 9.1% is the difference between Lonzo Ball's three-point percentage and Khris Middleton's. It doesn't take a genius or a Bayesian statistician to predict that the odds of that lasting are low. However, even if he sustains his percentages miraculously, odds are that Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum won't.

Jaylen Brown has nearly tripled his three-point attempts this season, which usually correlates with a decrease in percentage. Instead, his percentage has actually increased from 34.1% to 40.2%. This 6% increase is the difference between LeBron's three-point percentage in 2004 and his three-point percentage this year. Both Brown and Horford will likely come back to earth, and that's without mentioning Jayson Tatum.

Jayson Tatum is shooting 51.3% from 3 this season, a ridiculously high percentage considering he was a 34.2% shooter in college. If Lonzo Ball makes his next 90 three-point attempts, his three-point percentage still won't have made the same jump Tatum's has. Tatum has been putting up excellent shooting numbers this season, as have Horford and Brown, but the truth is that all these percentages are unsustainable.

**Defense and ""Intangibles""**

The Celtics have also been the number one defensive team in the NBA during their hot start, arguably even more important to their success than their three-point shooting. However, teams have been shooting pretty poorly against them. Teams shoot a paltry 34 percent from three against the Celtics, the 26th-highest percentage against any team in the NBA, and only 48.4 percent from inside the arc, also good for 26th. However, it's been shown many times that opponent field goal percentage isn't really affected by defense, so these numbers may also be fluky. The Celtics are certainly a very good defensive team, due in no small part to coach Brad Stevens, but they probably aren't the best team in the league by a good margin like their DefRtg would show.

The Celtics have demonstrated the ability to win close games this season and close out in the last few minutes. This trait, while certainly a sign of a good team, is also very luck-based and will revert closer to the mean over the course of the season. The only way their close game win percentage can be sustainable is if Kyrie Irving does what Isaiah ""Mr. 4th Quarter"" Thomas did last year and continues to put up insane fourth quarter numbers. However, if that doesn't happen, the Celtics will probably revert closer to their Pythagorean win total, which would put them currently at 18-7.

Even more factors, like the Celtics' bottom-five strength of schedule, have helped them during their miraculous winning streak. And looking at the statistics, it's just not going to be possible for the Celtics to maintain their 65-win pace. Sooner or later they will revert back to the mean.

**Conclusion: The Celtics are still good**

However, the mean for the Celtics is still very good. Brad Stevens, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, and a plethora of talented role players won the 1-seed last year with an arguably worse roster. Sure, they probably aren't in the Cavs/Warriors/Rockets tier yet, but if their young stars develop they can get there soon especially with their top-tier coaching. The Boston Celtics are a problem for the rest of the NBA and, with their young stars, future assets, and GM-wizard Danny Ainge, will be for a long time.",0.5,controversial,12/5/17 22:10

161,Brandon Ingram is One of The Most Overrated Players in The League,534,a8xjgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a8xjgt/brandon_ingram_is_one_of_the_most_overrated/,466,1545622292,"When Brandon was drafted, a lot of people, myself included, thought he’d be a walking bucket. As a Duke fan, I loved to cheer for him in college and I thought he’d be great in the league.
  
  
Obviously, he dissapointed massively in his rookie season. That might have been the worst season i’ve ever seen a player play. He struggled to score in any fashion whatsoever. I’ll admit Ingram’s come far from his rookie season as one of the worst players in the league to become a good player. But now I think he’s becoming massively overrated. 
  
  
The stigma around Ingram I’ve seen in past and current trade talks label him a marquee talent I personally think he’s undeserving of, and I find that casual fans or fans from other teams are very unaware about the type of player he is. They might tout his 39% 3PP from last year to describe him as a great shooter, but anybody who watches him here obviously know that that percentage came as a result of a very selective shot selection. He doesn’t like to shoot any off the dribble 3s or rhythm threes. He only considers taking them when he’s at least two feet wide open. They commonly for some reason I don’t know think of him as some low post or mid range savant, but he’s far from that. I mean sure he **takes** a lot of pull ups and post up shots, but he makes about barely enough of them to warrant him a pass to keep attempting them. For his pull ups, i’ve compared him to somebody who takes around as many pull up shots as him: Jamal Murray. Last season from 10-16 ft, Ingram shoots 35% compared to Murray’s 48%. For post ups, I compared his second season to Kobe in his rookie season since they were in somewhat similar positions and took the same frequency of shots from 3-10 ft. Ingram shot 20.7% compared to Kobe’s 40.9%. That’s half of Kobe’s percentage. He is by every means a below average shooter from these areas. Every label he’s given as a shooter is wildly innacurate, and frankly I don’t think his 3 point shot will ever be his bread and butter as a result of his hesitancy like it sort of was at Duke. The dude also is given credit as a great playmaker, but I’d say he’s just average. He misses one or two too many reads a game.
  
  
So, what are his strengths? Does he have any? I’ll give him props on D. He can be a pest on the perimeter with his length. Maybe driving? He converted on 65.7% of his shots from close range last season. He is also consistent i’d say. You can always expect around 15 points, 3 assists and 3 rebounds from him. 
  
  
As you can see, Ingram’s not amazing at anything. In fact, I’d say even his consistency could be spun against his case as a future all star because he is consistently average. He doesnt like to go all out for one game and excluding his career high against the Warriors, in his 2 and a half years in the league so far, as far as I am concerned he has had no breakout game. So what’s my problem with Ingram, he’s not amazing at any particular thing. Like for Lonzo, I can say he’s a great passer and defender. I can say Kuzma’s a great shooter, because he’s shown multiple glimpses of his potential. He’s made 6 threes in a half before and scored over 30 a couple times, but I can’t say anything similar about Ingram.

Conclusively, Ingram is average at almost everything. He is, however, very well rounded. And for that reason i’d say he his ceiling is a fringe all star. Maybe a top 40-50 player. Very good, but not the best. I’d love to say otherwise, but he hasn’t shown me much yet.

165,Dwight Howard is NOT the best Center in the NBA,6,1jpuoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jpuoc/dwight_howard_is_not_the_best_center_in_the_nba/,140,1375700954,"Dwight is going to be the defensive anchor the Houston Rockets next year. He rebounds, blocks, alters shots, and gets points on the board – so why am I writing this? Because there is one other center in the league that does all this and more. Marc Gasol is that player. He recently won the Defensive Player of the Year award, something Dwight has already achieved three consecutive times in his career. But that was then, and this is now.

Offense

Firstly, let’s look at offense. Dwight Howard averaged a very respectable 17.1ppg for the Lakers last season. He was recovering from back surgery at the time, so I will give him the benefit of the doubt he will get recover 100%, and am going to use the season prior to last year as a bench mark to make the comparison fairer. In that case, he averaged 20.6 and 1.9 assists in 38.3 minutes of play. Comparatively, Gasol averaged 14.1ppg and a ridiculous 4 assists a game in 35.0 minutes of play. 20.6 is a larger number than 14.1, but let’s look at the details shall we?

Dwight Howard game consists almost totally on shots at the basket – 95.45% of his shots came in the paint.

graphic

He did an amazing job shooting 66.22% under the basket and 44.31% in the paint, but his efficiently drops elsewhere. The 42.31%, although somewhat good, does not tell the whole story because he only attempted 26 shots in 54 games from there. That’s not a shot the coaching staff of the Magic, Lakers, or Rockets want him taking.

Marc Gasol’s versatility is inconceivably better than Dwight’s. He not only shoots nearly as well as Howard from inside (66.22% vs 63.85%), but his midrange game is at an extraordinary 47.69%. The 50% mark is the standard for an efficient scorer; he’s doing this at 7’1 from 15-18 feet out. Not many centers, if any at all, can achieve this result.

graphic

In this day and age, floor spacing is everything. The Heat and Spurs, the two teams in the Finals last year, bombarded their opponents with 3’s while having one big man to anchor the middle. Gasol spreads the floor so well, the Grizzles have the luxury of playing two big men at once. Dwight on the other hand is confined to just the paint.

Passing also plays a key part in floor spacing. It is the fastest way to move the ball and thus forces the defense to scramble to move with it. That is why Gasol’s 4.0 assists a game are so important. His 4.0 assists a game are better than some starting point guard’s, which is a testament to his passing ability from both the low post and high post. Dwight averaged just 1.9 assists in his last season in for the Magic, which is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing too spectacular either.

Offensive rebounding is clearly Howard’s forte. Although he didn’t qualify to be ranked because he did not manage to play 56 games, he would’ve made 5th on the list. The year before that, he came in 3rd. Marc Gasol comes in 30th, right next to Blake Griffin. However, don’t doubt Marc’s ability to grab offensive boards. Zach Randolph, his frontcourt mate, took 1st on the list and if anybody watches the Grizzles, they’ll notice the Grizzles play a high-low offense. This means Randolph is placed under the basket, while Gasol is at the foul-line extended.

The video below, at 0:16 and 0:30 and so on, shows multiple variations of plays the Grizzles use when using Randolph and Gasol. As you can see, Gasol usually plays higher up, thus preventing him any chances to grab offensive boards unless they pop out far enough. This is the play style of the Grizzles. It’s not as if Gasol cannot grab rebounds, it’s the offensive sets designed for the team which places him in inopportune places to grab them.

As time winds down on the clock, teams tend to engage the Hack-a-Howard defense. Howard shot a horrid 49.1% from the charity strip while Gasol shot 84.8%. Howard cannot be trusted going to the line but the coach cannot take him out of the game. It would be “disrespectful” toward a superstar, and the media would build a ridiculous amount of drama around it. In other words, the coach would be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Gasol on the other hand, wouldn’t need to be taken off the court when these situations come into play. His was actually best free throw shooter of all forwards and centers in the league, exluding Kevin Durant. Although free throws are generally placed at a lower level of importance, we’ve all seen how important when teams are so good, the only thing separating them is a few easy buckets.

The last few things I want to go over is minutes, usage, and TO’s. Howard clearly gets more minutes than Gasol does. More minutes means more opportunities. The same goes for usage and TO’s. It’s understandable that Howard has more turnovers (3.2) compared to Gasol’s (2.0), but clearly, Gasol’s role has him passing more. Furthermore, Howard’s extra minutes, usage, and thus more points, help soften the disparity Howard’s and Gasol’s points per game.

Defense

Many people look at blocks and steals as the only measurement of defense. Even Dwight Howard said Serge Ibaka should’ve won the last two DPoY awards because “he led the league in blocks. That’s what defense is all about.” I highly doubt defense is hinged solely on blocks from bigs. If that were true, Sanders is the second best defensive big man this season, JaVale the season before, and Bogut should’ve won the DPoY 3 years ago instead of Howard. Clearly it’s very difficult to judge defense because all five players need to communicate and work as one unit – a different beast when compared to offense.

The pick-and-roll is used so often nowadays with the influx of amazing guards, big men need to learn to “hedge.” Howard is very quick on his feet and hedges so well that his guard can recover without letting the opposing guard drive right by, or let the big dive into the middle. Gasol does this as well, although his foot speed isn’t as quick as Howard’s.

Help defense is a key role in determining a good defensive player. Howard arguably does this better than any other big man. On the Lakers, Pau Gasol didn’t have the foot speed to keep up with the “stretch 4’s.” Howard was usually quick to rotate and help block/alter shots. Likewise, Marc Gasol does this too, but he isn’t nearly as athletic or quick as Howard. His blocks are slightly lower, 1.7 to Dwight’s 2.1, but that doesn’t mean Gasol didn’t help his team. The Grizzles had a 95.4 defensive rating with him on the court, good for second in the league, but a mediocre 102.2 with him off the court. Howard too helped the Lakers tremendously when he was on the court earning a 101.7 DR and 107.8 (near the bottom of the league) off the court. It’s hard to justify one better than the other because, although the Grizzles had a much better defensive rating with Gasol on the court compared to the Lakers and Howard, the Grizzles are just a better team defensively overall. A part of help defense is closing out on three point shooters. Howard takes this because of pure quickness and athleticism.

Defensive rebounding is the final key ingredient to a good defense, at least, when you don’t have a player like LeBron James. Howard wins this category because of his ridiculous 10.8 defensive boards compared to Gasol’s measly 5.8. I do believe Howard is a better rebounder, but I would like to point out Howard was running with 4 shooters while the Grizzle had two big men in the paint splitting rebounds. Nevertheless, I cannot discount Howard’s league-leading monster rebounding prowess.

So what do you guys think – Is Howard, Gasol, or somebody else the best center in the NBA? Comment or take the poll to see what others have to say!

The graphic is ""shot performance"" which displays shooting percentages and shot distribution. The video is a link to a youtube clip showing the grizzles offense. If you guys want to see them, they're over at my blog at [onemanbreak](http://onemanbreak.wordpress.com)

I reply to all comments, good or bad. Thanks for taking your time to read this and have a good day :)

Edit: Added an extra parapgraph concerning free throws.


tl;dr Just because Dwight's ppg and boards are higher than Gasol's doesn't automatically make him a better center. Offensively, Gasol shoots just as well inside as Dwight, and CONSIDERABLY better than the league in the midrange. He's also a damn good passer - just like his brother Pau. Defensively, I gotta say Dwight wins because of sheer athleticism and quickness. Both are great centers, I just think Gasol's better.",0.52,controversial,8/5/13 4:09
166,[Serious] Team USA catering to superstars such as Lebron James and allowing them to skip events has led to our roster being depleted,5,d37p0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/d37p0y/serious_team_usa_catering_to_superstars_such_as/,104,1568322681,"After hearing CJ Mccolluns interview on the Woj podcast, I believe this all begins with Lebron 

You've probably noticed a trend by now... since 2012, Lebron and multiple stars skip the Team USA camp every year. They started skipping the Olympics as well. 

After completely embarassing losses in 2004 and 2006 where Lebron had reported attitude problems with coaches and staff 

Team USA begged Kobe and Jason Kidd to come in to show young Bron, Melo, etc how to truly work hard and lead. They also demanded 3 year commitments from anyone 

However, they now dont ask for commitments anymore since Kobe and J Kidd retired. It's all year to year and it has ruined Team USA.


Superstars drop out weeks before training camp because they know management has no backbone and will let them on the Olympics squad next year 

This leads to a trickling down effect to even the B tier stars, since they're saying ""they're only calling me because they need warm bodies. Stars Bron, Kawhi can skip this year and still be on the Olympics squad next year. All I'm doing is risking injury for no gain"". And that's kinda what CJ said",0.51,controversial,9/12/19 14:11

**Clippers** are an org that try to do everything right (good system, solid role players all around & a team spirit) but lack that ace up their sleeve to do anything meaningful. Headed by the NBA logo himself, they never won a chip but they're looking to change that now.

**Raptors** are outsiders who fight for their own cause, their exuded fighting spirit attracts warriors who are (mostly) not from their own lands. They also don't live near the beach.

And finally the **Lakers** are one of the most celebrated franchises in NBA history. Their method of operation is waving fat stacks of cash alongside the Laker logo until they brainwash the most powerful players into joining them.

Sure, he's a capable defender, and can play some great lockdown on-the-ball defense. When he's on an island with a guy 1-on-1 he's as good as anybody - and I think these instances are what people think of when they think about his defense - but those situations only come up a couple times a game, and the reality is that he takes 99% of possessions off. 

When it comes to ball-watching, team defense, missing assignments, gambling incessantly etc... I really can't think of anyone worse. I mean the guy is completely clueless on team defense it's pretty incredible that people think he's a positive on defense, Hell, some people think that he's elite.

My notion that Westbrook is a negative on defense is not just supported by the eye test, it's backed by data as well. This season, players being guarded by Russell Westbrook have shot a better % than their yearly averages from every shot distance - 3P, 2P, <6 ft, <10 ft, >15 ft - by an average of 3.6%. Players shoot a whopping 48% when guarded by Russ. And of course this doesn't quantify the impact of Russell's team defense which, in my opinion, is the worst part of his game.

Lance is the guy who motivates a lot of these players, because honestly most of the time Roy, George, and Hill just look out of it.

Not all of these are initially Delly's fault- but it does seem like he likes to fall near opponent's legs, throw his own legs in the way of their legs, or in some cases... deliberately knock a player down in retaliation.

Full disclosure, I am a homer and I hate watching this guy play. But I'm here to show why this opinion may be justified, and to shed light on a few incidents that were glossed over during the infamous exodus of Warriors fans between Games 1-4.
_________________________

In reverse chronological-ish order:

^((Shoutout to /u/abrightersummerday and /u/kdub2000 for providing the material and timestamps for the examples)^)

**1. Curry [""falls"" mysteriously.](https://vine.co/v/eOxLbq3OtY3)**  
Even in full speed, I find it odd that Dellavedova is fully prepared for his trailing leg to tangle with Steph's. Anyone who has tangled legs while running before knows that you usually fall out of surprise and a loss of balance. A counterpoint is that Dellavedova just shows supernatural balance and is one of the truly gifted athletes of this generation.

**2. Mo Speights get the steal, [Dellavedova increases his surface area to slow his fall, like a sky diver.](https://twitter.com/BuddyGrizzard/status/607734055229136896)**  
~~I'm half inclined to think that Dellavedova is so confident in his soccer technique and the ineptitude of the referees, that he believes he can save the ball from going out of bounds with his foot. But in reality, Delly was trying to box Mo out from getting the ball, and failed. I think this type of play is reckless- if you can't box out with your body, don't try to throw your leg out there for shits and giggles.~~  
~~Of course, it's possible that Delly is actually just a sub-par athlete, but that conflicts with our previous conclusion that he's an amazing athlete with supernatural balance.~~

/u/BillionaireBob pointed out that Mo actually kicks Delly's leg out here. I was wrong about this one, this is incidental.

**3. Draymond Green sets a hard screen, [Dellavedova retaliates](http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/9/8755229/watch-matthew-dellavedova-dive-into-draymond-greens-knees)**  
As a homer, all I see is Dellavedova scheming to end Draymond's career by popping his kneecap open using the hidden mallet he put in his Australian-brand socks. But in reality, Draymond started it. My issue is that most men with testicles and pride would stand up and start shit, but Dellavedova is fine taking shots at Draymond's hips/knees (depending on who you're rooting for in the finals). Regardless, this incident was mere inches away from Draymond being carted home in a stretcher. I don't like players who let it get below the belt. I'm looking at you, Chris Paul.
___________________________________
**Now, the retrospective section:**

*I didn't believe these plays were dirty at all at first, in fact I defended Delly to the Warriors fans who worried for Curry's health in this matchup.*

*In retrospect, I feel differently. Is it okay to look back and re-evaluate an issue? I believe so. Context matters, and when a player has been in multiple incidents where he's not afraid to tangle up below the belt, it calls into question all of his past actions.*
___________________________________
**4. Al Horford gives Delly the People's Elbow- [but look closely-er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmznHPMBwss&feature=youtu.be&t=35)**  
Did Horford start and end this sequence? Yes. Is he to blame? Yes. But, in my opinion, at the timestamp marked, Delly was kicking his way towards Horford in an attempt to land on his legs. I may or may not have felt this way before I saw the three examples preceding this, but it wouldn't be the first time. And that of course, leads me to the final example...

**5. The Kyle Korver [Incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyXod83nR1Y#&t=27sec)**  
I know we've been over this one before, and it doesn't warrant any further discussion. *There is NOTHING about this play that would make me think it's intentional*. But I've seen the other footage, and my conclusion after these five separate events is that Dellavedova just doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't care if he breaks your legs. He doesn't care if you trip or fall. *He doesn't care about sacrificing his own body, or yours, to make a play.*

_________________________________

That last statement to me, is the real problem. When a player doesn't respect their own well-being more than they respect winning a game, it's normally a good thing. But what about when that player is small, a poor athlete, and grew up playing some sort of Australian bloodsport?

To me, Dellavedova crosses lines. He may not intend to injure players, but he doesn't seem to be particularly risk-averse. He will fall on the ground and break his knee to save a lose ball, but he'll just as quickly break your knee to do the same.

My point is that Delly's dirty play is a different breed than what we call other dirty players. Patrick Beverly may grab and hold and irritate, Draymond Green and Zbo may throw an elbow, Serge Ibaka may punch you in the nuts, the list goes on. But an elbow probably isn't going to put you in a stretcher. A punch in the balls is temporary. And besides, **how many of those players have 5 GIF-worthy incidents in a span of 10 games?** What happens when a player's entire game is predicated on crossing a line below the belt?

I obviously have vested interests here. But to me, Delly isn't playing basketball out there. And the league should do something about it- in the form of a memo, or a phone call to this kid who's overcompensating for a lack of talent in a way that puts players in danger.

Klay Thompson exists in a strange place in the NBA. Though he’s an All-Star and All NBA talent on the best team in the league, he is commonly regarded as the least essential part of the Golden State Warriors core lineup. His supporting role in the offense has led to him being involved in many trade rumors.  He’s been in talks for Kevin, Paul George and most recently, kyrie Irving
Those trades have all been rejected by Bob Myers and the Warriors because they know how valuable Thompson is to their team’s chemistry and makeup. Klay Thompson has been molded into the perfect complement for Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.

> Comparisons: Best Case: I've seen a lot of people saying Mike Bibby, so I'll go with that; Worst Case: Jannero Pargo, Steve Kerr, and JJ Redick. Bottom Line: Curry is an incredibly smart player. Not only does he understand the game, he understands his limitations. He probably is never going to end up being a star in the league because of a lack of explosiveness (meaning he will be a huge defensive liability). He should be able to hang around the league because of the all-around offensive package he brings to the table. - Bleacher Report, May, 2009 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/183841-nba-draft-prospects-stephen-curry-davidson


 **Klay Thompson** 

> But, at a career 42.3 % NCAA field goal percentage, this is precisely what worries me about Thompson: He perhaps overachieves on guile and his statistical production could reflect guile’s limitations. The concern is that the Warriors drafted already-realized potential, as opposed to tapping a grower like Kawhi Leonard........It’s this kind of action that draws praise from film-gurus like Sebastian Pruiti. I’m equally impressed by his screen-usage, but more than happy to go negative with a positive: If Thompson is this smart, then why aren’t his numbers smarter? This kid certainly knows how to expertly use picks. I’m just not sure that means Golden State is equally good at it.
What does this mean for Monta? It could mean nothing. Number 11 picks don’t usually become starters (Acie Law was picked at 11, for example).
I’m less inclined to be reverent towards Jerry West than many out there. He’s had a great career, but the septuagenarian executive left Memphis in shambles. Sorry to be age-ist, but I like West better as a consultant than an ultimate decision-maker. - Warriors World, June, 2011 http://www.warriorsworld.net/2011/06/24/klay-smart-gsws-good/

**More...**


> In the bigger picture, I have no idea how this arrest will affect Thompson's future. Have we seen him play his last game as a Coug? Even before his arrest, I figured that was the case. Thompson's a junior who was expected to leave early for the NBA, but there's some doubt about that because he's projected as a late-first round or second-round draft pick. Thompson has said if he were projected to go in the second round, he would stay for his senior season.
If I were an NBA GM, it wouldn't bother me, but maybe the marijuana charge will hurt his draft status. What would bother me more is the fact that Thompson isn't quite ready for the NBA, physically and I would argue emotionally as well. For as good as he is, Thompson can be surprisingly erratic, both with his shot and the ball. Remember, too, that this is also a kid who was late for the team bus in Tempe two weeks ago because he couldn't find his iPod.
But maybe I'm viewing this subjectively as the WSU alum who hopes that Thompson returns. With Thompson, Moore and DeAngelo Casto playing a third year together, the Cougs would be a top-25 team, one with the potential to crack the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.
Whatever happens, Thompson has been consistent in one respect -- good and bad, he never ceases to make you shake your head in disbelief. - SeattlePI, March, 2011 -  http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/moore/article/Thompson-s-erratic-ways-continue-this-time-with-1042357.php 


**Last for Klay**

> He reminds me of a less-quick version of Kevin Martin. Thompson is the son of former L.A. Lakers big man Mychal Thompson. ...Can Klay Thompson play in the NBA? Absolutely. But I've read where he is being compared to Reggie Miller and that is just silly. There is a difference between good, very good, and great. Klay Thompson's 3-pt percentage, this season was 39% (good) but not the 44% (great) that Miller's was at UCLA. Miller shot 54% FG (GREAT!) as a Bruin. Thompson's, as we mentioned, is 42% (not very good). Miller, as a junior, averaged 25.9 ppg. (very good). Thompson was 21.6 as a junior (good). ...I think Klay Thompson can be a good starter in the NBA sometime - but I don't foresee stardom. - Hoops Obsession, June , 2011 http://basslinespin.blogspot.com/2011/06/i-dont-hate-klay-thompson-plus-tyler.html

**Around this time we also had the Monta Ellis trade**

> Both acquisitions are good fits with the Warriors' roster, but neither was able to help Tuesday. The team was in shock before Ellis addressed them in a closed-door meeting and said his goodbyes before the game.
Ellis has been the face of the Warriors' franchise for much of his seven seasons. He was named the league's Most Improved Player in 2007 and has been among the NBA's top scorers the past three seasons.
But he was never a good fit alongside similar-sized Curry, and he started to show his frustration with the organization in the past week. His teammates immediately shared that frustration Tuesday, when Ellis and Udoh were informed of the trade via a scroll at the bottom of the TV.
As many players shook their heads in disbelief, Curry walked over and hugged a solo Udoh. Wright said, ""I'll talk about the game, but I'm not talking about the trade crap."" One Warriors player said, ""If we're giving up, I can feel my hip hurting already.""
""It's time,"" said a smiling Ellis. ""They're moving in a new direction. I can't be mad about that. I was in those shoes at one time, when a veteran guy was playing in front of me. It becomes time for that player to go. It's my time to go.""
The move opens immediate playing time for rookie Klay Thompson, a shooting guard who is getting rave reviews around the league and is considered nearly untouchable by the Warriors.
**With a potential playoff run all but lost, the move also opens the door for the Warriors to be more cautious with Curry's recurring ankle/foot injuries.** They maintain that they're going to try to win as many games as possible, but they'll be shorthanded and could see a precipitous drop in the standings. - SFGATE - March, 2012 http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Warriors-send-Monta-Ellis-to-Milwaukee-Bucks-3406832.php


**more...**


> The Milwaukee Bucks need to head on over to their local casino and put some serious bets down on the roulette table, because they are the luckiest bunch of guys in the country right now.
With the first big trade of the 2011-12 NBA season, the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed to send Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson to the Golden Warriors for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh and Kwame Brown.
After reading that, if you're left thinking ""why in the world would the Warriors make a trade like that?"", you're not alone.
There's no doubt that Andrew Bogut is a solid big man when he's healthy, but Golden State didn't necessarily make an upgrade at any position with this trade. Instead of becoming a better team, they sent away solid and consistent production for an injury-prone player, and a player that's well past his prime in Stephen Jackson.


> To understand the insanity that exists within this trade, just take a minute and look at the comparison between all the players' combined production for each team in this trade.
Bogut and Jackson: 21.8 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 5.6 APG, 24.8 PER, 40.2 FG%
Ellis, Udoh and Brown: 33.7 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 7.2 APG, 41.8 PER, 46.7 FG%
Aside from rebounds per game, the Warriors are the clear winners when it comes to every major statistical category. If you take out both players that are currently injured, Andrew Bogut and Kwame Brown, those statistics become that much more lopsided in the Bucks' favor. Not only are the Warriors sending away a significant amount of offensive production, they are also getting rid of three players that are much more efficient than the talent they are getting in return, which will certainly hold Golden State back this year and into the future. - Bleacher Report, 2012 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1103923-nba-trade-deadline-why-the-warriors-trading-away-monta-ellis-makes-no-sense


**The Warriors records before the 2012 Season:**

**- Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson drafted within this time**

**2009: 26-56**

**2010: 36-46**

**2011: 23-43**

**and then Draymond Green comes**

> Draymond Green is in a staring contest with history right now, and usually, history doesn’t blink first.
For the Golden State Warriors second-rounder, failure is practically assured.
But why? How can we be so certain of Green’s fate at such an early juncture in his career?
The answer is simple.
Green comes from the most historically cursed category of NBA players: He’s a Consensus First Team All-American who wasn’t drafted in the first round.
Moreover, scouts are virtually unanimous in saying that he knows how to play and has a terrific basketball IQ.
What he doesn’t have is a position.
There are concerns that Green, generously listed at 6’8” and 236 pounds, won’t be able to defend either forward spot in the NBA—not to mention that he’s had problems with his conditioning in the past.
So, the odds are stacked against Draymond Green.
If he puts together a solid career, he’ll buck the trend that no player like him has ever been able to.
For what it’s worth, I’m hopeful Green can break the mold into which he’s been cast. Maybe all 30 NBA GMs were wrong to let him slip out of the first round. It’s possible.
But history is standing firmly in front of Green, dispassionately staring him down. - Bleacher Report, 2012  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1248077-golden-state-warriors-why-history-dooms-draymond-green




**Then Golden State fires Mark Jackson after two straight playoff years**

> He continued to put his players in the best possible positions to succeed and grow, particularly his young core. Stephen Curry went from a good, young scorer to an NBA All-Star Game starter under Jackson. Klay Thompson went from a timid rookie to a fearless two-way force. Draymond Green went from being a second-round pick to being one of the most valuable bench players in the NBA.
Jackson's club was the league's third-best road team. His starting lineup had the best plus-minus in the NBA.
Since that article, Jackson's merit has only increased. He almost knocked the Los Angeles Clippers out of the playoffs despite not having Andrew Bogut—his best defensive player and rebounder—on the court. He kept his team together amid nearly unprecedented levels of conflict, deceit and paranoia within the organization. He was endorsed heavily by all of his players.
There are only 10 coaches in the league—at most—that did as good a job as Jackson did of maximizing their talent and getting their teams to buy in, compete and execute.
Jackson deserved to be the Warriors coach next season, and it is not even close. The problem is that ""deserve"" has nothing to do with it. Joe Lacob, Golden State's majority owner, did not want him to be the coach, and so he fired him.


> That's when the locker room starts to weaken. Curry starts to realize that the reason he wanted to be on the Warriors for his entire career was not something inherent about the team or location but rather the special atmosphere that Jackson had created.
Free agents that would have once flocked to Oakland at a discount (such as Iguodala did) start to shy away from signing in a place where the ownership has a history of breaking up successful, potential-laden teams due to ulterior motives.
As quickly as Lacob shed the darkness and dysfunction that had been plaguing the franchise for 20 years, the Jackson firing could ultimately trigger a rapid descent back into NBA obscurity as soon as 2017. - Bleacher Report, 2014 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1651457-mark-jackson-firing-reveals-true-priorities-of-golden-state-warriors-ownership


**Steve Kerr is hired**

> Ownership has spun this into the notion that the two-headed combination of Myers and Lacob had had enough of the offense and personal interaction issues. Steve Kerr ostensibly solves both of these problems at once. And yet, this still leaves open the door to the question as to whether the credentials were worth going this high and blind, flying all the way to Oklahoma City after their Game 6, to woo the guy they wanted?
> Kerr was and is Lacob's guy all along. For whatever reason it may be, he got what he wanted.
> If the team desired offensive innovation they could simply go with Mike D'Antoni and bank on the defenders to keep playing at their requisite talent. If they wanted a fresh face with coaching experience and a fun offense, there was Fred Hoiberg. Hell, they were even ready to interview Lionel Hollins, a coach that ran into most of the same problems Jackson was a part of near the end of the season.
> But Lacob's comfortability and connections led him to the glitzy hire of Steve Kerr. We just don't know what was so glitzy to begin with. - SBNation/Warriors , May 2014,  http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2014/5/15/5719552/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-coach-lacob


**In comes Kevin Durant**

> Kevin Durant could join the Warriors this summer. That is possible because, in the 2016 NBA offseason, almost anything is possible. The $1 billion in salary cap space and the lack of bad long-term contracts around the league open doors that would have been inconceivable in almost any other year.
The notion of Durant, the offseason’s top free agent, joining the Warriors, the NBA’s top team, is simple enough, as Sporting News has explained in the past. The notion of Durant joining the other foremost Western Conference power, however, is more complicated and perhaps more interesting. - Sporting News, May, 2016  

> For the rest of this decade, any superstar has a better chance of making the Finals in the East. The West has Golden State, San Antonio, OKC (for now), the star-crossed Clippers, the savvy Blazers and the precocious T-Wolves lurking like Arya Stark. That’s a murderers’ row. The East has Cleveland (FYI: Year 14 for LeBron next season), Boston’s Collection of Awesome Assets That Can’t Translate to an Actual Contender Yet, Whatever Toronto Is, Whatever Atlanta Was, Whatever Orlando and Milwaukee Might End Up Being, Whatever Pat Riley Might Have up His Sleeve and that’s about it. (Sorry, Knicks fans.) You want an easier road to the title, go East. Or sign with the Warriors.Durant knows this. I promise you. He hasn’t made the Finals since 2012 for a variety of reasons: injuries, cheap owners, shaky coaching, bad luck, a stacked conference, and one dreadfully short-sighted trade (that’s becoming less and less dreadful as Steven Adams blossoms into a Kiwi warrior, but still). You can excuse all of those things and easily land at the following place: We should have won at least one title, it’s amazing that we didn’t, I can’t give up on this team yet. Admirable and understandable, especially for someone as loyal to fans and teammates as Durant has been. - The Ringer, June, 2016 https://theringer.com/kevin-durant-thunder-conundrum-4b1689d4002c


**Also keep in mind other teams had a chance at Kevin (Well, at least in thoery**

> The Thunder, Spurs and Warriors already have meetings set up, according to a report from The Vertical. The Los Angeles teams want face-to-face talks. So do Miami, Boston, Houston, and New York.
> Another agent thinks, in the case of Durant, the club that wants to pry him away from the Thunder “needs to be a good team, in a better market with a better chance to win than OKC.”
> “So Golden State and Miami become the only real players,” the agent said. “It's too hard to justify a move to Los Angeles (Lakers) or New York because they are not close to winning. Houston's out.”
> Durant won't be touring city-to-city. The Vertical reported that Durant and his representation will host meetings at an undisclosed location in NYC, the homebase of Roc Nation. LeBron James had a similar strategy in 2010 when he set up meetings for teams to come to him in northeastern Ohio.
> Not since James has a free agent been as highly coveted as Durant, to be able to control the entire tempo and pace of free agency. Another agent, however, thinks Durant's free agency will be different from James' in one regard: Durant isn't playing general manager. - NewsOk, June, 2016 http://newsok.com/article/5506480



**...and there you have it.**

The Warriors built up this so called ""Super Team"" by players that they drafted. Steph Curry was a first round pick, but there were still mixed feelings about him when he was drafted. Thompson was heralded, but people were worried about the weed arrest. Alot of people thought that neither one these players would be Stars. The trade of Monta Ellis for Bogut and others, was ridiculed at the time. Even I questioned that, because Ellis was really good at the time.  The Warriors go the playoffs two straight years , only to have Mark jackson be fired. At the time, I hated it. I thought it was stupid. I thought that the Warriors would regress because of this. Of course that was wrong. 

The Warriors have also picked up decent free agents along the way like Andre Iguodala and Shawn Livingston. Both ended up being great additions. The Warriors built their core through the draft and supplemented that through smart , veteran Free Agent picks. 

> Andre Iguodala won’t ever win an NBA championship until he’s paid correctly and plays with truly better players than himself on offense. It’s inconvenient for whatever team overpays him this summer, but it’s the truth. - HuffPost, July, 2013  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jake-fischer/the-incovenient-truth-abo_b_3530424.html



> Livingston is a beast of a defender, capable of handling both guard spots and most small forwards. His length, physicality and smarts make him yet another fantastic wing stopper on a Golden State roster that already has one of the league's best in Andre Iguodala.
> Slotting him into backcourt lineups alongside Stephen Curry will allow the Dubs to hide their franchise point guard on the weakest available matchup. And if the Dubs want to get particularly nasty on defense, they can put a flat-out-terrifying combination of Livingston, Iguodala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut on the floor together. - Bleacher Report, July, 2014 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2116632-does-shaun-livingston-signing-make-klay-thompson-more-expendable-for-warriors

The Warriors got to the state that they in by making shrewd moves. Fortunately for them , these moves paid off. Trades, Free Agents, Draft picks, Coach firings, it all could have went either way. This was not a team that went out and constructed a Big 3 in Free Agency. They drafted and groomed their Big 3 organically. Yes, they added Kevin Durant, but Durant had other suitors. He talked to other teams who did not do enough or have enough to wow him. The Warriors had the cap space and they signed the FREE agent. 

There was a void. Harrison Barnes was that void. We already know how bad he was in the Finals. The Warriors wanted to be able to beat the Cavs, so they got better. Kevin Durant is available and the job of every team is to constantly improve. The Warriors would be doing a disservice to themselves and their fans if they did not pursue him. He was free to choose and there was nothing wrong with this. 

There are fans who are now complaining and saying that the league needs to do something, but the Warriors did nothing wrong and Durant did nothing wrong. The Durant signing was there biggest Free Agent signing in years. This was a team built through the draft and I can't stress that enough.  I keep repeating that when Curry, Klay and Draymond were drafted  most did not see any of them being stars, so lets not act like these were overly hyped draft picks.

**The Warriors built their team the right way Its almost similar to how Jerry West helped build the Lakers in the late 90s/early 00s and then to go to the Warriors in 2011**

> After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award.[49] By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West laid down the fundamentals of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.[1] On May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber.[52][53] This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team.[54] In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive. - Jerry West, Wikipedia

the bottom line is, if other NBA teams want to win, then maybe they should follow the blueprint of the Golden State Warriors. You have a clear vision that you follow, you make smart draft picks, you build team chemistry even at the expense of trading favorite players (Ellis), you put smart basketball people in key positions in your franchise (West), You take chances at the Coaching position even if it doesnt make sense at the time (Kerr), you take chances and add players other teams dont  really want (Iggy, Livingston, Javelle), You make your team as a good as possible by going after and acquiring the best player in Free Agency when you have the chance (Durant).

It's going to be REALLY hard for Kevin Durant(or any other superstar) to pass on an opportunity like LA when they see that not only can they build a team around them as they did Kobe, but they are going to pay them later on in their career if they prove to deserve it; like Kobe did.

187,Why are so many people praising the Mavericks “culture” in light of the Porzingis trade?,26,anwilk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/anwilk/why_are_so_many_people_praising_the_mavericks/,155,1549521119,"It seems like there’s a lot of sentiment out there that the Mavericks have a stable Organization and they’ll be able to manage the relationship with Porzingis better than the Knicks did. While I don’t necessarily doubt that, why have the Mavericks been given the benefit of the doubt after what’s come out about that organization over the past year. 

They had a 7 month long investigation into their Organization, both front and back office, that concluded that they had been fostering sexual harassment for over two decades. Now in each Porzingis post I see so many upvoted comments about how well their front office communicates and how they have a tight circle of management. I know organizational disfunction doesn’t directly relate to player management but I reject the notion that those two aren’t correlated at all. 

Did everyone just forget that they just had probably the most disturbing NBA news story come out since the Donald Sterling fiasco? I just don’t understand the rose-colored glasses people are using when discussing the Mavericks “culture”. 

The NBA likes to fancy itself the most progressive major sports league but it sure seems like this whole scandal got brushed under the rug real quickly with minimal repercussions...

He's only 21 years old and he's averaging 13 & 10 with .660 shooting.  His raw numbers will obviously drop when Turner returns but it's obvious the talent is there, he just needed the opportunity.

He played 81 games last year and had a double-double in only TWO games.  This year he already has 4 in 7 games played.  In tonight's game against the Kings he was 1 rebound shy of getting a double double in the first quarter alone.

> Man, it's hilarious that THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS are harping on alleged disrespect.

Everything he said to seems pretty much to be the same attitude he's had for a while.

**Atlanta Hawks**

With Blazers

Receive- Anfernee Simmons, Gary Trent Jr. 2019 2nd rd pick

Give- Taurean Prince 

Reasoning- The Blazers add a wing to take minutes from Turner and Moe Harkless, who have both been questionable. Prince gives them a solid defensive presence. The Hawks add 2 young pieces and help the tankathon, Prince likely isn't in their future plans anyway.

**Boston Celtics**

With Pelicans

Receive- Anthony Davis, Wesley Johnson

Give- Jaylen Brown, Kings 2019 1st, Clippers 2019 1st, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojelye 

Reasoning, I understand this trade is ridiculous, but finding a trade for the Celtics is really hard when they don't have any holes. Exploring trades with Rozier is kind of difficult because he's the only bench PG for the Celtics and they need the depth. For the Pelicans, this deal would avoid a long turnover process and you get the deal in before it turns into a Jimmy Butler to move up 6 spots in the draft and some filler, or boogie cousins for a centerpiece around Buddy Hield

**Brooklyn Nets**

with 76ers

Receive- Fultz, Korkmaz

Give- Dudley, Dinwiddie

Reasoning- Dinwiddie is expiring and the Nets get a high potential prospect for pretty cheap, all things considered, they need to see if DRuss can handle a full-time pg role before they pay him anyway. For the 76ers, they get a much needed shooter and just added bench scoring with dinwiddie, or he could start, but I would like to see Dinwiddie on a playoff team.

**Charlotte Hornets**

With Suns

Receive- Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Ryan Anderson

Give- Kemba Walker, Nicholas Batum

Reasoning- Although I don't think they trade Kemba, and there's a good case for why they shouldn't; the Hornets are capitalizing on Kemba's highest value as they not only pull 2 young guys with good potential. Even if Jackson has been bad so far, he still has a decent ceiling and Bridges is a young asset. They also save 4m in cap room the next 2 years and get out of the contract 1 year sooner with the Anerson for Batum swap. The Suns fill out they're backcourt with a dominant scorer. 

**Chicago Bulls**

With Wizards

Receive- Kelly Oubre Jr.

Give- Bobby Portis

All about needs here, as the Wizards need to fill a hole at big man, especially how bad they are rebounding right now and the Bulls, although they don't need wing scoring, Oubre isn't an awful defender and probably gives them a better SF option that Justin Holiday, Denzel Valentine or Chandler Hutchinson.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

With Houston Rockets

Receive- Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss

Give- George Hill

For the Cavs, they get to essentially shave a year off of Hill's contract with Knight and Chriss expiring, also they get to see if they want to hold on to Chriss, who could be a rotational guy in the future. For the Rockets, they get a much needed consistent 3rd ball-handler, they can stop forcing MCW out there.

**Detroit Pistons**

With Charlotte Hornets

Receive- Kemba Walker

Give- Ish Smith, Luke Kennard, Khyri Thomas, 2019 1st, 2021 1st (top 3 protected)

For the Pistons, they get their big 3 so to speak and give themselves a 2nd legitimate scoring option. For the Horents, they get a young shooter in Kennard, but also 2 1sts that can help them rebuild once they get out of these awful contracts, a pistons team in 2021 could be very bad if Blake doesn't keep this season up and who knows if Kemba stays in Detroit. 

**Indiana Pacers**

with Wizards

Receive- Bradley Beal, Kelly Oubre Jr.

Give- Myles Turner, Cory Joseph, Thaddeus Young, 2019 1st

Reasoning- The Pacers seem to not have anyone adding a ton of production behind Oladipo, Sabonis and the occasional Bogdanovic momentum 3 ball. Adding Beal would give them another deep scoring option on a good contract. The Wizards pull out a solid young center that can be a piece for the future and possibly help Wall right some of his wrongs, cause I think losing Gortat hurts Wall more than the public, or Wall, thinks. They also get a 1st in the deal and keep relevance this season with 3 guys that can play.

**Miami Heat**

With Rockets

Give- James Johnson, Justice Winslow

Get, Brandon Knight, 2019 1st

Reasoning- Heat get out of the Johnson deal in style, acquiring a 1st round pick in the process, Knight being expiring doesn't really hurt them in the long run and I don't know if they planned on resigning Winslow anyway. For the Rockets, they get deeper to start and add 2 guys that can defend how they like, in a way replacing Trevor Ariza, obviously not quite the shooters like Ariza was at points but regardless adding wing defenders is never a bad idea.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

With Magic

Give- Tony Snell, 2019 1st

Get- Evan Fournier

Reasoning- For the bucks, it's fairly obvious, they add another wing scoring option that can fit directly into their lineup. Fournier might be having an off year so far but he's a pretty solid guard that can add a good bit to their lineup, possibly can play the Korver role in Bud's offense. For the Magic, they don't really need Fournier, he's also at 17m and taking Snell cuts 7m off of that, adding the 1st round pick is exciting for the team as well. 

**New York Knicks**

With Kings

Give- Courtney Lee, 2020 1st

Get- Iman Shumpert, Harry Giles

Reasoning- For the Knicks, they get more money, for what they hope is a big offseason by unloading Courtney Lee's 2 year contract and they add a decent young guy in Harry Giles. For the Kings, they get to watch as the Knicks swing and miss on every free agent in 2019 and are back in the lottery in 2020. 

**Orlando Magic**

With Pelicans

Give- Terrance Ross

Receive- Soloman Hill, 2019 2nd

Reasoning- A small trade here that nets the Magic a 2nd rounder and gives the Pelicans some added 3pt shooting. Hill and Ross are both expiring, so the money isn't really impacted either way.

**Philadephia 76ers**

With Bulls

Give- Markelle Fultz

Get- Bobby Portis, Cam Payne

Reasoning- The 76ers likely can solve their issue at back up center with adding Portis and open up enough money this offseason for a max player. Probably the most they'll get for Fultz. Cam Payne just to make salaries work, he's an expiring anyway. The Bulls just lose a piece that probably wasn't going to help them win this season and get a lottery ticket in Markelle

**Toronto Raptors**

With Trail Blazers

Give- Norman Powell

Get- Al Faruq-Aminu, Caleb Swanigan

Reasoning- Making a trade for the Raptors is very difficult because they're filled out, but Norm has been a question mark this year and I suppose getting a consistent stretch 4/wing helps them and Swanigan can provide depth at the big spot if they're in a pinch. The Blazers, get a wing to take minutes away from Turner and Harkless.

**Washington Wizards**

With Heat

Give- John Wall

Get- Goran Gragic

Reasoning- The Wizards escape the Wall contract in the final year they can while likely not dropping off too much and who knows, possibly new blood can help the team turn something around. For the Heat they give Wall a fresh a start, they seem to be a team content with being decent and just hovering in the playoffs until something breaks for them and Wall could help give them that, even at a bad contract, you don't get a player at Wall's caliber any cheaper and I think he could be better in Miami than Washington.

**Dallas Mavericks**

With Heat

Give- J.J. Barea, Ray Spalding

Get- Justice Winslow

Reasoning- The Mavs need a wing defender, they simply are lacking someone that can lock up the wing consistently and although they hate to move Barea, They open up minutes for Brunson and still have Devin Harris. Meanwhile the Heat don't have a true back up point, Tyler Johnson can run it, but their team would look a lot better if he could play off ball full time. 

**Denver Nuggets**

With Grizzlies

Give- Mason Plumlee, Jarred Vanderbilt

Get- Garret Temple, Marshon Brooks, Ivan Rabb

Reasoning- I couldn't find a trade for the Nuggets for the life of me, please forgive this trade, I guess they get a 2nd ball handler in Garret Temple, but like I said I really could not find a logical trade for the nuggets

**Golden State Warriors**

With Cavaliers

Give- Quinn Cook, Jacob Evans, 2019 1st

Get- Larry Nance Jr.

Reasoning, Nance gives them an athletic 4 that can play the 5 in a pinch and possible protection if Draymond leaves for more depth at that spot. Losing the 30th pick, Quinn Cook and Jacob Evans doesn't really hurt them and the Cavs push toward tanking and add another draft pick to help fill out their roster next year for what should be another tankathon.

**Houston Rockets**

With Knicks

Give- Brandon Knight, Zhou Qi, 2019 1st

Get- Tim Hardaway Jr.

Reasoning- The Rockets need more rotational guys, if Hardaway can simply play in the playoffs for them he helps them immensely, he can be the spot up shooter that melo wasn't. For the Knicks they open up a lot of money this upcoming season and get a late 1st, which gives them the ability to turn this offseason into a big one.

**Los Angeles Clippers**

With Trail Blazers

Give- Patrick Beverley, Sindarious Thornwell

Get- Zach Collins, Jake Layman

Reasoning- The Clippers are another tough team to find a trade for cause their plan is pretty well laid out at this point. However this trade gives them another young piece to their already rich core. And for the Blazers they get a much needed defending guard and a ball handler definitely doesn't hurt them.

**Los Angeles Lakers**

With Suns

Give- Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, 2019 1st

Get- Devin Booker

Reasoning- Yes this is absurd, yes this will never happen but it actually has some logic on paper. It's hard to make a reasonable trade for the lakers right now because so many guys are restricted from trades due to being signed recently. So the Lakers obviously get a great young player who will be able to get his own 30 and take the load off of LeBron but i'm sure thats not the part that fans are upset about. The Suns might see that Ingram has been close to as good as Booker the past 2 seasons and Kuzma is what Kuzma is but is still young, they get to widen their young core. I know they would never do this but it's more of a thought provoking trade cause I can't make a real one based on reasons thrown out at the beginning.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

With Mavericks

Give- Chandler Parsons, 2021 1st

Get- Wesley Matthews, J.J. Barea

Reasoning- The Grizzlies get out of the Parsons contract and open up their room for someone next season, and add J.J. Barea this season, an improvement over Mack. Matthews isn't bad either. The Mavericks could use an extra 1st after losing one to go get Doncic.

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

With Hornets

Get- Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lamb

Give- Tyus Jones, Taj Gibson, 2019 1st

Reasoning- T-Wolves get a star and complete their lineup with Kemba, Wiggins, Covington, Saric and Towns. Improving from Teague. And they add Lamb as a solid piece. The Hornets add a young player, and expiring contract and what should be a draft pick in the early 20's possibly late teens, not a bad haul for the UConn guard.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

With Knicks

Give- Soloman Hill, Cheick Diallo, 2019 1st

Give- Tim Hardaway Jr.

Reasoning- The Kicks get a 1st for a contract they probably don't want all that much now, and the Pelicans get a good wing to help outside. It helps possibly convince AD to stay as well. 

**Oklahoma City Thunder**

With Kings and Spurs

Give- Andre Roberson to Spurs, Hamidou Diallo, 2020 & 2021 2nd to Kings

Get- Bodgan Bogdanovich

Spurs give Patty Mills to Kings

Reasoning- This is assuming the Kings come back down into the mid to low lottery, but they add Diallo, who honestly has been pretty decent in limited minutes, adding 2 2nds and getting 9m this offseason due to Patty Mills expiring. The Thunder's defense has been good without Roberson and I think they're going to want to continue giving Ferguson minutes, adding a shooter really helps them and they can trot out a much better starting 5. The Spurs need something defensively and badly, they rank 29th in defensive rtg and Roberson you'd imagine helps that, Derrick White and Bryn Forbes can handle PG for a bit at least. Derozan would probably be the primary ball handler though.

**Phoenix Suns**

With Pacers

Give- T.J. Warren

Get- Thaddeus Young, 2020 1st

Reasoning- The suns get a draft pick that probably won't be high but still adds an asset, I don't know if Warren exactly fits with their time table. Young has had a bad season so far and if you're the Pacers, Warren is a very versatile forward that can score pretty easily. He helps their chances this season a lot.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

With Nets

Give- Al-Faruq Aminu, Wade Baldwin, 2019 2nd

Get- D'Angelo Russell

Reasoning- This is assuming the Nets don't plan on bringing back Russell, which I don't think they do and he goes elsewhere this summer, so at least they get something of value for him. Baldwin is a young asset and a 2nd round pick never hurt, also this is a assuming they aren't part of the playoff picture in the near future. For the Blazers, they finally get a good bench guard where they are lacking heavily, losing aminu sucks, cause I like Aminu, but they still have Zach Collins and Leonard, who play that 4 spot a lot. 

**Sacramento Kings**

With Rockets

Give- Willy Cauley-Stien

Get- Marquese Chriss, Zhou Qi

Reasoning- The kings definitely aren't bringing back Cauley-Stien anyway, so why not turn him into 2 more young guys for your team? also helps with the whole tanking thing, assuming they will be back there this season. If they continue how they have been this trade isn't logical. For the Rockets, they are mediocre in points in the paint allowed and at the very least Cauley-Stien is an option to help that without giving up much at all for him.

**San Antonio Spurs**

With Trail Blazers

Give- LaMarcus Aldridge

Get- Evan Turner, Zach Collins, Wade Baldwin, 2019 1st, 2021 2nd

Reasoning- If the Spurs start to falter, they might not want to be in that Aldridge deal for long, and adding Collins, Baldwin and a 1st can help restart this. The Spurs are hard to find a trade for due to their recently signed players and not clear direction quite yet so the trade is more so of an idea that I think they could pursue. 

**Utah Jazz**

With Wizards

Give- Ricky Rubio, Thabo Sefolosha, Tony Bradley, 2019, 2021 1st

Get- Bradley Beal

Reasoning- Jazz get a solid extra scorer, in an offense that seems stagnant if Mitchell is cold. Mitchell moving to point could be good for the offense as Rubio has seen plenty of troubles this season and we have seen the Mitchell at PG work in the playoffs last season. I think it gives their lineup a lot more options. For the Wizards, if they want to blow it up, this might be the way to do it. They get to take away all of Beal's money while adding 2 1st round picks.

He is doing unspeakable things to NBA teams and taking his team to the number 1 seed over the more talented Warriors team. Also wears Wesley Johnson’s ankles as a necklace. Harden is twice as good as Steph at drawing fouls and contact, a very valuable asset in a player because it puts the opposing teams best defenders in foul trouble. He leads the league in three point makes and is shooting 39% at the same volume of 3s as Curry. He absolutely stuffs the stat sheet in ways Curry cannot do, rebounding, assisting and scoring much more than Curry over the last 4 years. He’s also only assisted on 30% of his baskets, while Curry hovers at around 60% assisted.

Curry is the definition of efficiency. He has the highest true shooting percentage of a guard of all time currently. He’s second in the league in 3 point makes, but on 3% higher efficiency than Harden and about 6 fewer games played. He’s got two MVPs, one unanimous and has seen the NBA Finals 3 times, conquering them twice in the process. He consistently leads the league in box +/-, RPM, VORP, and a slew of other advanced stats. His reputation as the greatest shooter of all time gives him a special gravity that opens up the floor for his teammates that not many in NBA history can make claim to.

This isn't a knock against him, but all these posts about him being GOAT, him being the league's best player (ignoring LeBron, Curry, Durant, Harden, etc.), can't help but shake my head.

Maybe he ends up being the game's greatest winner (like this generation's version of Bill Russell), but he isn't good enough individually at this point to top the stats and accolades of LeBron, Harden, Durant and Curry. Being the greatest winner is different from being the best player.

Before anyone says ""hurr durr stats don't mean anything"", clearly, they mean something, else why would be keeping them? Stats matter in context to performance. Kawhi doesn't have the stats yet. And if he continues all this load management crap, he won't ever. Seriously, take a look at the career stats of everyone I mentioned above and compare with Kawhi's. Statistically, this year was Kawhi's best season, and they're not even eye-popping in comparison to everyone else's best season. And he only did them in 60 games! 

Everyone else is an anomaly or stat freak. **You need to be both a stat freak and ALSO be a winner to be top player-worthy**, much less GOAT-worthy.

The Lakers no longer have a great second max contract option this summer since CP3, PG13, and Durant have all re-upped.  

They sign Lebron for a max 1+1 and he gets to buddy up with Carmelo for a year.  They don’t make the Kawhi trade, and use it as a feeling-out year to see which of the young guys fit well next to Bron, and how well Walton and Bron fit.  Low pressure, low expectations in year 1.  This is a non-playoff year and the Lakers will have their own ‘19 pick.  

Then in the summer of ‘19 they re-sign Lebron, sign Kawhi to a max, and use those two Thunder future first-rounders and their own future first rounders add a third elite player that is already under contract somewhere else.  

At that point - summer of ‘19 - Deng’s deal would only have one year remaining, and cap space opens wide up next year with the cap going up 7 million and many bad deals going off the books.  The Lakers could use the final year of Deng’s deal and those future Thunder first-rounders to add another elite player under contract with another team (an opted in and traded Jimmy Butler or Khris Middleton for example).  

This plan would mean the Lakers were probably a non-playoff team in 18-19 with Lebron and Carmelo, but set themselves up to be loaded in 19-20:

Lebron, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler or Middleton, AND all their current young guys, who still wouldn’t be expensive yet.  

The Thunder would do that Carmelo deal because it would save them $100M+ in repeater tax bills next year.

The first was LeBron putting pressure on the paint and scoring or opening up the 3 point attack. The other was the CONSISTENT iso scoring Kyrie Irving would provide against any defender in the NBA. Despite the stories, LeBron didn't have to do too much in any game to win (by his standards, of course). On a good night, all LeBron had to do was get 20 to 25 and Kyrie could guarantee 20 to 30 points (Love would sprinkle in 15 to 20) with Isolations and transition. Lue didn't really have to design an offensive system because so much scoring was guaranteed from 3 players. Believe it or not, LeBron had the easiest time he's had in his NBA career. Even in Miami, Wade's non-shooting clogged the paint. Now in Cleveland, LeBron's workload was cut in half with the spacing and iso scoring Kyrie provided. Kyrie led the Cavs in shots and usage last year because of it. Kyrie in Cleveland would have extended LeBron's career to the max because he could literally stand still and watch Kyrie Iso. Now, everything looks difficult for  Cleveland. No one can mimic what Kyrie did for the Cavs. In fact, only James Harden could possibly fill that Shooting/ISO void for LeBron. The sad part is that a 25-year-old LeBron could run this team to 60 wins, but he doesn't have the energy to score 30 and get open shots for the shooter every night.

This could be from a player, coach, or purely academic perspective. Please do not include the potential for beer involved in billiards, darts or bowling as a factor.

I would be willing to bet that most people here would rank basketball, football, hockey and soccer in the top 4. People like team sports. People also like sports that involve a myriad of skills and actions. The more variables that affect success in a game, provided those variables work together in an interpret-able and logical way, the more fun it is. I am not stating that as fact, but as an opinion that it probably does not take a leap of faith for most of you to agree with. 

Basketball is a game that involves so many skills. Jump shooting, Set shooting, lay-ups, dunks, passing, dribbling, rebounding, posting up... I could go on for a long time. But not every player can do each one at the same level. What makes basketball beautiful is the team-work can make imperfect players play the game at near perfect levels. 

- Dirk Nowitzki? That can't rebound well or protect the rim for shit. Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler? World champions. 

- Steph Curry? Guy is great on one side of the ball, but he's so weak he gets beat just as bad on the other end. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green? Well, shit, we don't have *4 guys* who can torch him. 

- LeBron James? He is the most rounded player ever, but his jump shot is pretty inconsistent - he's only a good scorer if he is getting to the rack. LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Shane Battier, Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers? How you gonna stop that man when there is nobody even near the rack?!?!

You can probably see my point. Every player, even LeBron, has strengths and weakness. The beauty of basketball is finding a way to leverage peoples' greatness and cover for their weakness to put the best possible product on the floor. That's why I love it, at least. 

Because of dumb, outdated fouling rules, there is one skill that a team cannot find a way to mask. DeAndre Jordan is probably just as bad at dribbling as he is at shooting, but that doesn't keep him out of the game because his team is full of playmakers. Ricky Rubio couldn't finish a happy meal, but as long as his teammates can they have a chance. But if a player can't make FTs the other team can eliminate the relevance of every other skill in the game. You can't even stop the other team from putting your player on the line by not giving him the ball. You literally have to take him out of the game. How ridiculous is that? 

People talk about DeAndre and Dwight as if they are some extreme outliers that are the only source of the issue. As if its a sheer matter of practice that is holding him back, and that's on him. But there have always been and always will be lots of good basketball players that struggle with FTs, as there are lots who struggle with defense.  Most of these guys aren't factors in playoff series so they don't face hack-a too often, but if they were the Plumlees, Drummond, Whiteside, Sanders, Perkins, Ed Davis, Mahinmi would all face the issue. Dwight and DeAndre are so damn good at everything else that they are the only two players whose lack of touch doesn't prevent them from being stars on playoff teams. They aren't being punished for being outliers for their bad FT shooting, they are being punished for being too good at everything else (or some other things, more accurately). 

Basketball will always be a sport where great teams are more than the sum of their parts because teammates can make up for any weaknesses. If you support current Hack-A-Shaq rules, you are effectively saying that applies to everything except FT shooting.

If you really feel that way, go watch darts. Its basically the same fucking thing. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold and thanks for all the good discussion. It has come to my attention that the reason people are so committed to the ""learn to make you free throws"" defense is because people think that FTs are just a matter of fundamentals and practice, unlike many other skills which require certain genetic traits. Maybe this is the case because a lot of  people don't ever get into basketball without playing it to a degree, and most average height people don't play much unless they have a pretty good natural shooting stroke. I dunno, that seems far-fetched, but its gotta be something.

As a 6'8 (out of shoes, so NBA 6'10"") forward who is wet from mid range and even 3, but has always struggled from the line, I assure you that is not the case. FT shooting is definitely something you can improve, but the range is absolutely different for different people. While DJ's 43% seems particularly low, a lot of really good players have been poor FT shooters and to question all of their work ethic is pretty presumptuous.",0.5,controversial,7/14/15 19:48

#Western Conference

1. **Houston Rockets**, 58-24. This Russ/Harden combo is going underrated, and the Rockets have potential for another magnificent regular season like their 65-17 season two years ago. That probably won't happen again, but CP3 -> Russ upgrade is still pretty significant, both because CP3 is starting to decline and because he has had availability issues. Russ helps to mitigate some issues and is good on defense as well as athleticism. The Rockets have also returned their core players (Gordon/Tucker/Capela/etc.) so there is still some continuity. 
2. **Denver Nuggets**, 56-26. Denver is high-key really good, and MPJ is looking great in preseason. Unless he proves that he can stay healthy, he won't be a difference maker, but who knows at this point? The Nuggets' young players should hopefully continue to grow, and hopefully Jamal doesn't go full Wiggins after securing the bag.
3. **Utah Jazz**, 55-27. The Jazz have upgraded significantly this offseason by adding a borderline All-Star in Conley and then also adding Bojan, who was a big factor for the Pacers staying afloat after Oladipo's injury last year. With a good amount of depth, the Jazz should be in the upper tier of the regular season teams.
4. **Golden State Warriors**, 52-30. Note that this ranking assumes a healthy Curry (75+ games) and that Klay returns after All-Star break. If not, they will be a lot lower. With healthy Curry, the Warriors are still contenders. Expect him to put up insane numbers this year and carry harder than any non-Harden player has done in recent memory. They could pull a trade for D'Lo since I don't expect him to mesh that well with GS's system when Klay comes back, but it depends on how he does.
5. **Los Angeles Lakers**, 51-31. One extended injury to LeBron forcing another January vacation or to Anthony Day to Davis could throw the Lakers out of the playoffs. The Lakers will practice some load management either way to keep their stars healthy for the playoffs, so don't expect them to be in the top part of the standings. Don't let their record deceive you, though -- come playoff time, the Lakers are firmly in the upper echelon of the league, with an outstanding duo (if healthy) and good complimentary pieces.
6. **Los Angeles Clippers**, 50-32. The Clippers will manage the hell out of Kawhi's load after seeing how that worked out for the Raptors last year. He'll probably play 60 games or so, and given that Paul George will miss probably a month or so at the start of the season, we will not see the full extent of what the Clippers can do until the playoffs. Like the Lakers, don't let their record deceive you. Fully healthy and non-load managing, the Clippers are contenders.
7. **Dallas Mavericks**, 47-35. Their record also depends on health and load management as KP comes back from his ACL injury. However, the roster is solid enough to keep them afloat even with some management, as Luka has proven to be able to carry the team at points, and if we get a jump from him, this seeding is definitely realistic for the Mavs. The bench is also fairly deep, especially with Point God JJ Barea's early return from injury. The Mavs will surprise people, and could even have two All-Stars.
8. **Portland Trail Blazers**, 45-37. This last spot is a tossup between several good teams, but Portland, with the best player among all of them, gets the nod. Lillard is still an elite PG and should keep the team rolling despite the loss of Nurkic and some roster overhaul. I don't like a lot of their roster moves this offseason (losing Kanter is big for them, who stepped up majorly after Nurkic went down, Whiteside and old af Pau won't fill that role much), though, so I don't expect them to do as well as they did last year.
9. **San Antonio Spurs**, 44-38. I keep thinking that it's finally gonna happen, but Pop proves me wrong each year. This year, unfortunately, is probably when that magical run ends. The west has too many teams for the Spurs to keep defying odds each time, although still expect the Spurs to have a winning record, of course. DeMar is great but not that All-NBA player that took the Raptors to the #1 seed anymore, and LMA is very good for his age but how long can he keep it up? The rest of the roster is good, with a lot of solid pieces, but not good enough to be top 8 this year, most likely.
10. **Sacramento Kings**, 42-40. The Kings will push through with a winning record for the first time in quite a while, but as is the case with the Spurs, the west is too stacked for them to make it into the playoffs. I do think the Kings need another piece to add to their current core before they can expect to contend for the playoffs, so it might be better off for them to stay in the lottery this year, honestly.
11. **New Orleans Pelicans**, 38-44. The Pelicans are good on paper, but giving plenty of their key minutes to young players/rookies will probably not do them very well when trying to make a playoff push. This is a playoff team in the east for sure (probably on Orlando's tier, with a good crowd of young players and established vet All-Stars in Jrue/Vuc) but in the west, not so much. I'm excited to see Zion throughout the regular season, and I think he can be massive for them going forward, both literally and figuratively.
12. **Oklahoma City Thunder**, 35-47. The roster looks alright, but let's be honest: Gallo is trade bait and will certainly not be on the team anymore post-trade deadline, and same deal with Adams. CP3 will be on the team solely because his contract is an albatross, and OKC would have to part with assets to acquire him unless it's for Wall or Wiggins straight up. Now that we mention it... Wiggins on OKC would be interesting. Would he be a permanent MVP-level player now? But either way, the Thunder are not a playoff team, but certainly not bad. They will keep close to .500 pre-trade deadline, most likely.
13. **Phoenix Suns**, 31-51. I'm hyped to see Ayton this year, and I think he could continue developing into a true beast that makes people stop asking why the Suns didn't draft Luka. The roster is improved from last year, no doubt, with the additions of Saric and Rubio. These are not season-changing players, but in the case of the Suns, who need a PG desperately, Rubio may make a huge impact that launches the team past the 30-win mark.
14. **Minnesota Timberwolves**, 28-54. Let's be honest, this team is ass outside of KAT and RoCo. The Butler trade was a huge mistake -- if they didn't make it, they'd be working with KAT, LaVine, and Lauri to build around (and maybe Wiggins might be good in this hypothetical timeline), but now they are straight up wasting KAT's early years. The Wolves will probably take this season to grab another high draft pick, because they are probably not going to sniff the playoffs this year. Without KAT, this team is probably worst in the league.
15. **Memphis Grizzlies**, 25-57. Bad this year, but with a bright future. The roster is also bad, although they have multiple young studs in Ja, JJJ, and Valanciunas. They will probably finish worst in the west without a Booker or KAT-level player to carry them out of the cellar. It would also be nice to convey the protected (top 6) pick to Boston this year so they can go forward without any pick obligations, but if they vault to #1 or something, they certainly won't complain.

#Eastern Conference

1. **Milwaukee Bucks**, 57-25. The Bucks are a deep team, and Giannis is looking to go on a revenge tour after getting bounced in the ECF. The team is worse than last year due to the loss of Brogdon, but made up for it in part with some decent signings (other Lopez, Korver, Wes Matthews), so they should still be elite in the regular season. 
2. **Philadelphia 76ers**, 54-28. The 76ers are going to be very good, but I think they are being a little overrated here on r/nba. The Bucks are still better all-around, and losing Butler will be big for Philly, who relied on him a lot to close games. The defense will be very good, but I'm skeptical of their ability to earn the #1 seed.
3. **Boston Celtics**, 50-32. If the Celtics have a fully healthy Hayward, they can challenge one of the top two teams in the playoffs. If he's similar to last year, not so much. The Celtics are very weak in the middle, and expect them to swing a trade for some good center this year. Other than that, they are probably not going to be better than last year.
4. **Miami Heat**, 47-35. The Heat will be pretty good with Butler -- not contenders, but due to how weak the east is, they will get a good seed. Their roster is solid this year, although I don't have much else to say about them other than that they will be good. 
5. **Orlando Magic**, 46-36. I'm excited to see Fultz hopefully have a bounce-back season and lead the Magic to a good seed in the playoffs. Isaac will continue to progress, as will AG and hopefully Bamba. Vucevic is still an All-Star, and will probably repeat as one if the Magic are this high when it comes time for voting. I think the Magic are a dark horse and could go as high as the 3rd seed if everything goes right.
6. **Toronto Raptors**, 45-37. While the defending champions, the Raptors did lose, of course, their best player and another very important piece to their success, so they will probably not have a top seed, but are going to return to the playoffs nonetheless. They may part with some of their non-Lowry core (Ibaka, Gasol) in trades if they get a good enough offer.
7. **Indiana Pacers**, 44-38. With Oladipo out for some time, don't expect the Pacers to be as high as they were pre-injury last year (3rd). Losing Bojan also hurts a lot, but Brogdon and Warren helps a bit. If Oladipo makes a timely return, the Pacers should be back in the playoffs, although if he stays out too long, they are in danger.
8. **Brooklyn Nets**, 44-38. Also a good team, but without KD, I don't expect them to land too high. If KD is back in the playoffs, then things could change, but I don't think the Nets will risk it by bringing him back early. Now if he was healthy the whole season at 100%, the Nets would probably be a 2nd seed.
9. **Detroit Pistons**, 43-39. The Pistons look good, but unfortunately, with 9 playoff-caliber teams in the east, one has to miss out, and it's most likely to be Detroit. Note that the 4 to 9 seeds are all within 4 games, so a lot can change with injuries. I see the top 3 as fixed, but 4-9 is fluid and there are definitely some scenarios where the Pistons can be in the picture (Magic young guys regress, Raptors suck, Oladipo takes too long to come back, Kyrie is cancer again, etc.).
10. **Chicago Bulls**, 31-51. The Bulls lost 60 games last year, so expecting a bigger jump from that is probably expecting a little too much. Regardless, they will be a lot better, with some decent offseason acquisitions as well as a full season of OPJ (who made the team look a lot better after being traded). 
11. **Atlanta Hawks**, 29-53. The Hawks are still in rebuild mode as evidenced by some of their moves (trading for Parsons, for one) and the fact that rookies and young guys will get a lot of minutes. I don't expect them to improve record-wise from last year, but they will nonetheless be fun to watch.
12. **New York Knicks**, 26-56. The New York Power Forwards will be less bad than last year, but still bad. And that's fine. You can't really expect a team giving major minutes to DSJ and Kevin Knox (among other young guys) to make the playoffs. Nonetheless, they will be fun to watch like the Hawks.
13. **Cleveland Cavaliers**, 22-60. One of the true cellar teams of the east who are not going into the season with the idea of winning games. With a Garland/Sexton backcourt, you can't really expect them to win a lot of games, either, but that's fine for now, as they are rebuilding. Maybe the god of #1 picks will be with them again.
14. **Washington Wizards**, 20-62. Also another very bad team. Outside of Beal, who's their 2nd option? Rui Hachimura? The Wizards will lose a lot of games. A lot of games, I tell you. The Wizards will hold out on bringing Wall back since there's really no point this year. 
15. **Charlotte Hornets**, 15-67. The highest PPG last season of anyone currently on the team was 10.1.

#Draft Lottery

As a bonus, I'll simulate the draft lottery using the standings above and the adjusted lottery odds.

The way I did it was by drawing out the lottery odds in the form of a table on Excel and following standard procedures by randomly tiebreaking and splitting the odds. Next, I assigned a range of values to every lottery team based on the adjusted lottery odds for this season, which are seen below. The number of possible values correspond to the number of combinations each team has in the lottery.

1. Charlotte: 1-140
2. Washington: 141-280 
3. Cleveland: 281-420
4. Memphis: 421-545
5. New York: 536-650
6. Minnesota: 651-740
7. Atlanta: 731-815
8. Chicago: 816-875
9. Phoenix: 876-920
10. OKC: 921-950
11. New Orleans: 951-970
12. Detroit: 971-985
13. Sacramento: 986-995
14. San Antonio: 996-1000

Then, I generated four random numbers using an RNG and assigned them to the #1, #2, #3, and #4 picks respectively. Here's the draft order for the outcome I generated.

1. Charlotte
2. Memphis
3. Cleveland
4. Minnesota
5. Washington
6. New York
7. and the rest stays like the pre-lottery order above

Two of these fouls were intentional at the end of the game, but the foul differential for the quarter finished at 13-5. 11-5 before intentional fouls. 

Along with a questionable no call on the final Embiid layup, Sixers fans would be justified in feeling like the refs screwed them down the stretch.

Given how badly the Lakers Front Office have botched the Anthony Davis trade already, I have zero confidence they will be able to build a contender around Anthony Davis. LeBron will decline like Kobe and AD will become sick of his melodramatic act real quick. Frank Vogel (like Mike Antoni) is too weak willed to be able to manage all of the egos of LA while being back-stabbed by Jason Kidd and front-stabbed by Lionel Hollins at the same time.

Following a quick exit in the playoffs, Anthony Davis (like Dwight Howard before him) will grow tired of the overrated LA lifestyle and leave to go elsewhere. Whether that be Golden State, Philadelphia, or some other rising young contending team. (Again, like Dwight Howard and the Rockets).

Feel free to recall this thread a year from now if I turn out to be wrong but I am strong in my convictions.

220,CMV/Unpopular Opinion: Lebron isn't at fault for coaching and GM decisions.,0,8uvyri,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8uvyri/cmvunpopular_opinion_lebron_isnt_at_fault_for/,27,1530329640,"I didn't know how to neatly sum up my view in the title, so I'll explain it here more clearly. I have seen a lot of posts and comments involving Lebron, acting like he's a player-coach-GM. The common argument for him being coach is that Ty Lue doesn't do much coaching and Lebron is pretty much the leader of the team and carries the team all the way despite the lack of coaching. The argument for him being a GM is that he campaigned for teammates to get nice contracts and the GMs and owners cave in to that. In short, the basic argument is that Lebron takes over the team when he joins. That's not what I have an issue with; I think this is true. 

But I don't buy this argument: People like to act like they can put the blame on Lebron when he's dealing with bad players on his team because ""well, he campaigned for their contracts,"" or that they can put the blame on Lebron when Ty Lue makes a bad coaching decision because ""well he wanted Blatt fired and vouched for Lue."" 

[When Lebron was with the Miami Heat, he wanted Spoelstra fired.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2611328-miami-heat-minority-owner-claims-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired) Pat Riley stuck by his guy. [Hell, it even sounds like Lebron really wanted Pat Riley to take over as coach](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23088267/pat-riley-said-lebron-james-did-right-thing-left-miami-nba) but Pat Riley stood by his convictions in 2011 and let Coach Spo lead his team to two rings. And Pat Riley talks about being angry when Lebron left, and then he talks about being able to see things from Lebron's point of view and understanding why he made the decision to go back to Cleveland. And hey, Lebron got his revenge by winning a ring in Cleveland after Riley and he reportedly had a heated exchange before they left, AKA Lebron's ""extra motivation."" 

What I'm saying is, coaching is a job. Being a GM is a job. And being a player is a job that is answerable to some degree to their coach and to their GM. We, as employees, all would like to have the guy that we're comfortable with or that we respect be our coach, and we would like to be able to call the shots on how our work operates. If it were up to me, I would go into my job looking for a 4 day work-week of 10 hours rather than a 5 day work week of 8 hours. Unfortunately, I don't have the clout that Lebron James has. 

And I think that being a mature GM and a mature coach is about having that clout. [Brad Stevens, who most agree is already one of the best coaches in the league right now, talked about how he doesn't want to tank](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2018/05/boston_celtics_never_tanked_pe.html). He talked about wanting to be able to have a squad where even if one person goes down, they can build around the rest and still be successful. And he proved that this season by defying expectations even though the two best on his team went down. Why do I bring this up? Because let's say if Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward or Al Horford decided to have the attitude where they walk in and say ""hey I want to fire Brad"" or say ""hey I want this contract for this guy"" and threaten to leave otherwise, Brad Stevens would try to work things out, but in the end, Danny Ainge and Brad would be able to shut the door on the conversation, let the door close on Al Horford without giving in, and not look back. 

At the end of the day, Lebron James is most definitely the best player in this league, and one of the best all time. But that doesn't make him the coach or the GM. Any good teammate is going to stick up for his boys and try to push them to get great deals and great contracts, of course! Any person would stick up for those that they like and go against those they don't like. It's up to the GM to draw the line in the sand when it comes to staffing decisions and contracts, and if that means getting in the face of Lebron James, so be it. When Gilbert supposedly says Lebron leaving would get him his team back, that's not a negative mark on Lebron- that's a negative mark on Dan Gilbert. If Lebron leaves next season and Lue starts drawing up plays and forcing the team to follow that, that's not a negative mark on Lebron, that's a negative mark on Lue for not being able to reel in his players. Phil Jackson did it with MJ and Kobe, and those guys had just as big if not bigger and more aggressive personalities than Lebron.

tl;dr: LeGM and LeCoach jokes are funny, but it's the real GM and real coach's fault if they can't stand up to one of their players, regardless of how good he is. The player shouldn't be getting the blame because the GM or coach doesn't know how to stand their ground.",0.49,controversial,6/29/18 20:34
221,Two overlooked things in the Lebron vs Jordan debate,1,7z6ubc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7z6ubc/two_overlooked_things_in_the_lebron_vs_jordan/,189,1519259578,"Tl;dr The fact that Jordan got to team up with an all time great in Scottie isn't considered enough when talking about his Championships, and Jordan didn't have to get through Duncan/Pop and this Warriors dynasty to win his. 

The Ringer is doing ""Jordan Lebron Week"" right now, and I've been reading/listening to all their coverage because as a 26 year old who just missed out on watching Jordan, its something I'm really interested in. In all their coverage however, there are two pro-Lebron points that I feel are missing that I wanted to talk about here and see what you all think.

1st: Scottie Pippen. 
Jordan played with Pippen for 9 years, and Pippen was an elite player for 7 of those. (I'm not counting his first two seasons in the league.) What I think people aren't realizing is just how elite Pippen was. Pippen made the NBA's official ""Top 50 players of all time"" list in 1996, and Bill Simmons ranked him number 24 in 2010. The only players of the same era that Simmons had ranked above Pippen were Barkley, Malone, Olajuwon, and Jordan. In the 93-94 season that Jordan didn't play, Pippen finished 3rd in MVP voting. In other words, its fair to say that Jordan played the majority of his Bulls' career, and won all of his Championships, with another top 5 player in the NBA on his team. Top 10 at worst. 

In Lebron's career, prime Dwyane Wade is the only player he has played with that you could make any argument is a top 5 player in the NBA. Worth noting, Lebron did not team up with Wade until Wade's age 29 season, and by the time Lebron's tenure in Miami ended, Wade was clearly past his prime, which anyone who watched the second Finals against San Antonio can attest to. In other words, Lebron only played with a player near Scottie Pippen's caliber for about 3 years. In those 3 years, he won 2 Championships and lost in the Finals. Can you imagine if Lebron and Wade had teamed up for 7 years of Wade's prime? In other words, if Lebron had been on Miami for the 4 years before he actually joined? Are we sure he wouldn't have 3 or 4 more Championships? I think its quite possible. Lebron was dragging Boobie Gibson to the Finals in that stretch, and Wade was winning a Championship with Shaq. 

2nd point: Who played better teams in the Finals? 
Jordan's Finals were against a 58-24 Lakers team that was 32 year old Magic and not much else, a 57-25 Trail Blazers team that was Clyde Drexler and not much else, a 62-10 Barkley led Suns team, a 64-18 Supersonics team, a 64-18 Jazz team, and a 62-20 Jazz team. 

Lebron has played a 58-24 Duncan/Ginobili/Parker Spurs team, a 57-25 Dirk Mavericks team, a 47-19 young OKC team, 58-24 Spurs team with Duncan and young Kawhi, a 62-10 Spurs team, a 67-15 Warriors team, a 73-9 Warriors team, and a 67-15 Warriors team. 

If you rank the opponents they played, the worst were probably the Mavericks and Thunder that Lebron played. The best were definitely the 3 Warriors teams Lebron played. In the middle, personally, I would put the Duncan led Spurs ahead of anyone Jordan played. Their records are a few games worse than the best teams Jordan played, but Pop always rested guys in the regular season. Duncan is one of the 10 greatest players ever, which none of Jordan's opponents can claim, and Parker/Ginobili/Kawhi and the rest of the supporting cast is very very good. Not to mention Popovich. Its arguable that the 6 Finals Lebron played vs the Spurs and Warriors featured tougher competition than any of the 6 Finals Jordan played in. It is inarguable to me that Lebron's Championship against the 73 win Warriors team, which he did without a Pippen/Wade level player (no offense Kyrie) is the most impressive Championship of them all. (He led every player on both teams in scoring/rebounds/assists/blocks and steals. Insane.) Its arguable that his Championship with Miami against San Antonio is the second most impressive Championship of them all. 

All of this is to say, comparing these two players is really hard. However, pointing to ""Jordan won 6 Championships and never lost in the Finals"" as the end all be all, is stupid. If Lebron had prime Scottie Pippen for every Finals he played in, and he got to play Stockton and Malone instead of Curry/Durant (and the rest of that stupidly loaded team) Lebron may have already surpassed 6 Championships. And he has who knows how many years left? 

Thoughts? 

P.S. If anyone from the Ringer sees this, tell Kevin O'Connor that when a podcast is billed as ""Jordan vs. Lebron"" and Chris Vernon makes an adamant case for Jordan, your role is to make the case for Lebron! Not say ""I didn't watch Jordan so I don't really know man."" Very deflating and not much of a ""Jordan vs Lebron"" debate. Love you though KOC

This first is Tristan Thompson. This is the possession right before he tried to elbow Livingston in the face. 

[Play 1](https://streamable.com/0qq4a)

He attempts to elbow Steph, but has to pull back to avoid colliding with Lebron.  Seems Tristan went for elbows multiple times on back to back possessions but missed both attempts. 

The next play I wanted bring up is the foul call on Klay Thompson with 4.7 left. 

[Play 2](https://streamable.com/s00ve)

On the replay you can see Hill hook Klay's arm, pull it down, then flop to the ground.  This foul call awards Hill two free throws with a chance to tie, and win the game for Cleveland. We all know he missed the second free throw and the JR debacle unfolds. If the refs were pro Golden State, why did they give Hill two free throws to win the game on a flop?

I saw a lot of comments that Tristan should not have been ejected on the Livingston play, and that the officials were one sided in this game. I feel these are two overlooked factors which contradict both statements.",0.51,controversial,6/1/18 19:25
225,(OC)Why is everyone MASSIVELY underrating the Portland TrailBlazers?,0,bocv0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bocv0k/ocwhy_is_everyone_massively_underrating_the/,158,1557829261,"In the past 24 hours, i havent seen a team more disrespected than how the Portland Trailblazers have been. It seems like most people on this sub is writing them of and predicting a 5 or 4 game domination by the Warriors. Heres a couple factors that people have been overlooking.

1. **The Warriors are without Kevin Durant** \- KD suffered a calf strain in late game 5 against the Rockets he is out for atleast game 1 and a really high chance he could miss game 2. With KD I agree that the Warriors should be the favorites, but without much info on his injury, its going to be difficult to guess when hes coming back.
2. **Portland is the deeper team** \- So far in these playoffs the Blazers have gotten more quality minutes from their non all star caliber guards than the Warriors have. Their bench has been more than capable of holding their lead throughout these playoffs. Contributions from Rodney Hood, Seth Curry and Zach Collins off the bench have been a big factor to their post season success. I dont see the Warriors getting the same type of contributions from their bench guys. Livingston has declined a lot and its hard to imagine Jerebko going off. 
3. **A much less talented team pushed them to 6 games WITH KD** \- Yes, i know playoffs are about matchups, but there is a large ~~marginal~~  talent gap between the Blazers and Clippers. The Clippers were able to push GS to a game 6 and managed to beat them twice in their home floor. So far the Blazers have 3 road wins these playoffs two of which were against the team with the biggest homecourt advantage and highest win % at home during the regular season (Nuggets). 
4. **Guard Battle** \- Yes the Warriors have the best back court in the league, it just so happens that the Blazers have the second best back court. If there are two other guards capable of going toe to toe with the Splash Bros in scoring it is CJ and Dame Dolla. You could honestly argue that the guards from Portland have had a better post season. Klay has been super streaky on offense, but his defense has been there every game. If the Warriors try to hide Steph and not let him guard Lillard, he will most likely get posted up by Mo Harkless or Aminu just like how they did agaisnt Jamal Murray.
5. **The Blazers are playing with a big chip on their shoulders** \- There isnt another team in the playoffs that is playing with the ""coming at you"" attitude that the Blazers are playing with. 

* Damian Lillard. A player who was been overlooked most of his career until mainly last season, but then ridiculed again for his inability to secure a win against the Pelicans last playoffs. His first round seemed like a coming out party, and his lackluster second round could mean hes in for a big series. 
   * CJ McCullum. A player who has all star level talent, but has not really received much accolades in his career other than a Most Improved Player award a few years ago due to the overpopulation of elite guards in the western conference. CJ was the first player ever drafted from Lehigh University and has earned himself a spot in this league do to his yoyo-like handle and his money mid range shot.
   * Enes Kanter. A player who was named ""UNPLAYABLE"" by an ex coach and was bought out by his previous team. This post season the man has proved that he deserves play time and hes BALLIN. Hes putting up a cool 13pts, 10.5rbs with 51% FG with an eye popping 3.7 Offensive rebounds WITH A SEPARATED SHOULDER and has gone through Ramadan for the past four games.
   * Seth Curry. A player who has been living under his brothers enormous shadow. The kid has contributed some solid minutes this post season and hes looking forward to proving himself against his sibling this series.
   * Rodney Hood. A player who was thought to be out of the league because of his lack of contribution to the Cavs playoff run last year. He has been Portlands best player off the bench all playoffs and has earned the trust of the team by playing quality and important minutes this post season.

**X Factor- Kevin Durant.** Its crazy to think that a team in the western conference finals has a chance of getting back the possible best player in the world and an elite big man. If KD misses more than two games i personally feel like this is Portlands series to lose. A reason as to why i feel like Boogie wont be as big of an impact is him not being 100% healed from his tear. Also Iguodala, the dude has a knack for making game winning plays when it matters the most.

**My Prediction: Blazers in 7.** Was originally going to say 6, but the repeating champs deserve the benefit of the doubt. 

Some of you might just skip this whole post and go straight to the comments claiming im just hating on the Golden State or i dont know what im talking about, but this is my opinion.

The Cavs locker room is a nightmare right now and their cap situation is a disaster. Nobody in their right mind would resign, especially if they get bounced before the finals. 
2. He's said the two most important things to him are winning and becoming a billionaire. 
3. Lebron-Harden-CP3-Capella is a better Big 4 than the Warriors his best/only shot at beating a healthy GSW next year. 
4. Texas has no state income tax, which would save Lebron millions of dollars annually, especially since Trumps new tax plan punishes those in high tax states. 
5. Houston has the assets/cap space to get him in a CP3 style opt in and trade. RyNo + Tucker and 3 future firsts works perfectly with the cap and for both teams 
6. He'd only committed for one year. If he really, really wants to be in LA he'll be a free agent the following summer and can go there then. But why not win a title first? Lonzo and Ingram will still be there in 2019. 
7. He could finally play with CP3. 
8. Did I mention they'd be unstoppable? The Big 4 + Ariza is a better starting lineup than GSW , and Gordon is better than anybody the Warriors bring off their bench. Bring back Mbah a Moute, NeNe, and some of Lebron's friends on vet mins and they've got the depth.

LeBron is leaving Cleveland. Who wouldn't? And the Rockets are his only realistic destination. Nobody else can offer him the money and chance to win Houston can. We'll see in July!",0.51,controversial,1/24/18 12:18
229,I'm sick of the Wilt Chamberlain misconceptions!,15,27l7qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/27l7qw/im_sick_of_the_wilt_chamberlain_misconceptions/,130,1402219958,"It seems like every thread when Wilt Chamberlain is brought up there are bunch of up-votes to comments which espouse the beliefs of Bill Simmons. Bill Simmons is not the ultimate authority on basketball. Bill Simmons also was not around to watch Russell or Chamberlain play. Bill simmons isn't an unbiased subjective observer who should be cited as support in a debate.     

Misconception #1     
""Wilt only dominated because of his size and era""    


Instead of analyzing the size of that era to modern times, I will instead use some other comparisons. Babe Ruth is considered by most baseball journalists to be the greatest baseball player ever. He played from 1918 to 1935 or nearly a century ago. He NEVER played a against  African Americans or latinos. He played against vastly inferior competition and yet his stats are held in high regard and no one questions his ability. I compare him to Chamberlain because they both produced stats that were exponentially higher than the competion. Ruth's numbers were so ridiculous that they have only been approached by Players who were said to be using performance enhancing drugs (Bonds). Yet no one questions the legitimacy of those numbers.    

When people think of wilt chamberlain they imagine some 60s version of shaq who just dunked on everyone. Wilt Chamberlain had a fully developed game. He had a jumpshot,  fadeaway, and shot fingerolls. He was an excellent passer as well as defender. This was in addition to his vastly superior athletic abilities. [Wilt Ultimate offensive force](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCWrGWuU2Ak)

**Misonception # 2**    
""Wilt didn't perform in the playoffs""

[Wilt Playoff Scoring](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/VDWwH   )    
    
For Wilts career he averaged 30.1 ppg in the regular season and 22.5ppg in the playoffs. Some have used this evidence of a drop off in performance during playoff time This just simply isn't true. Wilt chamberlains career has 2 distinct halves. For the first half of his career he was a scoring machine. After this he matured into a player who was a defensive anchor and offensive facilitator. This is evidenced by a DRAMATIC decrease in FG attempted per game as well as the fact that he was a league leader in assists. In his first 4 years in the playoffs he averaged 28.3 FG attempts per game and 34.6 ppg. His next 4 years in the playoffs he averaged 18.2 FG attempts per game and 24.9ppg. Then for the final 5 seasons of his playoff career he averaged 11.4 fg attmepts per game and 15.8 ppg. His playoff number are skewed because the majority of the games were played during his ""facilitator years"". He played  52 playoff games during his ""scoring machine era' where attempted a high number of Fgs per game, and he played 141 GAMES where during his ""facilitator era"" later in his career where he shot a SUBSTANIALLY less number of FGs per game.  
[Wilt Chamerlain Passing abilities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWHKZlQ9x7Q)    
Besides scoring he  posts pretty much the same number in rebounds and other major statistics.    
    
**Misconception #3**    
""Bill Russell shut Wilt down and was better than Wilt as evidenced by his 11 championship rings""    
First of all PLAYERS DO NOT WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS, TEAMS DO. Lebron beasted in cleveland but couldn't win until he went to miami. Kevin garnett beasted in Mn but did not win until he to the celtics. Jordan beasted in the 80s but didn't succeed until pippen developed into a top 10 player. Russell had a vastly superior team throughout his career. According to win share Russells teamates were worth 11 more wins per season :[Russell teamates](http://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/?p=4229). Russell had the benefit of playing for Red auerbach who is a top 3 greatest coach of all time while Wilt had a revolving door of coaches in his career. Russell also had the benefit of only being responsible for playing defense, While Wilt's teams relied on him for OFFENSE and DEFENSE.    
    
**Assorted Misconceptions**    
""Wilt wasn't respected among his peers who thought he was a poor teammate and competitor""    
[HOF Rick Barry on Wilt Chamberlain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSTt_TxoFVo)

**1) Klay Thompson:** My 3rd choice in the regular season, but his post-season performances just stamped it all for me. Greatest shooter in the game today bar his partner in crime. Takes over games. 2-way beast.

**2) James Harden:** Hate him for his defense, but easily the best shot creator at his position today. Draws fouls easy. Deceptively crazy handles because of his size. Strong as a bull and has wide shoulders to create separation. Can playmake and is a triple-double threat when given the opportunity to run the point.

**3) Jimmy Butler:** Top of my list pre-injury. Didn't come back strong, but a great 2-way player. Is to slashing the way Klay is to shooting. Can run the point too. Egoistic. Better as a 2nd option if on a contender than a 1st.

**4) Dwyane Wade:** Still Top 5 today at 34 being the All-Time great he is. Further proving his solid fundamentals that he relies on more as he ages. Mid-range. 2-way. Clutch as always.

**5) DeMar DeRozan:** Was a toss up between Wade and him in the reg season, but I'm settling for him at 5 because of the contrast in clutch v choke. Elite slasher and mid-range, but a hole on defense. Athleticism on point.

**6) CJ McCollum:** Really came into his own last season. Craziest part about his rise is how unfazed he is and always seems so calm and collected as if he's already a star for years. Stable stroke and reliable in crunch time. Is some sort of a combo guard like how Brandon Roy was for the same team.

**7) J.J. Redick:** Klay-lite or elder-Klay. Is essentially Klay Thompson limited to just running off screens for catch and shoot 3s. Solid defensively. Is the ultimate complimentary piece to the 'Big 3' in LA. Does his role almost to perfection. Very smart at finding angles for separation and a sweet stroke to boot. Crazy efficient at 16 PPG on 48% 3PT FG.

**8) Khris Middleton:** Possibly the most underrated on this list. Low-key the most consistently good player on the underwhelming Bucks (won't say he's the best because of Giannis' out-of-nowhere explosion by season end). 3&D wing. Gives you 20 points if you need him to. Has the size advantage at 6 foot 8.

**9) J.R. Smith:** Big-time in the Finals. Known to be a rapid-fire 3-point chucker, but when tamed in an environment with stars around him, came into his own as a 'pick your poison' weapon. Sweet shooting stroke allows him to get a solid shot off off-balanced when his team needs it. Turns up his defense when called upon. Willing sacrifice of his ego en route to a long-awaited ring.

**10) Avery Bradley:** All-Defense level defense. Hounds the on-ball player like no other. Improved his 3-point shooting to become a respectable 3&D threat. Absence in the playoffs obviously cost Boston a well-matched series. Still, an undersized player at SG.

**Honorable mentions:**

**Brandon Knight & Victor Oladipo:** One played at an All-Star level pre-early-injury and the other may finally break out in the OKC-Harden role on a contender.

231,Why is it a prevalent opinion that Fultz will rediscover his jump shot in the off-season when he's worked on his jumper behind closed doors for 5 months and has shown marginal improvement at best?,0,8e67xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8e67xl/why_is_it_a_prevalent_opinion_that_fultz_will/,142,1524460020,"Here's Sixers' beat writer Kyle Neubeck answering a question on whether Fultz will improve his jump shot over the offseason: 

>I’m really not trying to be alarmist about Fultz’s future, but I don’t think the complete absence of his jumpshot is lending the most hope toward the reclamation of his shot.

>As I reported in February, the public timeline and the private timeline for what Fultz was doing this season are wildly different. This is not a player who was shut down and not working for an extended period of time — Fultz was in the gym working and shooting all throughout the season, including during the tumultuous months of October and November.

> Knowing that’s the case, the case for him rediscovering his jumper in the offseason becomes flimsier. It’s one thing to minimize expectations for skill development within a season because it’s hard to ask players to keep piling on new moves and traits when you’re trying to build a base of consistency. But Fultz is not having a normal season, and was allowed to essentially go through a skill development program without any of the day-to-day demands of playing in games.

> Is that much different from what he's going to be exposed to this offseason? I'm not sure. You can make a case that coaches and trainers he might work with would have unlimited time together in the offseason, free from the burden of helping with game prep and development of other players. They can get back to basics with Fultz without limitations. He's a hard worker and a good kid, and those facts still bode well.

> Theoretically, yes, a full offseason will help him more than anything he was able to do during the season. There's a low likelihood he'll play in Summer League, as I'd imagine the team will be happy to have him working out behind closed doors and just getting thousands of reps in as a jump-shooter.

> But as with anything Fultz-related, there's too much guesswork to say for sure. I don't know if or when the ""old form"" is coming back, and I would be skeptical about anyone who postures as such.

Moreover, Westbrook is leading a lower-caliber team (relative to the Warriors) to the longest win streak in the NBA, a claim Curry cannot attest to. 

Since the beginning of January, comparative statistics:
       
**Russell Westbrook:** 12G, 34.4MPG, 27.9/9.2/9.9 on .506/.407/.671        
**Stephen Curry:** 11G, 34.8MPG, 30.9/5.2/6.8 on .528/.480/.863             
_______________
Obviously, Curry has the offensive advantage, as evidenced by the disparity in PPG and 3PT%. However, Westbrook has spearheaded the remarkable Thunder turnaround. He's a significantly greater passing and assisting force- he doesn't have a player like Green to facilitate the offense- and does more work on rebounds as well. 

The obvious reason Westbrook should be receiving MVP consideration is his durability. Curry and Harden, whom most consider the frontrunning candidates, have missed significant time. This damaged their team. Westbrook has been the pinnacle of durability, playing in every Thunder game this season.

I'll start by saying this is a personal opinion and that it doesn't encompass the impression of the entire /r/NBA community on the matter. (Though you would see in the comments below if they agree or disagree.)

Straight to the point: I'm not sure whose idea is this, Adidas or NBA's but, uhm, this paraphernalia is as fatuous as excreta.

The Boston Celtics is a legendary championship franchise but seeing Evan Turner with the gold tab was just wrong. The Sacramento Kings have the tab for the championship they inherited from the Rochester Royals. And it's crazy to think that the Celtics, the team that has the most championships with 17, have the same gold tab as the Kings, a team that has one from the 50's. If my count is right, there are 17 current franchises that have won a chip. I guess I better get used to it.

Or not.

*Here's what I suggest:*

* **Have the gold tabs for the defending champions only.** I mean, it's fair, they deserve it, the champs deserve something.
* **Have the gold tabs for players who have a ring.** Of course, benchwarmers will have them but hey if you were part of that team, you deserve it. I don't mind seeing Joel Anthony with it while Carmelo Anthony doesn't vs. seeing Boozer with it while LeBron without.

The rookie who couldn't shoot a lick but attacked the rim fearlessly.  The guy who's been hitting big shots since his rookie year.  The guy who worked hard in the gym to actually develop a jumpshot.  He had a devastating injury and the Heat had a horrible year.  He backed it up with 30 pts 7.5 assist, 5 rebounds 2 steals and a block per game the next year, all from a 6'4 guard.  He held Miami down with absolutely no help after their first championship.  Then Lebron and Dwyane and Chris hookup.  They all had the same complaint, they never had enough help and avg 30 pts and not winning wasn't good enough for them.  Now everyone on r/NBA and even real life are complaining, ""wade holds Miami back"" ""Lebron would be so much better without Wade"" Frankly, they went to 2 finals in 2 years.  If either of them weren't on the team, they'd be the Cavs and Heat from 2010 (both teams couldn't get past the celtics)  Everyone knew both players numbers would dip, D Wade even said he'd take a step back so Lebron could get the numbers, but everyone acting like Dwyane doing the things that made him great is all of a sudden a bad thing.

Traded for Iman Shumpert and JR Smith and signed them to expensive extensions even though the former is an offensive black hole and the latter has been non existent in the playoffs save one Finals series. 

Traded two first round picks for one season of Timofey F-ing Mozgov

Signed Tristan Thompson to a max multi year extension even though he's an offensive black hole. 

Gave away a 2018 conditional first round pick so someone would take the corpse of Anderson Varejao and his god awful contact off their hands. 


Now they have no cap flexibility and a team that is two years too old because GM LeBron couldn't wait for younger players to develop and had to make sure his fellow Klutch Sports teammate got paid. His greatest competition is younger, and getting better every season, and now he's passive aggressively threatening to leave next season because he realized he put himself in a poor situation.

Lonzo Ball: His camp has already said he doesn't want to be there and I think Lavar Ball would be as dangerous as ever. Lavar Ball has had a reason to keep his mouth shut, doesn't want to mess up a good thing Lonzo has going by being on the Lakers with LeBron, can't imagine what Lavar would do when he has no incentive to stay quiet. 

Brandon Ingram: After next season Brandon Ingram is eligible for a max and if the Pelicans don't offer him a max, another team most certainly will based off of the fact Andrew Wiggins and Otto Porter got one. So the narrative goes from Brandon Ingram being a nice young controllable asset to probably being over paid and just, meh.

Kyle Kuzma: Not much to say here, he is a great asset and is probably the actually highlight of the trade.

The reported two first round picks: the first round picks would have been  in the 24-30 range, meh.

In conclusion, the Lakers offer was anything but a kings ransom. I think it was best for the Pelicans to wait until the off-season when they have a new front office to make the decision. It is VERY hard to imagine that the Lakers won't still be offering Brandon Ingram and company. Also I think everyone else knows that the Lakers have to move Brandon Ingram before he hits RFA because there is no way the Lakers are giving him a max and they can't let him leave for nothing like they did with Randle.",0.54,controversial,2/9/19 9:07

In the regular season, dude is 5th in BPM all-time (behind LeBron, MJ, Charles Barkley, and David Robinson) and 11th in VORP (just behind Larry Bird).

Lonzo being hurt has also been a big factor. He’s not the second best player on the team but he’s the second most important.

I haven't watched all of these guys and a lot of these judgments are based on stats alone, so please tell me if I got something wrong.

I put some guys here where it may be too early to call them a bust, so they could very well redeem their careers in the future. Conversely, it may be possible for some guys to make themselves seem more like busts over time.

#2018 NBA draft (1)

* No. 13: Jerome Robinson (barely played this year, stats not so good)

Draft is looking pretty stacked so far. Too early for anyone besides JRob to stick out as a potential bust, but of course, he can turn it around, it's only his first year.

#2017 NBA draft (2)

* No. 1: Markelle Fultz
* No. 8: Frank Ntilikina

Good lottery, things could change but so far only these two PGs stick out as busts. Fultz isn't bad, but relative to what you expect for a No. 1 pick, he kinda is. Frank is just bad, but he's young and can turn it around.

#2016 NBA draft (4)

* No. 4: Dragan Bender
* No. 8: Marquese Chriss (could turn it around, putting up good numbers after trade to Cavs)
* No. 10: Thon Maker
* No. 13: Georgios Papagiannis (not even in the league anymore...)

Weak draft, some solid players later in there but lottery isn't so hot. 

#2015 NBA draft (4)

* No. 5: Mario Hezonja
* No. 8: Stanley Johnson
* No. 9: Frank Kaminsky (if you're reading this, sorry)
* No. 14: Cameron Payne

Several solid rotation players in this draft. Jahlil Okafor would be here if I made the list a few months ago, but he's redeemed himself after his burst of really good play for New Orleans. If it's not sustainable, back here he'll go.

#2014 NBA draft (5)

* No. 1: Andrew Wiggins (wouldn't be considered a bust 2 years ago, but now, yeah)
* No. 2: Jabari Parker (injuries...)
* No. 5: Dante Exum
* No. 8: Nik Stauskas
* No. 9: Noah Vonleh

Stacked draft in terms of busts. Wiggins was looking good until he got his max contract. He promised to improve, but I don't think he can capitalize on that. Jabari ""They Don't Pay Me to Play Defense"" Parker is also looking more and more like a bust. Some solid players later in the draft.

#2013 NBA draft (5)

* No. 1: Anthony Bennett
* No. 4: Cody Zeller
* No. 5: Alex Len
* No. 7: Ben McLemore
* No. 14: Shabazz Muhammad

Pretty bad draft, with several high busts. Best player in the draft wasn't even a lottery selection.

#2012 NBA draft (3)

* No. 2: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
* No. 5: Thomas Robinson
* No. 13: Kendall Marshall

Decent draft. Not too many busts, and some stars.

#2011 NBA draft (4)

* No. 2: Derrick Williams
* No. 6: Jan Vesely
* No. 7: Bismack Biyombo
* No. 10: Jimmer Fredette

Deep draft, but weak at the top (except for Kyrie).

#2010 NBA draft (5)

* No. 2: Evan Turner
* No. 4: Wesley Johnson
* No. 6: Epke Udoh
* No. 11: Cole Aldrich
* No. 12: Xavier Henry

Pretty mediocre draft. Most of the talent is at the top, and the top still has a good amount of busts mixed in.

#2009 NBA draft (6)

* No. 2: Hasheem Thabeet
* No. 6: Jonny Flynn
* No. 8: Jordan Hill
* No. 11: Terrence Williams
* No. 13: Tyler Hansbrough
* No. 14: Earl Clark

Stacked both in terms of superstar talent (Blake, Harden, Curry, DeMar) but lots of busts. Some solid players later in the draft.

#Conclusion

Interesting to note that Charlotte drafted (or traded for, on draft night) 5 busts in a row (2011-2015).

250,Why dont people ever mention how much easier it was for Jordan to score because of old defensive rules?,0,6co7h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6co7h1/why_dont_people_ever_mention_how_much_easier_it/,38,1495498477,"If you want to compare Lebron and Jordan then compare the rules too.

There are two illegal defense rules. The old one prohibited zone defense. The new one limits the ability of a zone defender to remain in the paint guarding no one.

For decades the NBA required teams to play man-to-man defense, which meant everyone on the court had to guard someone. You could double team one player and then recover to your man, but you could not be caught between players, guarding no one. That would be an illegal defense. That also meant you couldn't just stand in the paint all day guarding no one.

To take advantage of this rule, lousy teams with one great player like Michael Jordan would put MJ on one side of the floor and everyone else on the other side. This was the isolation play, or iso, for short. It would turn into a game of one-on-one which MJ would win. (This is before Jordan found some worthy teammates and Phil Jackson incorporated them into the offense with the triangle.)

Various tweaks to the rules tried to limit isos, but never eliminated them. When zone defenses became legal, though, it made isos much harder. The two man game, the pick and roll or pick and pop, has become much more popular than isos, simply because the defense can easily flood the side of the floor where the iso is taking place, forcing the star player to go one on three or pass the ball.

The NBA tried to give something to iso players when it eliminate the old illegal defense rule and made the zone legal. In order to prevent rim protectors from standing in the paint all day, when the NBA eliminated one kind of illegal defense they created another, the 3 second rule. A defender cannot stand in the paint guarding no one for 3 seconds or longer. Every 2.9 seconds he has to step out of the paint. That's the modern illegal defense rule.

However, despite the new illegal defense rule, legalizing the zone defense led to Tim Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, popularized when Thibodeau was the assistant coach in charge of defense during the Celtics' championship season in 2007-08. The zone had been legal for a while, but Thibodeau figured out how to flood the strong side of the floor, the side with the ball, with an extra defender, often forcing a long cross-court pass that would allow time for the defense to recover. The object of the defense was to force the ball out of the best player's hands.

Thibodeau dealt with the new illegal defense rule by training Kevin Garnett (and later Joakim Noah) to remain in the paint for 2.9 seconds, step out, then step back in. As long as he steps out every 2.9 seconds, he could be in the paint all day, guarding no one.

Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, or variations thereof, have been widely adopted in the NBA. The iso has fallen out of favor. The two man game is very popular, but passing to the other side of the floor must remain an option if the two men on the strong side find themselves outnumbered. One of LeBron James' remarkable abilities, for example, is making bullet passes all the way across the floor with precision to a spot up shooter standing at the three point line, so that the defense doesn't have time to recover. This is a vital skill under present rules. 

In addition to this you couldnt double a player without the ball. It was much easier for Jordan to score with 90s rules than it would be with current ones.",0.49,controversial,5/22/17 17:14

255,[OC] Are Chris Paul and Big Sean the same person?,8,8q2b8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8q2b8t/oc_are_chris_paul_and_big_sean_the_same_person/,25,1528680334,"Hello /r/nba, I posted this before but now offseason is in full swing and this comparison still hasn't been compromised by the WCF. I have come to the startling realization that the NBA's very own Point God may possibly be the rapper Big Sean. In this post, I will prove to you that Big Sean and Chris Paul are the same people through three different categories: Physical Traits, Timeline and Legacy.

**Physical Traits**

Take a look: [Big Sean with a hat](https://i.imgur.com/tIHBExe.jpg) looks a lot like [Chris Paul with a hat](https://i.imgur.com/CUtcAPO.jpg). Similar facial hair, similar eyebrows, similar mouth, and both wearing hats. 

Furthermore, Chris Paul is an undersized point guard (""6'0"") with great court vision, smooth handles, and an underrated finishing ability. Big Sean, similarly, is an undersized rapper (5'8'') with a [great vision](https://youtu.be/D-OJud1suYA?t=1m27s), [smooth handles](https://i.imgur.com/rJ9oL41.jpg), and an [underrated finishing ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUVS0qhow7g). Those are not the most intriguing coincidental physical traits. 

Big Sean got his moniker because he has a self-proclaimed large dick (Google for a maybe photoshopped image). Chris Paul, likewise, [is a huge dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfKEBENB7tk).

If these physical similarities are not enough, consider this: both Big Sean and Chris Paul have never been seen together. Ever. Even though both lived in the same part of Los Angeles.

**Timeline**

If we take a look at both CP3 and Big Sean's timeline, we can see more similarities. First, let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, Chris Paul (33) is 3 years older than Big Sean (30), but you have to account for inflation and basketball age. Chris Paul is 6'0 officially. However, he is closer to 5'10 without basketball shoes, almost 3 inches less than his listed height. If he were to take off his basketball shoes, his age would scale accordingly and take 3 years off.

The most compelling evidence in their timelines is the release of the song [Bounce Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phr1pOFK1V8). In this song, Big Sean proclaims ""Last night I took an L but tonight I bounce back."" Released mid-2017, ever since the song gained traction that summer, Chris Paul has [never lost back-to-back games in Houston](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01/gamelog/2018/) when he played EXCEPT one time. The only time he lost 2 games in a row was in Detroit, or Big Sean's hometown. Every other game he played, he bounced back after taking the L.

Big Sean's album releases also coincide with events in Chris Paul's life. His first studio album, ""Finally Famous"", was released in 2011. This year was also when Chris Paul signed to the Clippers, where he moved to LA where people become famous. 

Big Sean's second album, ""Hall of Fame"", was released in 2013, around the time when people realized that CP3 had a likely chance to go in the Hall of Fame as one of the best point guards. This was around the time that CP3 got his first MVP award (All-Star Game) and led the Clippers to a franchise-high 56 wins at the time. Through this album, Sean released his hit single [Guap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ6y5nIW26E). Similarly, Paul signed a 5 year $107 million contract with the Clippers.

""Dark Sky Paradise"", Sean's third album released in 2013, parallel's Paul's discontention with the Clippers. With song names like All Your Fault, I Don't Fuck With You, Play No Games, Win Some, Lose Some, and Stay Down, Sean chronicles Chris Paul's failures to go past the second round in the NBA Playoffs.

CP3, after years of mediocrity in the playoffs, got fed up and signed with Houston to create a contending team. Fittingly, Big Sean released his album ""I Decided."" in 2017 around the time of the signing, clearly parallelling LeBron's The Decision but for Chris Paul. This album has the hit song [Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cIkC7s3d2o), of which Chris Paul has [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ler0hq_lYfM).

**Legacy**

Both Chris Paul and Big Sean are stars in the NBA and hip-hop communities, respectively. Chris Paul is widely regarded as one of the best point guards in the league currently, but has never been the consensus best. Big Sean is one of the top selling rappers in the game, but will never reach the level of Kanye, Kendrick, Jay-Z etc. Both men have name recognition but not a lot of facial recognition to casual consumers.

I deem both Chris Paul and Big Sean with the Modelo Legacy.

What is the Modelo Legacy, you ask?

Well, Modelo, as some know, is a beer. It's a decent beer. Most Americans have heard of it and many people have had it before. If someone asks you, ""All I got is a Modelo, you want it?"", most people would say sure. It is entirely socially acceptable to enjoy a nice Modelo, but if someone says that it is their favorite beer, something is wrong. No one should have Modelo as their favorite beer. They can enjoy one, but at the end of the day, Corona is a better AB InBev beer that tastes better.

Similarly, Big Sean is a good rapper. He makes hits. People play him at parties and enjoy his songs, singing along to his catchy hits. People understand him as a popular rapper and no one bats an eye if you say you like Big Sean. But once someone says that Big Sean is their FAVORITE rapper, you know something's wrong. There are many answers to the question, ""who is your favorite rapper,"" but Big Sean is not one. You can list any rapper (Biggie, Danny Brown, Elzhi, Ghostface, Future, Chance, Kendrick, Uzi Vert, Famous Dex, Yung Lean) and you can usually argue why you like them the best. There are no arguments why Big Sean is someone's favorite rapper. Hell, even the hometown treatment doesn't work because Eminem and Slaughterhouse is from Detroit.

In CP3's case, he is a great player. People call him the Point God because he is very good at what he does. He plays defense, he passes the ball, and he scores. Fans like Chris Paul. It's fine to do so. It's respectable. But at this moment, he shouldn't be anyone's favorite player. He's not the best point guard in the league anymore (or at any time shoutout to Deron Williams fans). He isn't even the best guard on his own team. Houston fans usually like Harden or Capela more. Pelicans fans like AD, Boogie, or Jrue. Clippers fans now like DJ, Lou, or Boban.

However, both Sean and Paul will have a legacy in the hip-hop and NBA communities. Big Sean is one of the best selling artists of the current generation and has headlined many festivals. He has had multiple albums reach number 1 in the Billboard charts and has multiple triple platinum songs. Chris Paul will still be remembered as one of the greatest point guards ever in the NBA. He is a 9-time All-Star, 7-time All-NBA, and 9-time All-Defense player destined to enter the Hall of Fame.

**Conclusion**

So what do you think? Are Chris Paul and Big Sean the same person?

TL;DR: Paul and Sean big same.",0.53,controversial,6/10/18 18:25
256,[OC] Joel Embiid is (not) a Turnover Machine,0,858nz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/858nz3/oc_joel_embiid_is_not_a_turnover_machine/,34,1521369829,"I've seen a bunch of posts on this subreddit talking about Embiid and one of the biggest criticisms of his game: turnovers. The general narrative seems to be that Embiid is a young player who turns the ball over a lot, and is therefore one of the driving forces behind the 76ers leading the league in turnovers.  

I'd like to argue the opposite. **I believe Embiid helps the 76ers prevent turnovers more than any other player on the team** and I'll try to show why.  

First, let's take a look at the best and worst teams in the league with turnovers (full data [here](https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/?sort=TOV&dir=-1)):

|Rank|Team|Turnovers Per Game|
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|1|Mavericks|12.4
|2|Timberwolves|12.4
|...|...|...
|28|Warriors|15.7
|29|Lakers|15.9
|30|76ers|17.0
The 76ers are the worst team in the league at taking care of the ball. There are a number of reasons why this might be, ranging from inexperience to starting a rookie point guard with shooting struggles, but I'd argue the single biggest reason is their *style of play*. They play an offensive system with a fast pace, lots of ball movement, and lots of player movement. [This recent Nylon Calculus piece by Ian Levy](https://fansided.com/2018/03/07/nylon-calculus-offensive-style-changes-2017-18-season/) does a great job visualizing these offensive styles in a clear way, and when we look at teams like the [Mavericks](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Mavs.jpg) and [Timberwolves](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Timberwolves.jpg) (who rarely turn it over) versus the [Warriors](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Warriors.jpg) and [76ers](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/76ers.jpg) (who turn it over a ton), it's easy to see the difference. I'm not going to argue that one style of offense is inherently better than another, but I think it's reasonable to say the Warriors/76ers style causes more turnovers at a team level than a slow offense with fewer moving parts.

---
Now let's imagine dropping a player into this high-turnover system. How would you measure whether they were turnover prone themselves as opposed to being a victim of the system?  
I'd propose looking at how much the 76ers turn it over when that player is on the floor versus when they are off. To do this, we'll use team turnover percent (TOV%) instead of turnovers per game, and among those with at least 100 minutes played this season, here is the data (full data [here](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612755/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1)):  

|Player|Minutes Played|76ers TOV% On Court (Rank)|76ers TOV% Off Court (Rank)
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|Ilyasova|198|14.3% (1/14)|14.1% (1/14)
|Embiid|1782|15.7% (2/14)|17.9% (14/14)
|Luwawu-Cabarrot|807|16.2% (3/14)|16.9% (12/14)
|Anderson|387|16.3% (4/14)|16.8% (9/14)
|Belinelli|362|16.3% (5/14)|15.3% (2/14)
|Redick|1776|16.5% (6/14)|17.0% (13/14)
|Covington|2119|16.5% (7/14)|16.9% (11/14)
|Saric|2046|16.6% (8/14)|16.8% (10/14)
|Booker|494|16.7% (9/14)|16.5% (6/14)
|Simmons|2316|16.8% (10/14)|16.5% (7/14)
|Holmes|522|17.3% (11/14)|16.6% (8/14)
|McConnell|1491|17.4% (12/14)|16.2% (4/14)
|Bayless|925|17.4% (13/14)|16.4% (5/14)
|Johnson|927|18.5% (14/14)|16.0% (3/14)
|Overall|3284|16.7%|16.7%
Embiid's numbers stand out. Other than Ilyasova, who recently joined the team during a time when turnovers have been down overall, the team turns it over the least when Embiid is on the floor and the most when he is off. This is not at all what we would expect if Embiid was the reason behind the turnovers. It actually looks much more like a stabilizing player inserted into a turnover-prone system.  
There is an alternative hypothesis why Embiid's on/off are so staggering. Maybe his backup is the real issue, dragging everyone else's TOV% up except for Embiid's. This is (rightly) a common critique of on/off data, and while this might seem plausible looking at Amir Johnson's numbers, it seems doubtful. Johnson is actually having a [career low](https://stats.nba.com/player/101161/?sort=PCT_TOV&dir=-1) in the % of his team's turnovers attributed to him, and his on/off data using team TOV% [with](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) [Boston](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) and [with](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) [Toronto](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2013-14&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) placed him either among his team's best or middle of the pack. Johnson simply looks bad because he never gets to benefit from sharing the floor with Embiid, unlike Richaun Holmes, the other backup center who often sees minutes at power forward alongside Joel.

---
**TL;DR**: Of course Embiid makes bad decisions with the ball, forces passes at times, and could do a better job handling double teams. Anyone who watches the 76ers can see it, and it can even drive his fans nuts. But for those who argue that he's the reason why the 76ers lead the league in turnovers, I'd say he's the only reason they're not even worse.",0.49,controversial,3/18/18 3:43

I realized recently that it's actually Kareem who has the best claim to GOAT from anyone else.  He dominated the entire decade of the 1970s, then was a top tier Center for the entire 80s.  Elite player for an entire two decades.

**Kareem:  6 MVPs, 15 All NBA Selections, 11 All Defensive Teams, 6 Rings, Career PER 24.5**

**MJ: 5 MVPs,  11 All NBA Selections, 9 All Defensive Teams, DPOY, 6 Rings, Career PER 27.9**

**Bron: 4 MVPs, 15 All NBA Selections, 6 All Defensive Teams, 3 Rings, Career PER 27.1**

Kareem had more MVPs, more defensive teams, longer prime and extended his career as a supplementary star in the late 80s.  The only reason his PER took a major tank is because of the sheer longevity of his career- his 13-year prime's PER average is around 27 as well.  

Kareem has the longevity, has scored the most ever, has the most MVPs indicative of prime (if you look at individual years, he should've had a total of 10 MVPs (the entirety of the 1970s except for 1975), while Jordan should've had 9 MVPs (1988-1993, 1996-1998), and Bron should've had 8 MVPs (2008-2013, 2017-2018)).

260,My case for Lebron James deserving his 5th MVP,2,5uo17e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5uo17e/my_case_for_lebron_james_deserving_his_5th_mvp/,65,1487387712,"First of all, I'm a Lebron die hard fan. He is why I started watching basketball back in 2006 and he's why I'm ferociously obsessed with it today. So, if my bias is sticking way out, I apologize. But here's my case for Lebron deserving the MVP this season. 

As of today,
Harden on-court: +7.6
Harden off: +4.6
Westbrook on-court:+3.2
Westbrook off: -10.5
Lebron on-court: +9.1
Lebron off: -4.2
So, what does that mean? It means that Hardens team does well without him and I attribute that to the crazy tempo and system the Rockets play in. Westbrooks total net rating here is +13.7 where Lebrons is +13.3, so Westbrook is having a greater positive impact on his team overall by 2/5 of a point over Lebron. A marginal difference which I'm going to call a tie. 
Lebron/Westbrook: 1
Harden: 0

Harden and Westbrook have had healthy teams all year. I know they both have rosters with less talent than Cleveland, but that can't be ignored. Lebrons been down a starting guard for months and will continue to be, as well as being down another starting all star forward for the rest of the regular season almost. Hes doing more with less in my opinion because of the uncertainty from game to game. This whole section is my bias sticking way out but hey, whatever. 
Lebron:2
Brodie:1
Beard:0

Hardens team is a top 4 seed in the west, but they've been struggling recently. Brodies team is the 7 seed I believe, but they're just not a very good team in general. Lebrons team is the 1 seed in the east and are 7-1 in their last 8. 1 seed > 4-7 seeds. Therefore,
Lebron:3
Brodie:1
Beard:0

All 3 guys are averaging career highs in assists, so that's a wash. Harden is leading the league in assists though, so he gets the point here. 
Brodie is averaging a triple double. holy fuck. he gets a point too. Lebrons shooting 39% from 3 this year, his second highest ever, and a higher number than KD can claim. For Lebron, that's a storyline in itself. No point for that, but it's noteworthy considering that was a worry going into the playoffs last year. 
Lebron:3
Brodie:2
Beard:1

Now it's about the narrative. Brodie has the KD departure/revenge tour on his side along with the triple doubles. But, he's a turnover machine (not entirely his fault, but still) and he's super inefficient offensively and average defensively. And, his team isn't going to finish top 4. How far will the narrative carry him? I don't know. 
Beard is on a fun and dope team to watch, they let 3s fly, and don't play defense at all. He's still a bad defensive player, but he has the astronomical numbers and change to point guard thing going for him. How far will his numbers go to persuade people? I don't know. 
Lebrons interesting. He has the ""here's your reward for what you did last June"" thing in his favor, he has an injury depleted team for the remainder of the season which will only spotlight his play even more, and he's having his best season ever if you exclude his 4 MVP years. He's the universally accepted best player in the world, leading his team to the 1 seed in his conference, averaging 26, 9, and 8 on 54% from the field and 39% from 3. I give this one to Lebron. 
Bron:4
Brodie:2
Beard:1 
Also, I didn't include Kawhi because he hasn't been getting the buzz at all so I just assumed it would be kinda impossible for him to jump all the way into the conversation and I didn't include KD or Steph because they cancel each other out, in my opinion. 

Anyway, there's my biased take on why Lebron deserves the MVP. If I missed anything narratively for these guys or if I'm forgetting an important stat or something, let me know. I'll update this thing if I need to.",0.51,controversial,2/17/17 19:15

The thing is though compared to Giannis, Kawhi, Steph, LeBron, Jokic even, he doesn't make his team better. 

All of those guys create shots for themselves or create shots for their teammates. 

The man hasn't won a MVP, DPOY, not has been in actual consideration for those awards he's not even top 20 in both offensive & defensive per 48min win shares.

If you go for total win shares he's 13th behind Capela, Gobert, & Vuecic 

Hell the man quit on his team to take a easy way out, he doesn't even want to play the 5 because he doesn't want to get too injured, yet if you want to win you do whatever it takes.

Imo he's overrated, Giannis who came into the league a year later has the same amount of all nba selections, was in consideration for DPOY, & already won a MVP in less time than AD.

I don't buy the shitty roster statement that AD has been excused with, Jrue is a all-star caliber guy, Boogie before he went down is a top 10 center, Rondo while old played well for the Pelicans, yes Moore & Crawford weren't all that great but Giannis had to work with Joel Bolmboy, John Henson, DeAndre Liggins. 

Yes he had Parker & Brogdon but AD did have Holiday & Cousins, it's not like **the Pelicans didn't try to give him talent** hell **Alvin Gentry is a DAMN better coach than both Jason Kidd & Joe Prunty**

Like if you keep on saying ""so & so's roster was garbage"" you might as well excuse Karl Anthony Towns if he underachieves this year & leaves, or Devin Booker, guys who have so much talent, are considered top talents but everyone is saying they'll leave sooner than later because their organizations apparently missed the mark. Fact is that the teams can only do so much, the Wolves got **Jimmy Butler** which is a good move that didn't work out LIKE the Boogie trade. 

The Sun's just got Ayton who is a **BEAST** & now have a possible good PG in Jalen Lecque while getting Rubio in the meantime to help his development/start for them.

**TL;DR:**  Truly top 5 players elevate their teams & you can only blame a roster for so long, especially when there's evidence that the organization has tried to bring in talent to help their star + lack of consideration of alocades, it comes down to that specific player not having that talent to elevate their teams like Kawhi, LeBron, KD, Harden, Curry, Giannis & even Jokic. That's why I think AD is not as good as people make him sound like.**",0.57,controversial,8/17/19 20:48

I am making this post because I care as much about LGBT issues as the NBA. 

Also, don’t take this as an attack on why you enjoy the NBA or that enjoying certain characteristics of players makes you a bad person. I am simply using LGBT activism as a lens to be critical of the culture surrounding the NBA. 

My post uses incidents of homophobia in and around the NBA and the response to make an argument rather than data. I would also like to admit my argument here isn’t irrefutable and there are likely holes in my reasoning. 

With that said, let’s talk about Dwight. 

Now, immediately I want to separate jokes made about the allegations and actual homophobia. I’m talking about people calling Dwight a f*g or that he’s traded frequently because he’s a predator in the locker room. I know what you’re thinking: “That’s just how some toxic fans think and not representative of everyone” and I agree, to an extent. In the late 1960s the Celtics asked the city what could improve attendance. A lot (don’t know the exact percent, citation needed) of responses were “get rid of the black players”. Although those Celtics fans were only some of the fans of the NBA I think it accurately shows how a fanbase can be problematic without it necessarily being the majority.

With that said here’s my question: Why is there a homophobic culture in the NBA when social
activism is a big aspect of the league. 

Well, my response requires a suspension of disbelief in the sense that I don’t have concrete metrics on how to measure bigotry and what causes it. In order to answer the question, I need to define who is a fan of the NBA. 

Well, fans of basketball, who presumably played / are playing organized basketball.
 (I know this is obvious but it’s going somewhere). Since these fans wanted / want to be like their idols, there must be qualities of NBA players that they emulate. I propose the most revered aspect of an NBA player is their background, more specifically if they went from “Rags to Riches”. People like this quality because they think it’ll make them a better player because of the characteristics we attach to these players. That they work harder than the rest, that they deserve respect for making it out of their challenging situation, etc. However, I believe that another aspect of these players that fans idolize is their masculinity, as “a man does what it take to succeed in life”. 

Hopefully it’s clear where I’m going with this now. That the reason NBA fans are generally contradictory in their beliefs about social activism is because being gay isn’t seen as a masculine. 

(I don’t believe this is true but hopefully my argument makes sense now). 

NBA fans respect players because their masculinity allows them to work harder than the rest and become one of the best basketball players in the world. Therefore, (some) NBA fans don’t respect non masculine players / players they don’t think are masculine. For example, Dwight Howard being seen as gay, and in turn disrespected. 

I think this mentality isn’t exclusive to fans but also players.

 For instance, Jokic’s “No Homo” comment which, although it wasn’t homophobic, demonstrates a disdain for what’s perceived as non masculine. If that example doesn’t convince you, maybe Tim Hardaway Sr. stating he hates gay people in regards to former NBA player John Amaechi coming out as gay. 

Summary: 
Now, I’m not saying it’s impossible to go from rags to riches and not hate gays. I’m also not saying all NBA players go from rags to riches or that all NBA players believe masculinity causes greatness. I’m simply making an argument on why homophobia exists in the NBA (and I guess also in other sports) when it seems hypocritical.

Tl;dr - players and fans think masculinity is vital to being a good player which leads them to have homophobic ideas",0.47,controversial,2/26/19 0:59

Ingram just scores 4 points more per game because he's way more efficient. 60% TS% for Ingram vs 52.5% for Tatum. That's actually harder to do when you're the offense's primary option as opposed to the defense having to focus on Kemba, Brown, Hayward, etc. as well.

The Rockets don't really have a plan B. Live and die by the 3 and even though Harden has somehow gotten even better, he's still clearly susceptible to shooting meltdowns in playoff games. I've been super impressed with Daniel House but Houston's D just doesn't seem the same. 

The Bucks on the other hand are terrifying. They've been shooting superbly, Giannis with 58% (?) TS was the lowest of any of their starters in the first round. They can play through Giannis but at the same time have some excellent shooters. D looks solid and there's a swagger about the team, all while Malcolm Brogdon who's arguably their 4th/5th best player is missing.

The latest narrative is how the strong and stoic Kawhi (who doesn't give a fuck what anyone thinks) wisely chose not to play.

Near the end of the podcast, Amin went off about how much better Golden St.'s defensive is compared to either team the Cavs have faced so far in the Eastern Conference Playoffs (Detroit or Atlanta). He pointed out that points allowed per game isn't a good measure of how good/bad a team's defense is (TRUE) and that things like points allowed per 100 possessions is a better/more accurate measure of a team's defensive prowess (also TRUE). Using that (sound) logic, however, he went on to imply that the Warriors defense this season has been significantly better than anything the Cavs have seen thus far in the Playoffs. But is that true?

* Defensive Rating (DRtg) for teams is points allowed per 100 possessions. The Warriors allowed 103.8 points per 100 possessions, good for #6 in the NBA; the Hawks, by comparison, allowed 101.4 points per 100 possessions, good for #2 in the NBA (second only to the Spurs historic defense).
* Another helpful team defensive metric is opponents Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), which adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal. Golden St.'s eFG% allowed was 47.9%, good for #2; the Hawks' eFG% allowed was 48%, tied for #3.
* Defensive Rebounding Percentage (DRB%) is also a helpful defensive metric because it estimates the percentage of available defensive rebounds a team grabs. The Warriors grabbed 76% of available defensive rebounds; the Hawks grabbed 74.6% of available defensive rebounds.
* A final metric is the ratio of free throw per field goal attempt (FT/FGA - the lower the better). Golden St. ranked #17 at .208; the Hawks ranked #4 at .198.

More specifically to the question of a possible Warriors vs. Cavs Finals, many have wondered whether or not the Cavs can keep up their historic 3pnt shooting (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cavs-3-point-barrage-in-game-2-was-ridiculous/ | http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2016/05/11/analytics-art-cavaliers-sizzle-from-3-point-range-in-2016-playoffs/ | http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_active_p.html | https://hoopshabit.com/2016/05/08/cleveland-cavaliers-3-point-shooting-sustainable/). Consider:

* The Warriors ranked #2 by allowing opponents to shoot 33.2% from beyond the arc; the Hawks ranked #6 at 33.8%.
* Golden St. ranked #13 in 3's allowed (1,927 = 23.5 3's allowed per game or 26.3% of opponent FGA); Atlanta ranked #16 (2,008 = 24.4 3's allowed per game or 28.4% of FGA).
* Golden St. allowed opponents to shoot 35.8% on corner 3's (representing 18.3% of opponent 3PA); the Hawks allowed opponents to shoot 37.6% on corner 3's (representing 25.3% of opponent 3PA).
* 77.3% of 3PM versus Golden St. were assisted; 84.1% of 3PM versus Atlanta were assisted. 

None of this means that the Cavs will average ~19 3PM per game against the Warriors (or the Raptors, Heat, Thunder, or Spurs). None of this means that the Cavs will continue to shoot better from beyond the 3P line than inside of it. (It may suggest that the Cavs corner 3P and/or assisted 3PM will decline a bit.) What this DOES MEAN, however, is that Amin Elhassan's assertion that the Warriors defensive this season was substantially better than any defense the Cavs have seen in the Playoffs this season is demonstrably false. At best, the Hawks and Warriors were comparable defensive teams during the regular season; at worst, the Hawks may have been a bit better (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hawks-have-a-better-shot-at-stopping-the-cavs-this-time/).

So, while it is true that the Cavs are more likely to regress to their regular season shooting numbers (35% of their FGA were from 3P, where they shot 36.3% (on 2,427 3PA)) than continue their current blistering pace (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2016/05/09/cavs-offense-can-carry-them-to-finals-even-if-historic-three-point-shooting-cools/ | http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15494567/nba-playoffs-2016-cleveland-cavaliers-continue-hitting-3-pointers | ), the regular season numbers suggest that it won't be because Golden St. is far superior than Atlanta at defending the 3.

You mentioned kind of the chess match. Is that the team you were talking about -- how Atlanta tried different ways to defend them?

So far, there hasn't been a chess match. They've been too good. It was one thing against us, but I watched that Atlanta series with great interest. Atlanta was the second-best defensive team in the league, and I'm thinking, ""This'll be great, to watch how they defend Cleveland."" And they didn't even have as good luck as we did.

They tried everything -- Kent Bazemore on LeBron, Paul Millsap on him, starting Thabo Sefolosha, all kinds of switching.

You have two guys like LeBron and Kyrie Irving who can take you off the dribble, [Love is] maybe the best inside-outside big guy in the league, and then everyone is shooting at that level -- I don't know what your options even are. I didn't have an answer. I'm anxious to watch the next two rounds and see if someone else does something that works better.

But they've played at an extremely high level, and if they are going to shoot the ball like this, they have as good a chance to win the championship as anybody, East or West.

Now, I don't know they can go four series shooting like that.

I don't see how it's possible.

When they did it against Atlanta's defense, I guess I really took notice. We were a slightly above-average defensive team, but when you look at what Atlanta was able to build defensively and saw what Cleveland did to them -- wow.",0.49,controversial,5/13/16 2:13

What was done to solve this? Lose their best floor spacer and their closer. Nothing done to add complementary prices to the bench. 

Tobías is better suited at the 4, but Hortford will now assume that role, though it is not his natural role. Josh Richardson is nowhere near the shooter JJ was. Josh also has a tendency to slash more than JJ and while his metrics show he was more effective spotting up, his volume in that area is a much smaller sample compared to JJ. 

The bench was not upgraded - depth was an issue last year as well, but at least they had four all-stars. 

The 76ers smallest player will be 6’6” (Josh) and 6’9” on average - a huge lineup. I know Al is very quick for his size, and so is Ben, but the direction the league is tending makes me doubt that the 76ers will be as elite on Defense as the media has implied. 

The team did not get better on the break. Josh will push with Ben, but the rest of their players are not big time floor runners, neither is anyone off of their bench. 

The slowed pace will likely be most effective against Indiana or Orlando, who already play slow - I do not think they can withstand the Bucks even with Al on Giannis. The Nets will push pace, the Celts will push, the Heat will push. 

All this assumes Ben and Joel stay healthy. There is an insurance policy for Joel in Al, and an okay filler for Ben in Josh. 

Ben needs to develop a shot. Embid needs to stay healthy and show up when it counts, even then I don’t see them as better than last year. 4th seed IMO and a second round exit.

Info:  Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and immature. Rattlesnakes sense kingsnakes' presence by their odor.[18] When they realize a kingsnake is nearby, they begin enacting a set of defensive postures known as ""body bridging"". Unlike its normal erect and coiled defensive-striking posture, the rattlesnake keeps its head low to the ground in an attempt to prevent the kingsnake from gaining a hold.

279,Does twitter and YouTube know more about basketball than this sub,3,etuhcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/etuhcn/does_twitter_and_youtube_know_more_about/,33,1580005833,"I’ll start by saying there are many valuable contributors on here, and back in the day I’d learn something every day reading this sub.


But the Bucks Hornets PGT just summed up this subs hive mind for mine. Hornets are like what 15-31 with a mediocre coach and a mediocre roster. But last night we played the best game of our season by far. JB’s coaching was spot on for once, going small vs Giannis with surprising efficacy, and with PJ guarding Giannis super well on drives. Malik Monk dropped 31/5/5 with ELITE defence. Tae showed his craftiness and still hit some shots. 


Like rewatch that game man. Giannis literally grabbed offensive boards over those guys to bail out bricks from some of these Bucks guys to get them the win. Late game Malik was still getting clutch buckets vs Donte without any screen to create separation, just straight up ISOs because our coach played him offball basically most of the game(which again is so idiotic, he turns it over but his vision is insane. Look at this kinda pass: https://twitter.com/richierandall/status/1220831983762399233?s=21).


Now let’s look at the Hornets Bucks PGT top comments: 

- “Giannis in the 4th: aight well I guess we should win the game and shit” (527 upvotes at time of voting: verbal fellatio but completely fair because without him they don’t win this one. 
- “40-6 sounds so much more substantial than 39-6. Them bucks is good “ (262 upvotes at time of writing): again completely fair. Monumental achievement by a GREAT team
- “Yes folks Batum really is that bad.. 1/8 shooting for 5pts in 34 minutes in your only regular season game ever in your home country.” (109 upvotes “ “)again completely founded
- “Phil Jackson said if you reach 40 wins before 20 losses you are a contender. But these guys reached 40 wins before 10 losses. It's absolutely unreal” (289 upvotes “ “) ok sure another one about 40 wins, again fair.
- “40 wins before 20 losses. We a real contender” (172 upvotes “ “) ok again fair, reference to Phil’s quote. But surely those comments stop there...
- “i have the feeling the bucks kept the game close for us poor french but then decided to win late in the fourth” (51 upvotes) no talk about our strategic doubling, our small ball lineups, our strong halfcourt O spearheaded by our future backcourt Tae and Malik, or PJ’s strong ISO defence on Giannis and our aggressive help off bad shooters like Donte and Bledsoe. The worst so far, but excusable. 
- “40-6 and still need to win 9 more just to get on pace for 73-9.i sometimes forget how ridiculous that streak was.” (126 upvotes “ “) ok now it’s getting repetitive.
- “That was a pretty solid, competitive game until the Bucks woke up and completely took over during the final six minutes” (84 upvotes “ “)ok I’ll take this but I don’t think the Bucks “woke up” I think Giannis kept dominating the glass which saved this team from an embarrassing loss to a team that’s 15-31
- “Donte DiVincenzo is a future all star” (113 upvotes);  ok I’ll accept it because he’s super underrated by non Bucks fans but he did get cooked by Malik consistently in one on one situations...just saying. And his ballhandling and PnR skills aren’t quite all star level yet although he could reach there. He’s got great court vision, and he’ll be all defence one day. Very good player. 
- “The consistency in which the bucks play this year is amazing.....at home or on the road, good team bad team doesn't matter, imo that's the biggest reason why Giannis is MVP handily it's a direct reflection of his leadership and the way he plays on both sides of the ball” (34 upvotes): wouldn’t say this is a great win. Hornets showed that Bucks still struggle with Bledsoe spotting up and shooting, Hornets showed Bucks defence is prone to giving up wide open 3s since we had so many practice shots. Hornets showed going small not a death sentence vs Bucks and hence Boston and Stevens probably would be watching this tape and  using it for their own defenders. Maybe they use Ojeleye or Brown in the PJ on Giannis, objected with stating in front of Giannis, while elite help defenders like Tatum and Williams come over and help.
- “It was close for two and half quarters, I'll take it
- “Also MONKKKKKK. He better get more fucking consistent playing time now. The second best guard (arguably best tbh) on the roster behind Graham. This isn't meant to be Rozier slander btw, it's just he is not a good point guard at all, he's a good catch and shoot player” (57 upvotes): shoutout my fucking guy u/buzzbuzz01 for being a hornets fan and somehow getting more than 10 upvotes on a comment in this thread.
- “Robin Lopez is a thot. He's a freaking nasty hoe. His hair is so good. I'd love Robin to beat my ass like a mascot and tell me all about the benefits of looking homeless. If a 7 foot tall Sideshow Bob shows up with comic books and his twin brother he can fuck me up any fucking time of day dude. If a guy's like 'I come off the bench but I'll make you feel things you've never felt before' i'm like 'slam a basketball in my ass like its the Slam Dunk contest my dude'.” (67 upvotes): ok one of these is fine I guess. Unnecessary given he didn’t really do anything in game; he’s a cult hero but save it for when he does something.


Finally after trawling through all these comments, I find this nice one from a guy with a Greece flair u/de_grecia:


- “Good game by the Hornets. Gave it all. Wasn't enough though. The Bucks might indeed go all the way”
How many upvotes? A whopping 12.

Now, let’s go to the YouTube video for Bucks Hornets highlights here: https://youtu.be/vhcHamiNh1g

- “Man Charlotte came to play” ( 9 likes)
- “Fantastic play by the hornets but Giannis is unreal” (35 likes): completely true and simple summation of the game. Bucks are contenders for a reason but hornets played the best game they’ve played this season.
- “ what an effort by the hornets “ (11 likes)


Finally this one which I’ll link in a comment below because I don’t have an imgur account and where I’m from it’s 5.30 AM and I can’t sleep. 



Overall, I mean YouTube just has far more complementary, humble, and well researched comments than the r/nba PGT. Why do we o  it ourselves in a high pedestal here when we’re, in a game between two sets of pretty good fans(hornets and bucks), there was literally like 2 comments of quality analysis out of 152 in a PGT of a playoff quality match.


And then r/nba mods bans users like u/jaynay1 who provide ELITE analysis every damn night on the hornets subreddit. He’s difficult but is cancer like the stuff we saw above in anyway valuable to this subreddit’s health? If you wanna learn the game, go there, or follow guys like anyone with “The Stephen”, Fastbreak basketball, Skyfall, Brian Geisinger/Richie Randall(quality hornets analysis and film). Don’t go to r/nba and pray that some awesome user like u/dropdatdurkadurk (can’t think of any others off the top of my head but y’all know who you are, those guys grinding out legit quality analysis in PGT just for us fans who didn’t watch the game’s sake) can be arsed writing anything of substance given more than likely someone just ignores it",0.51,controversial,1/25/20 18:30

- The Cavs had a stud core for Lebron (Kyrie was **22** and Love was **25**). They had Tristan Thompson who was on the up and up and full of potential and only **23**. Waiters Island was full of tourists an despite his personality quirks, Dion was full of promise and talent and only **23**.

- They had something no Lebron team has had: Additional assets -- They had a TWO 1st Rounder from Memphis and OKC owed to them (later flipped TWO first rounders for Mozgov who hardly played for their Championship team) and they had all their draft Picks.

And now? They are an old, essentially talent deficient core aside from LeBron. This team was supposed to get **better** as Lebron aged due to the cores age. 

I know it's easy to say it all collapsed when Kyrie left but even with him, this team was playing well below their potential and hype they garnered.

""There was no doubt in my mind that Mahorn, and later Dantley, was trying to hurt me,"" the angry Jordan said. 

Meanwhile, Dantley and teammate Isiah Thomas thought that the Bulls, especially Jordan and Collins, overreacted.

""Every top player is going to take his lumps and get knocked to the floor, and I think Jordan has to learn that"", Dantley said. 

""Do you mean you can never touch a guy? When I led the league in scoring, I used to get banged up every night, sometimes harder than Jordan was.""

However, the continued focus of this board upon this topic seems odd given the the far more significant news of KD's injury. One of the top 2-3 players in the game may have been irrevocably injured and it may have been entirely avoidable. Most people were eager to see him play, 

We could be considering:

1. whether KD pressured the FO to let him play
2. whether the FO should have taken his preference into consideration (cause players will always want to play) 
3. whether the FO or the media actually pressured KD to play

_____

**1) Passing**

+ Chris Paul may finish his career as a 19-10 guy, which would be historical and unprecedented. I don't think Curry will ever reach that, but he could see his assist numbers rise if he wanted. However, that assist:TO is absurd. Paul is giving his team between 8-12 points for every one time he costs them a possession. I'm about to make a stat up, but that's at least 8ppm (points per mistake). Curry's is still good for an NBA point guard, but Paul's is transcendent.
+ Sheer numbers wise, Chris Paul just runs an offense in a very traditional way. He is every coach's dream. Put it this way: if a 5'8-6'0 freshman walked into basketball tryouts in high school and played the way Paul does, he would get sent straight to varsity and possibly even see loads of court time. Nothing is better than a point guard who can pass, shoot, defend, and not turn the ball over. Curry would take time to win the coaches ever, much like he has taken time to win fans over, and that's not a knock on him; it's just the way the game goes. It's changing now, but at every level, Paul's passing and decision making when passing is a tier above the rest of the NBA, and it has been for the past six or seven years.
+ Curry makes much flashier passes than Chris Paul, wows the crowd more, and actually has the ability to make certain passes that Paul can't because teams attempt to deter Curry from the three point line with more reckless abandon than dog owners deter their dogs from chocolate cake. However, Curry's flair for that signature behind the back pass leads to a few turnovers and embarrassing out of bounds bounces. Paul makes the right pass and gets flashy with lobs and threading the needle. It's subtle, not as flashy, but more effective in game and in getting Paul assists. This is personal preference, but I'd rather have a guy hit my players in their shooting pockets 9/10 times than a flashy behind the back pass that they have to adjust for. But until Curry starts hitting his players in rhythm with those flashy passes among other passing nuances...
+ Advantage: **Chris Paul**

________

**2) Shooting**

+ The absolute number one thing that stands out: Curry is a much better shooter. Given that we widely regard Chris Paul as an elite shooter, to have Curry extend even beyond that is mindboggling. Chris Paul is a better career midrange shooter: career ~47% between 3 and 16 feet. Compared to Curry: ~42.5% between 3 and 16 feet. However, Curry is getting better and better, with his average this year around 47% as well. 
+ eFG% measures the efficiency of shooting, and Curry blows Paul away in that regard. 
+ Steph Curry's off the dribble shooting, quick release, and uncanny ability to score threes off 7+ dribbles almost as efficiently as the rest of the league does *uncontested* (don't know where I saw this stat, Nylon Calculus I believe) makes him the greatest shooter of all time on pure skill and versatility. He also does have the two best seasons ever when it comes to made threes. Oh and the most in the playoffs. By 42. 
+ Huge advantage: **Steph Curry**

________

**3) Scoring**

+ They are both equally as skilled around the basket when it comes to finish. Paul absorbs contact better (or at least more consistently) and is craftier with those bank shots (sorry, San Antonio), whereas Curry has all kinds of spins, floaters, scoops and rainbows that make him the fucking Baskin Robbins of finishing around the rim.
+ True shooting wise, which measures the efficiency of scoring, Curry is just slightly ahead of Paul, probably due in part to his more accurate three point shooting. 
+ They each have their signature moves: Curry with the firecracker, electrify the crowd, this-is-straight-of-a-streetballer's-wet-dream pull up three; Paul with the, ""I don't care if I'm 6'0 and 180lbs, fuck you I'm Chris Paul"" off-the-dribble elbow jumper. Both are effective, though off-the-dribble three point shooting is just statistically more likely to go cold for longer stretches. But when Curry is hot, his signature move is unstoppable and significantly more demoralizing than Paul's, though the Spurs might have something to say about that.
+ Honestly, they score in different ways, and while Curry is more prone to go for 50 than CP3, Paul can take over at any given point and can often times subtly score 30 through a collection of tough midrange jays and timely threes. When Curry's going off, you know he's going off. With Paul it's subtle. Plus his scoring is good enough where you have to choose whether you want him to hang 40 on you or hang 15 assists on you. With Curry, 40 spells almost certain doom. This one comes down to preference.
+ Advantage: **wash**

________

**4) Handles**

+ Well, there isn't exactly a concrete way or statistical way to measure this. But Paul's found himself on the other end of Curry highlights a couple too many times. The way I like to think of it is that Curry has the ball on a string and does what he pleases with his dribble moves, weaving, awing, and just flat out dominating. Paul's hands are a prison and the ball is trapped within it. He does less, but at times he's much safer about his dribbling.
+ Paul can protect the ball and control it at the transcendent level required for a top point guard of all-time, which leads to less turnovers. Curry could easily control the ball more, but his game is much more predicated on the dazzle of it all. Curry's a magician. Sleight of hand. The turn. The prestige. But make no mistake, there is substance to his style, and if he can further refine when (to dazzle) and how (to use it most efficiently), this won't even be a discussion anymore. As it is...
+ Slight advantage: **Curry**

__________

**5) Defense**

+ Holy shit. Just holy shit. Paul's defense, both effort, skill, lateral quickness, ability to play passing lanes, pickpocketing skills... he has it all. While he has lost a bit and is not as quick as he was before his knee injury, Paul can still defend every point guard in the league admirably, even if it means getting crossed up every now and again. Plus a career DRTG of 104 is very, very impressive. 
+ Curry used to be a bad defender, letting defenders cut by him, letting himself take plays off, but he quickly improved his help defense and is a solid presence on the court. He plays passing lanes well and gets a good jump on the ball. Paul is just a little bit better in that aspect. And a lot better in others. Plus he has that eye test intangible of absolute abandon and tenacity on D.
+ Huge advantage: **Paul**

_________

**6) Versatility**

+ Curry is not the one trick pony we know him to be, that's for sure. He can lead a team and create in many ways. Plus he has that undeniable gravity to his game. He could be 0-21 but you would never dare leave him open, lest you find yourself looking worse than Sheed in '05. He sees the defense well and passes it well, whether it be to Splash Bro Klay or the Bogue-ster (just made that up, sorry). The Warriors were an elite offensive team this year, and Curry was the lead star. Is that Kerr/Gentry's scheme or is it Curry? Probably both. But he ran it beautifully and played to his strengths.
+ 123 ORTG? What. CP3 has regularly led an elite offensive in the Clippers every year he's been there and was the driving force behind a potent attack in NOLA as well. He commands a team and runs whatever scheme fits the other players best. He also plays to his strengths, which happen to be all of them. Stick Paul into any offense and they'd be improved. Even Golden State. Not by much, but by a little.
+ Curry would also improve many offenses. He just has to be the focus. On a team like the Clippers or the Cavs, he would be able to score and command the offense, but cohesion with any player, in almost any system, is lacking. This comes down to somewhat of a preference- rook or slightly nerfed queen? Curry explodes when in the right situation; Paul can do it all, as a queen moves all over the chess border, though he can't quite go all the way as a rook does (say the queen had a 5 space max in every direction). Also yes, that was a double entendre. But this question is about versatility after all.
+ Slight advantage: **Paul**

_________

**7) The Next Level**

+ Back to the versatility thing; Chris Paul may be running a top level offense every year, but consistency is nothing if you never peak.
+ Curry is peaking, and hey, Paul did in 08 and 09, averaging 11.6 and 11 assists respectively, along with 17.8 and 18.3 win-shares, but Curry peaked on a top 10 team of all-time. He won 67 games and went 16-5 in the playoffs against three 53+ win teams and the other four members of the All-NBA 1st Team. 
+ He averaged 28.3 points in the playoffs, and probably would have averaged 30 if he hadn't turned in a dud of a Game 2 in the Finals. 
+ Curry has an MVP, and while Paul definitely deserved one in 2008, he is soaring. We expect the same consistency out of Paul next season, but we can definitely see Curry taking it up even another notch. And that's too scary to ignore.
+ Advantage: **Curry**

__________

**8) Fuck You Factor**

+ Before the Finals, I had this all on CP3. I mean, that scowl on his face and that intense look he gets when he's priming to go off? That's got a big ""fuck you"" written all over it. Plus the Hammy game. That's an all-time great performance. And many more instances where he realized that his bench was terrible and that he had knee problems, not back ones. He just took over, and I wish he did it more, but it's definitely there and it's definitely scary.
+ But then Curry did something so savage. In a span of four minutes in Game 5, he turned Matthew Dellavedova from unsung hero into the recipient of the biggest stink face since Brandon Knight. Dear God. I don't really like Steph Curry because of what he did to Georgetown and I like to hold 7 year grudges but man, he said ""Fuck you Delly, fuck you r/NBA, and fuck you too Michael Jordan."" That's impressive. 
+ Still, Paul has a history of it, and for me, plays like the DJ-shoot-the-fucking-ball and the Dwight-tackle, have that factor in spades. But... Curry did it in the Finals. In a must-win Game 5. In the face of his fuckboy defender. On a shot I don't think I've even seen in a 2K montage. Steph could have shat in my backyard the very same day and that shot still would have been fire. And his attitude is getting there too.
+ Slight advantage: **Curry**

___________

**9) Meaning to His City/Cities and the Game**

+ In NOLA, Chris Paul was in the DWade/Lebron/Duncan/Kobe/Nash/Dirk tier, but when he landed in LAC, he became the second fiddle in what will always be Kobe's city. Still, he is beloved in LAC and they wouldn't trade him for anything except maybe Lebron and Kyrie together. He brought basketball to OKC, he and Drew Brees were the unbroken levies in a broken city rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurrican Katrina, and he has played with heart and passion for years. That 61 point game in honor of his grandpa's 61 years of life... incredible. 
+ Today, after bringing a historic season to the Bay Area and winning MVP, I'm pretty sure (to quote Bill Simmons) they'd trade the Golden Gate Bridge before Steph Curry. He is beloved by the media, by the fans, and comes from a family that the NBA wants to be their classier version of the Kardashians. Just wait till Seth makes the NBA again and has a kid marginally less adorable than Riley. 
+ Curry's the hero; Paul's the villain. It's what makes this debate so fun. But, it has been said that you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. And that's what happened to CP3. But the thing about the NBA is that you don't become a villain by just being around for a long time; you have to be *good* for that long. 
+ Slight advantage: **Paul**

Efficiency wise if a player is a huge plus on offense it makes sense to have them expend the majority of their energy getting points instead of making high energy cost/low return defensive plays. Especially when that player is by far the most effective offensive player on the team. 

Lebrons famous 48 minute playoff games utilize this strategy and Harden is the highest usage player in league history so it’s less about defensive skill as opposed to a strategic decision. 

This is why Harden prefers to guard bigs in the post where his style is more about stealing low rather than jumping to block. And when looking at his defensive efficiency in the post it’s up there with the best in the league.

Defense isn’t necessarily about the flashy blocks of a Giannis or the scrappy pestering of a Pat Beverly. It’s about not letting the other team score the ball and Harden does a good not great job at that. I rest my case.",0.48,controversial,9/2/19 23:21

&#x200B;

 Jalen not in bold

I spoke to Rose on Wednesday, before Game 3 of the Finals, which he was covering from Oakland. I had been interested in talking about his basketball and media career, but I started by asking him about the analytics movement, which has revolutionized most major sports, and Rose and I spent most of our conversation discussing it. During the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed the racial dynamics that he sees underlying various sports debates, the good and the bad of the so-called “player-empowerment era,” and whether he was kidding when he recently went on television and [cast doubt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_ce4QGqiNw) on the moon landing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It seems to me that a lot of ex-players don’t like the increasing focus on analytics and advanced stats in the conversation around sports. Do you think that is fair as a generalization, and if so, why do you think that is?**

&#x200B;

Oh, wow, you are going to start off with a don’t-get-fired topic that I am going to pull you behind the curtain on, if you really want to know the impetus behind the backlash.

&#x200B;

**I’m all ears.**

&#x200B;

No. 1, there are many people that feel like it has a cultural overtone to it that basically suggests that, even though I may not have played and you did, I am smarter than you, and I know some things that you don’t know, and the numbers support me, not you. Two, you notice that, when it is a powerful job in sports—whether it is an owner, whether it is a president, whether it is a general manager, whether it is a coach—usually in football and basketball, sports that are primarily dominated by black Americans, it’s also an opportunity to funnel jobs to people by saying that, “I am smarter than you because the numbers back up what I say, and I am more read. I study more. I am able to take these numbers and manipulate my point.” It’s almost like when you hear that a player doesn’t have experience at doing X job. People that normally get the jobs you are describing don’t, either. They didn’t play at most levels, but that suffices as their “experience” and validates their opportunity for power.

&#x200B;

**Just to be clear, when you say “cultural overtones,” you mean racial overtones?**

&#x200B;

Correct. And one other point I want to make with that: it is laughable to me when playing experience gets equated to any other type of experience, including coaching. When you play—for example, somebody like me, who has been playing my entire life—for some strange reason that experience gets diminished when it’s time to talk about powerful positions in sports—like, He doesn’t have experience. There is no bigger experience than being in the foxhole, in the huddles, and out on the floor—being a part of the game plan and being game-planned against. But also all the people you learn from: your teammates, the coaches, how to navigate with the media, how to navigate with the fans. Instead of it being, He doesn’t have experience, it really should be, He has more experience than almost anybody walking the earth.

&#x200B;

**When you say “manipulate,” do you think that analytics people are doing something dishonest for their own ends, or do you just think they don’t have the experience? “Manipulate” is a loaded word.**

&#x200B;

I am saying it becomes an entry point, a validation.

&#x200B;

And let me say this: I give myself a forehead slap like the Three Stooges when I hear players and ex-players say that somebody can’t cover the game that didn’t actually play the game. That is also extremely incorrect. Just because you played the game, that doesn’t mean that you are best at analyzing the game, or coaching the game, or working in the front office. It’s the totality of the individual that allows special people to be able to juggle and be successful at both.

&#x200B;

**For many years, political reporters would go out to some diner in Pennsylvania, and they were really experienced at travelling and meeting people and reporting their opinions. More recently, statistics experts and polling experts came in—like Nate Silver, who works at your company—and they basically said that, rather than going to diners, we can learn a lot about the American electorate and voting patterns by analyzing data in a complex way. Even though a lot of these people have no experience reporting, they have incredible insight into the American electorate. I wonder if you think that is a fair comparison.**

&#x200B;

I think what you say does make sense. I appreciate the example. It’s a great one. However, numbers can be manipulated. Look no further than our current election and how it played out. If you were paying attention to all the polls, we would not have thought that the result would end up being \[what it was\], if you are going only by the numbers. Numbers can be manipulated. Statistics for me are things you can count: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals. Analytics are things that you quantify: player-efficiency rating (P.E.R.), usage, net whatever. I think analytics should be a tool in the box, not the actual toolbox.

&#x200B;

**Right, but everything except points, such as rebounds, assists, blocks, steals—all these things are ways of analyzing the goal of the game, which is scoring more points than your opponent. So even if it is a more complex formula like P.E.R., it’s still the same thing. It’s just a more complex and accurate version of what people have been doing forever, which is looking at box scores.**

&#x200B;

The stats that I just described, for example, for me, they physically take place. I can physically watch a game and see them. By the way, I am not a big stats guy. I am an impact person.

&#x200B;

**Meaning?**

&#x200B;

I know just because you had five steals doesn’t mean you are a great defensive player.

Since the Warriors did not have enough players, I allowed them to keep Speights and Barbosa. Minimal Impact from both.

**[Game 1:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065546&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** The Warriors come off to a bad start against the Chicago Bulls but thanks to the rallying of Curry and Durant, the Warriors lead a comeback to win Game 1. If you look towards the bottom, player of the game goes to Steph.

Interesting Box Score Stats:
Luc Longely scored 19 points and grabbed 7 boards.
Rodman had 19 boards.

**Warriors lead 1-0**






**[Game 2:](https://www.whatifsports.com/nba/boxscore.asp?GameID=13065560&nomenu=1&teamfee=-1)** The Warriors overall had a good game but were led by Klay, Curry and Durant with help from Draymonds rebounding. Michael Jordan did all he could to keep the Bulls in the game, but strong performances in the second and third quarter helped the Warriors stay in the game.

294,Why Raw PPG is significantly overrated and the importance of efficiency,0,3uyr9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3uyr9x/why_raw_ppg_is_significantly_overrated_and_the/,73,1448978486,"Warning: Long post but I think it can help alot of people understand why we tend to overrate Volume scoring and underrate efficiency.



Among various discussions on nba reddit, I'm surprised to see how many people don't understand the incredible importance of efficiency. Some definitely get it, but others clearly don't understand. 


There is also a significant overrating of raw scoring, while it is definitely valuable, on it's own without taking into context the efficiency of the scoring it is easy to overrate how valuable it is. 


This is primarily in response to comments in a specific thread regarding a question about 00-01 Lakers vs current warriors where a comment was made that the Lakers had two players then (Shaq and Kobe) better than any player on the warriors (Curry).
Then a discussion ensued where comments were made that essentially curry's efficiency is very overrated/irrelevant. 


Now this isn't to spark some thread about Kobe vs Curry, blah blah etc., so please if you're a huge Kobe or Shaq fan don't take this as a shot at them because it completely isn't. I love kobe/shaq. This is to help highlight just how incredibly important efficiency is, and I'm using this an example since it was recently relevant to a discussion. 


Basketball is a team sport, what's ultimately important is how much a player is helping their TEAM score as many points on the team's number of possessions per game. Then of course on the flip side how much a person helps their team stop the opposing team from scoring on their number of possessions per game. 


It doesn't matter how impressive the scoring ""looks"" from a viewer standpoint or how much effort or willpower it takes that player to score those points. What matters is how it's ultimately impacting the team. 


First, the ""amount"" of points a player scores, on it's own isn't valuable. There are a finite amount of possessions a team has in a game. If a star player is injured or leaves a team, the shot attempts he took don't just disappear. 


What IS valuable is: 

1. How much more efficiently that player scores on his shot attempts compared to how efficiently the team could score those shot attempts without him. 

2. How much more efficiently that player helps his teammates score 
 

Now I'm going to break down the difference in value of Shaq and Kobe's regular season numbers in 2000-2001 compared to Curry's right now. (Now while I find it unlikely he maintains this rate of scoring and efficiency, the discussion was related to how curry is playing currently). 


In the 2000-2001 season: 
Shaq averaged 28.7 points on a TS% of 57.4  

Kobe averaged 28.5 points on a TS% of 55.2

Not including tonight's game since it isn't updated yet on Bballreference:
 
Curry is averaging 31.9 points on a TS% of 69.1
 
Now as I mentioned previously, when a player is gone those shot attempts don't disappear and the offense adapts.  
Now, even if you removed one of these players from let's say the 0-18 sixers, a team that is intentionally tanking, that offense is still going to find a way to convert those shots at a TS% of 50.2(sixers current TS%). So the actual ""Real"" value of the player's scoring is the difference between that player's efficiency on those shots and the team's efficiency on those shots without him. 


Now the actual math for this will be off some decimal points because TS% isn't 100% exact as there is a coefficient for free throws that don't use up a possession such as technicals and and-1's. 



In 2000-2001 Shaq took 19.1 FGA and 13.1 FTA. Now since 2 free throws is approximately 1 possession, I'm going to cut them in half to come up with a generally close approximation of how many ""shot possessions"" Shaq used. 
19.1 + 6.5  would be essentially 25.6 ""Shot possessions"" that Shaq used to score his 28.7 points. 

Now if you're not that great with numbers and want to know more in depth how this is calculated I don't mind posting in the comments how, it's relatively simple. Just wanted to save from using up even more space as this post is long enough. 

Now if you take those 25.6 ""Shot possessions"" Shaq used and convert them to how many points the Sixers would score on those possessions(a TS% of 50.2) you will get approximately 25.8 points.

Shaq averaged 28.7, a difference of 2.9. I'll give a margin of error of .5 points because of the TS% coefficient. 

So although Shaq averaged 28.7 PPG, the ""Real"" Value of that scoring to even the 0-18 sixers is about  3 - 3.5 points. Then there's also value in how efficiently Shaq helps his teammates score with his presence and attention which would be another couple points or so. 
 
Shaq's OBPM that year was 5.7, now while it's not a perfect stat, it's  the only one that spans decades for a comparison and is still a general good predictor. When also taking into account the value of his actual scoring as I previously calculated at 3-3.5 points, an OBPM of 5.7 seems reasonable.

If you do the same math for Kobe in 00-01:

He scored 28.5 points on 26.3 ""Shot possessions""

At a TS% of 50.2, the sixers would score approximately 26.4 points on those shots, a difference of 2.1. So with a margin of error, the actual ""Real"" value of Kobe's points were 2-2.7 points.
Then he has added value helping his teammate's score efficiently. His OBPM that year was 5.3


Now for Stephen Curry: Curry is scoring 32.1 points on about 23.5 ""shot possessions""

On those same shot attempts the sixers would score roughly 23.6 points.

An astounding difference of 8.5

So with a Margin of error the ""Real"" Value Of Curry's current scoring is 8.5 - 9 points. Then he also has the added value of how much his presence helps his teammates score efficiently. His OBPM is currently 12.9

That is how INSANLEY valuable efficiency is. The actual value of Curry's Current scoring(8.5-9 points) is greater than Shaq and Kobe's that year COMBINED (5 - 6.2). His OBPM currently (12.9) is also greater than Shaq and Kobe's that year combined (11.2)


To provide even further support (the TEAM's offense) that these players are impacting, the Warriors right now are on pace to have the best offense of all time.


Their offensive rating right now: 115.6

The Lakers offensive rating in 2000-2001: 108.4

A team with Shaq and Kobe is scoring an astronomical 7.2 points less per 100 possessions than the Curry led Warriors.

The Curry we've seen so far this season is a broken blip in the Matrix and goes to show how immensely valuable efficiency is.

I don't care though. I just want to express my thoughts on this whole suspension incident.

So, it seems like every other post in the last 48 hours has been about either how dirty and disrespectful it was of Lebron to step over Draymond, or more recently about how ridiculous the suspension is. Let me get this straight: People are saying that because Lebron stepped over Green (sure, a little disrespectfully) that Draymond's act of slapping Lebron directly in the nuts is entirely justified. 

I just don't get it. We're talking about Draymond Green here, the guy who just a couple weeks ago blatantly kicked Steven Adams in the nuts. And a few days before that kneed him in the nuts. I respect him as a player, but the fact is that he's pretty dirty and occasionally reckless. There are tons of other incidents of his over-physicality and recklessness. Even in these playoffs, to name one, when he threw Michael Beasley to the ground at the end of game
3 of the Houston series. I don't understand where the justification is coming from here. Why in the world are people saying this suspension is BS?? Draymond Green blatantly and intentionally slapped Lebron James in the balls. I think that warrants a suspension.

Now, I understand the notion that the suspension is ridiculous because Draymond didn't get suspended for the kick to Adams last series. I certainly think he should have been suspended for that, but that doesn't make me criticize the NBA for their decision on this incident. Why would they make the same mistake twice?

Last year he was really owned by Bob Voulgaris in Rockets vs Celtics situations stuff, but you could call him being biased, because he’s a fan on one of those teams. 

But at his latest podcast he went even further.

He claimed that Jrue, Lonzo, Ingram and Zion Team is a western conference caliber playoff team. After that he corrected himself, claiming that they are “one move away”, talking about bringing rim protection.

I mean how could you believe in a claim like that seriously, when Jrue is by far their best 3PT shooter among those guys and so-called rim protector, making less than 2FG’s per game on 35% shooting?

Especially after talking for half of an hour approximately about the Lakers, their mess over the last couple of seasons, especially the last one, where the - TA-DAM - lack of consistent shooting clearly ran that team straight into the ground.

I’m cool with him picking 65+ wins for the Boston team, he’s a well-known Celtics homer, but naming the guys and clearly being unable to recognize the weaknesses on a fly is just terrible, especially when you are talking about the potential team around Zion, who’s like Giannis or LeBron is going to get doubled since late October because of how freakishly athletic he really is.

In games Durant played, they had a 57 win pace.

With Durant limited to just 27 games in 2014-15, the Thunder had a losing record in games Durant missed and **failed to make the playoffs** (playing at their typical 57 win pace in games Durant played).   

Not surprisingly, Westbrook's efficiency dropped that season to 42% from FG and 29% from the line.  It seems Durant's presence has a positive effect on Westbrook's efficiency.

Based on this limited sample size, one could make the case that the Thunder, without Durant, would struggle to make the playoffs and might even finish below .500.

One note:  Westbrook missed time that season as well.  I primarily looked at games Durant missed.  But the fact is, with Durant healthy they played at their typical 57 win pace.  Even with him playing 27 games (1/3rd of the season), the Thunder were a lottery team without a fully healthy Durant.  You could make the argument that Durant could join a 48 win team like the Celtics and they'd be more successful than the Thunder this season since the Durantless Celtics might compare favorably to the Durantless Thunder.

-----

How about the reverse? 

Well in 2013-14, Westbrook was limited to just 46 games.  In the 36 games he missed, the Thunder went 25-11 (including a 10 game win streak) - their typical 57 win pace.  The Thunder won 59 games that season in spite of Westbrook missing significant time.  

Additionally, Westbrook's absence seemed to have no negative effect on Durant's production.  In the 35 games Durant played without Westbrook, he put up averages of 32.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.2 steals, 51%/41%/89% shooting in 37.6mpg.   And for the full season, he posted career highs in points and assists - with no noticeable downtick in efficiency.

Based on this limited sample size, one could make the case that the Russell Westbrook's impact on Kevin Durant is similar to the impact Monta Ellis had on Steph Curry.  We might actually see Durant flourish without Westbrook (who has the highest usage rate in the league and has an assist/turnover rate that is 28th in the league).  

----

I understand the common narrative is that because the Thunder had limited success and Westbrook is a Superstar, Durant needs to play with Westbrook to be successful.  Unfortunately, the reality is that the Thunder were likely successful **BECAUSE OF DURANT**.  We once saw LeBron James win 66 games with Mo Williams as his 2nd best player.  Once he left, the Cavs were a 20 win team.  Do not discount the possibility that Durant, a legitimate Superstar, is the primary reason for the Thunder's success - and he may see even greater success by going to a team that has more complimentary pieces.

I've been reading Simmons for years now and he's a very, very entertaining, passionate fan and writer.  He loves the NBA, he loves sports, he loves pop culture, and he's a great read.  He's Entertaining.  Take him with several grains of salt and he's always fun to ingest.
BUT..
/r/nba has taken it to the next level.  You guys have begun taking whatever he says as canon and shouting it repeatedly and downvoting anyone to hell who doesn't agree.  This is bullshit.  Pure, unadulterated, bullshit.

Bill Simmons has been a self professed biased, conspiracy theory loving, drama seeking, storyline creating (even when one doesn't exist) writer Ever Since He Begun Writing.  People who have been reading him for years ARE USED TO IT.  We laugh at it.  Hell, I happily read Grantland daily, and have done so for years.  Years!  I am seriously wondering how many who are touting his words as gospel have even been closely watching the NBA for years.  I remember watching Kings (I am not even a Kings fan) league pass games well into the night and waking up the next morning to him giving incorrect assessments of what happened in those games down the stretch.  He's a good writer, but he will absolutely turn events to a way where it's exciting to read about and sometimes might not have happened.  We (longtime Simmons readers) Know to take it with many grains of salt.  ALL OF THE SUDDEN, after being introduced to this terrible ESPN crew, people are randomly taking his word as gospel.  It Is Not.  Some of it is great, and some of it is wrong.

Bill Simmons is a great fan, but he also interprets scenarios wrong and creates drama and storylines where none exist.  He pushes his agenda, like when he tries to promote one player over another and argues this assertion by recounting all the ""possible"" championships that a player ""should"" have (ala Tim Duncan, when he recounts all the ""once in a lifetime"" things that had to happen to keep him from several of his potential other championships... yet doesn't do the same argument [an argument that can easily be made] for other players) and says this should theoretically count towards a players legacy.  This is his thing.  He loves conjecture.  And That Is Okay!

What he is doing with Doc is conjecture and Celtics love mixed with heartbreak that his team is tearing apart.  It's clear that Doc and he now have bad blood, but for everyone to Immediately hop on his side as if he's done NOTHING wrong in ""calling out a coach"" who did nothing wrong besides seeking new employment is downright stupid.  Their beef now is strong, and I see both parties' point, in a manner.  Yet, the initial problem with Doc being offended at Simmons taking aim at him is absolutely valid.  No matter how much you guys want to love Everything Bill Simmons does: you need to relax.  There's a happy medium where you don't have to downvote every comment that doesn't praise him to being below threshold, where you can have an open enough mind to realize the situation from both sides.

This is all based on the information we as fans have, we obviously don't know EXACTLY what's going on. 

No one knows how Kawhi's body is feeling except for Kawhi, not even a team doctor. The fact that Tony Parker brought up his injury and said it was much worse was extremely disrespectful from my point of view. 

Kawhi has an outside medical team looking at his injury and they have not cleared him. This isn't his uncle saying he isn't healthy but trained professionals just like the team's doctors. This isn't to say that team doctors are compromised in any way but they definitely look out for the team and if it seems like Kawhi is say 95% ready they would probably clear him, while there is no incentive for an outside medical team to have any agenda. 

There have been players who have played through an injury and it ended up being a terrible decision. IT is a recent example of this. Yes, he also played due to personal reasons as he said it helped him cope with the death of his sister but he also wishes he got surgery sooner rather than play through it as it affected his play which is lowering his value. I don't think he would have ever gotten a max contract but it sure as hell would have been higher than what he's going to get now. If he sat out for the whole year coming off his play in Boston, it's likely he would have gotten more than he's gonna get now. 

The Spurs organization has been a model organization for the past 20 years but taking subtle shots at Kawhi is extremely unprofessional. If he doesn't feel ready, it's as simple as that. He isn't ready to play. They obviously want him to play because they pay him to play basketball and they need him to be an actual threat in the West. So while they care to have Kawhi healthy because he's their Super-Star player and want him to be healthy for years to come, they have an agenda in they also need him to play as soon as possible. While an outside medical staff has none of that and only want to get Kawhi healthy. 

Kawhi isn't ""quitting"" on his team just because he doesn't feel ready to play. I can also guarantee the subtle shots aren't motivating him to return either but rather more of a reason for him to stay away from playing until he's fully 100%. 

edit: TLDR; Kawhi doesn't feel 100% healthy and his outside medical staff who have absolutely no agenda aside from getting him healthy have not cleared him. The subtle shots from the Spurs are unprofessional and aren't going to encourage him to come back.

He carried that team to the playoffs with some fantastic play (Orlando Game, etc...). He’s averaged a triple-double for two consecutive seasons, a feat that has never been done before (Oscar did it for one season though).

Russ was generally thought of as the 7th best player after last season, and while you can make the case he should be ahead of Kawhi until we see Kawhi play again, this was fair. Then people started putting Giannis above Russ and that started a trend of massively underrating Westbrook. Threads have shown up asking if he’s a top 10 player and people are calling him a net negative to a team. Westbrook at absolute minimum should be 7th and the case could be made that he’s right behind Harden.

Let’s all remember that Russell Westbrook is an MVP and a superstar and deserves to be ranked as one.",0.53,controversial,8/14/18 4:19

After a whirlwind off season - surely the craziest in NBA history - I'd like to share my predictions for each team as I see them and create a ""way too early"" Power Rankings.  Without further ado...

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Denver Nuggets** \- I may be biased, but people are absolutely sleeping on Denver.  While they had a quiet off season, the addition of Jerami Grant was the perfect compliment to their already young and deep roster.  Toting the best center in the game in Nikola Jokic, Denver runs one of the best offenses in the NBA predicated on ball and player movement. They will be elite both offensively and defensively.  Jamal Murray will make his case for a top 5 PG in the game next season.  While other teams in the West made huge splashes, the Nuggets didn't need to.  They are absolutely deep and talented at every position.  Denver was the 2 seed last season and almost (should have) made it to the WCF.  Aside from having the best young core in the league, they also have the most intriguing prospect outside of Zion in Michael Porter Jr.  The playoff run they had last season was invaluable experience.  Watch out for the Nuggets.
2. **Los Angeles Clippers** \- Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is a ridiculous tandem on both ends of the floor.  Both are elite offense players and lock-down wing defenders.  Aside from these two, the Clippers are deep with players such as Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Ivica Zubac, and Landry Shamet.  The defensive trio of Bev/Klaw/PG13 is scary.  Lou Williams will continue to be the perfect 6th man and will be vital to ensure two elite offensive players are on the floor at all times.  I love the energy and competitiveness of Harrell, and the Clips have two great young players in Zubac and Shamet.  Shamet is the closest thing to Curry we've seen yet.  Doc Rivers is still one of the better coaches in the league and will have the respect of Kawhi and PG13.  If I can find an issue that this team may have it would be playmaking, as both of their stars aren't know to create much for others.
3. **Los Angeles Lakers** \- The Clippers and Lakers are now 1A and 1B in Los Angeles. LeBron James and Anthony Davis are arguably the best pair of teammates to ever play together.  People forget about AD.  Anthony Davis is absolutely dominant and I look forward to him reminding people of that this season.  He is unbelievably good, and if you didn't know already, LeBron is still that guy.  They missed out on Kawhi, but they sure made up for it in Free Agency.  The Lakers filled out their roster with the likes of Cousins, Danny Green, Bradley, KCP, Rondo, and McGee, while retaining one of the best young players in the game in Kuzma.  It'll be fun to see how they all play together, but this team looks very strong on paper.  Some sports books in Vegas now have the Lakers as the favorite to win it all.
4. **Milwaukee Bucks** \- Fear the Deer.  While the West has exploded, the Bucks are on top in the East for now.  Milwaukee dominated last season in both the regular season and playoffs.  Reigning MVP Giannis will be even better and their core stayed intact minus Brodgon.  Losing Brogon was a significant hit for them, but they still have Bledsoe and Hill at the PG, and they picked up Wesley Matthews which is a sneaky good add.  Khris Middleton continues to make his case as an elite SG, and they retained Brook ""Splash Mountain"" Lopez.  The Bucks also have a great coach and offensive system, to go along with tremendous length on the defensive end.  A number of teams will challenge them in the East next season, but I wouldn't underestimate the Bucks in the East while the West dukes it out with each other.
5. **Philadelphia 76ers** \- Philly has a mind-boggling starting 5 now.  Simmons, Richardson, Harris, Horford, Embiid.  Here is the height of their starting lineup:  6'10, 6'6, 6'9, 6'10, 7'0.  Yikes.  Reddick (and Butler) were losses for them, but Richardson is a major improvement at SG (way better defender, still a very good shooter), and the addition of Horford is amazing.  Al Horford is one of the best overall players in the league and surely underrated, both on the court and in the locker room.  This team will be a problem, but it will have to be seen how they mesh together.  Their bench is questionable to say the least.  I guess Mike Scott is the 6th best player now.  I'm not sold on the Sixers just yet, but their starting 5 is probably the best in the league.
6. **Utah Jazz** \- The Jazz, like the Nuggets, are being slept on by most of the national media.  They were the #1 defensive team in the league last season.  They struggled on offense in the playoffs when Mitchell was the sole option on most plays.  Adding Conley is the absolute nut add for this team.  Conley adds another offensive weapon and clutch performer to relieve Mitchell of playmaking duties down the stretch.  He is also an elite individual defender and a good culture guy that will fit right in.  I like Rubio, too, but Conley fits so much better with this group, I was really happy to see him go to Utah.  Aside from Conley, they are well coached and know how to move the ball.  Joe Ingles is an underrated SF who will be better when he can kick out to Conley instead of Rubio to space the floor.  These guys are young too and have real chemistry.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Stifle Tower and Co. secure a 3rd or 4th seed in the West.
7. **Houston Rockets** \- Westbrook to the Rockets, Wow!  It's an amazing time to be an NBA fan.  Following this FA has been crazy, I can't think of a time when so many teams were loading up.  I can't wait to see how this team will mesh, but I'm not quite sold yet that they will.  Westbrook and Harden were the #1 and #2 highest usage % players in the league the last 5 seasons.  Something has to give.  Harden had almost 0 assisted field goals last year, and Westbrook is not a good spot up shooter.  They will have to change their style, but I am excited to see how it works.  They still have a very good young center in Capela, and a dark horse 6th man of the year candidate in Eric Gordon.  I'd like to see Westbrook pushing the pace up the floor and running with Capela, with Harden getting the ball later in the shot clock.  We will see if Harden can adapt his game to play more SG and move without the ball... something he has been notorious for not doing.  Regardless, the Rockets will have two MVPs now who are hungry for success.
8. **Golden State Warriors** \- Maybe I'm sleeping on the Warriors, or maybe the NBA is just that stacked.  The Warriors lost Kevin Durant, but they still have Curry, Klay, and Draymond.  Plus they've added Russell and solid backups in Burks and Cauley-Stein.  The Warriors should absolutely still be in the mix, and if they are, Curry has a very good shot at MVP.  It will be interesting to see how well Kerr coaches this team and adjusts to these changes.  D-Lo is someone I never imagined on the Warriors, but I guess I didn't envision Durant or Cousins joining them, either.  One thing for sure is he is one of the best young players in the league and should be on his best behavior with the Warriors.  I am higher on Cauley-Stein than most, and Draymond should be a good mentor for him.  Their bench is questionable (though it has been) and Klay will be out for the first part of the season.
9. **Portland Trail Blazers** \- Dame and McCollum showed last season that they are definitely in the discussion for the best back court in the league.  Unfortunately for them, Nurkic was out during their playoff run.  Those guys are all in their primes and have a wealth of experience together.  Portland got rid of their long wings in Harkless and Aminu, but they added much needed scoring and defensive presence on the wing in Kent Bazemore.  I also like their pick up of Mario Hezonja, a talented player that hasn't had much of a shot in the league so far.  Lastly, they acquired Hassan Whiteside which would have been more of a blockbuster move a couple years ago, but even now it is a significant addition.  Whiteside should be on his best behavior in Portland where he even knows that he's not the best player on the team.  The Blazers are very good and should fight for 50+ wins next season.
10. **Boston Celtics** \- Boston is under the radar once again, just where they want to be.  While Kemba isn't exactly an upgrade over Kyrie, he should be a superior compliment to this team as an All-NBA PG without any drama/leadership issues.  Kemba should fit Boston's offense perfectly; he is an excellent catch-and-shoot player and extremely fast with the ball.  Losing Horford is significant, I would have Boston higher if they still held on to Al.  With that being said, Kanter is a decent pick up (they needed rebounding) and probably a better team defender then he gets credit for. Hayward should have a much better year this time around, as well as Tatum and Brown.  Locker room chemistry is vital - especially for young guys - and they just didn't have it last season.  Brad Stevens is still one of the best coaches in the NBA. Players should buy into his system 100% this season, I fully expect Boston to be top 4 in the East.
11. **Brooklyn Nets** \- Brooklyn already had many young, talented players (Dinwiddie, Harris, LeVert, Allen) before adding Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  Not to mention Taurean Prince (underrated signing) and DeAndre Jordan (overrated signing).  They are well coached and will compete with anyone.  If Durant wasn't injured for the year, the Nets could be the best team in the East.  Even without Durant, however, this team will be very good.  I can't see Kyrie having the same kind of negative effect on this team as he did in Boston... but who knows.  Irving is a superstar PG that will have very good shooters around him and a young big man in Jarrett Allen with all the promise in the world.  When D-Lo was injured, Dinwiddie stepped up and was the best player on the team for a stretch of time.  The Nets will definitely make the playoffs, and if KD can come back during that time they have a real shot at making it to the Finals.
12. **Indiana Pacers** \- I love the way this team has re-tooled.  The Pacers were very good the last couple of years, even when Oladipo was out.  They are tenacious on defense and play well together offensively.  Indiana almost made a real run in the playoffs when Oladipo was healthy.  They lost Bogan Bogdanovic which hurts, but they picked up TJ Warren to replace him.  Malcolm Brogdon joined this team which creates a formidable backcourt alongside Oladipo.  I absolutely love Sabonis, and Myles Turner is set to have a career year next season.  Another underrated signing is Jeremy Lamb who was arguably the Hornet's best young player after Kemba left.  I may even be underestimating on this projection, but Oladipo will be out at the beginning of the season and it will take some time to build chemistry with so many new faces.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Indiana take as high as a 3 seed in the East.
13. **San Antonio Spurs** \- Death, Taxes, and the Spurs making the playoffs.  While the West this year is absolutely bonkers, I believe the 8 seed is up for grabs between teams like the Spurs, Mavericks, Kings, and maybe Pelicans.  The Spurs were bad defensively (by their standards) last year and they still took the Nuggets to 7 games in the first round.  They will be much better on that end this year as  Dejounte Murray is fully healthy, Derrick White is an absolute menace (the Spurs never disappoint when it comes to developing young guys like White), and the best player in the Summer League, Lonnie Walker IV, becoming a rotational player and defensive stopper.  The NBA is stacked with powerful duos now, and the Spurs still have one in Demar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge.  Marcus Morris would've been a great fit, but picking up Carroll and Lyles (possibly) are good additions as well.
14. **Dallas Mavericks** \- The Mavs are one of the teams that I'm most excited about.  They are extremely well coached  and surprisingly deep.  Porzingis has been injured, but look for him to be a top 15 player next season.  7'3 with a high basketball IQ and excellent shooting touch.  Doncic had one of the best rookie campaigns ever and I expect him to improve upon that after a full year of conditioning, NBA training, etc.  Aside from these two, they picked up Delon Wright (super underrating signing) to play PG and to play defense.  Brunson was great on offense, but between him and Luka the Mavs got scorched.  Tim Hardaway Jr. is the perfect third option on this team, and they also have Justin Jackson and Seth Curry.  The Mavs also resigned both of their young &amp; athletic centers.  This team has filled out nicely and it will be fun to watch Doncic and Porzingis under Rick Carlisle.
15. **New Orleans Pelicans** \- What rebuild?  New Orleans traded the best player they've ever had for a haul of young talent and draft picks, plus lucked out on the #1 draft pick that turned into Zion Williamson.  This team will be good right away.  Lonzo Ball and Jrue Holiday instantly become a lock down defensive back court.  Lonzo should do better on this team away from the spotlight of L.A.  Jrue Holiday is one of the best guards in the game and should be the leader from day 1.  Brandom Ingram should average 20+ PPG this season and cement himself as one of the premier scoring threats in the league.  They also have a lot of shooting in Redick, Hart, Moore, and Miller.  Derrick Favors was another good signing, and Okafor showed signs of life recently.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if this team makes some noise right away and fights for a playoff spot.
16. **Toronto Raptors** \- The defending champions lost both Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.  Still, the rest of their championship core is intact (Lowry, VanVleet, Powell, Siakam, Gasol, Ibaka).  They play well together and have one of the better coaches in the NBA.  While most of the NBA will have to figure out chemistry on the fly, the Raptors already have their continuity.  Of course a team without Kawhi is going to be worse, but the Raptors are still formidable and will make the playoffs next season.  They played well in the games he didn't play last season, and bottom line is that this group knows how to win and play together.  Aging veterans Lowry and Gasol definitely have some left in the tank, and I look for Siakam to take another step and cement himself as the best player on the team.
17. **Sacramento Kings** \- Another sneaky young team who can make some noise this year is the Kings.  De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield make up a young &amp; formidable back court that's gotten better each season.  Buddy Hield shot 43% from 3 last season at around 5 attempts per game, and Fox has a tremendous feel for the game for such a young player, not to mention his quickness and athleticism.  One move that seemed to go under the radar is signing Dewayne Dedmon.  He is a very good center who is still only 29 years old and surely an upgrade from Cauley-Stein.  They resigned Harrison Barnes (meh), still have Bogdon Bogdonovic, picked up Trevor Ariza, and have one of the best young prospects in Marvin Bagley III.  They will be competitive on any given night; we will see how things come together under new head coach Luke Walton.
18. **Phoenix Suns** \- I am higher on the new-look Suns than most.  They have reshaped their roster (and coaching staff) tremendously despite some questionable draft moves.  First of all, Monty Williams is a game changer from a coaching standpoint.  Next, Ricky Rubio was the perfect addition to their team.  He is the ideal PG to play alongside Booker and to set up Ayton and other shooters, plus he is a good defender with size that will help Booker on that end as well.  The Kelly Oubre signing was critical.  He is only 23 years old and a much better of a basketball player than people give him credit for, plus his locker room presence has been crucial in bringing these young guys together.  Mikal Bridges was a steal in last year's draft, and Dario Saric was added as the ideal 4 to play along side Ayton.  Lastly, Aron Baynes as the backup C has been another underrated pickup.  Most importantly, Devin Booker is the best player in the league under 22 years old.  The Suns have real promise now, even if they won't make the playoffs next season.
19. **Miami Heat** \- Josh Richardson is gone, Jimmy Butler is in.  Whiteside is out which solidifies Bam Adebayo's spot as the starting center.  Even though Richardson is a nice young player, Jimmy Butler is definitely an upgrade.  He should flourish in the role of top dog and his competitiveness will be a welcome sight to an already scrappy group of guys. They have good players on this team like Dragic, Winslow, Waiters and Johnson.  I really like their draft pick at #13, Tyler Herro.  We'll see if the Heat upgrade again with the likes of CP3 or Beal, but regardless they will be a competitive team that should make the playoffs, even if their overall talent is a bit lacking compared to most of the league.
20. **Orlando Magic** \- Run it back!  The Magic have basically the same roster as last season except for the addition of Aminu.  They were one of the hottest teams to end last season, as well as one of the best defensively.  Orlando is filled with long, athletic defenders.  Nikola Vucevic is  one of the best centers in the game.  Aaron Gordon is interesting; he is an explosive athlete with a lot of talent that just hasn't seemed to put it together yet.  Issac is their prized young player who they've been very careful with.  This team will be tough if Gordon can put it together and they can stay healthy.
21. **Minnesota Timberwolves** \- The Timberwolves have been one of the most hopeful teams in recent years that have surely failed to meet expectations.  Let's not talk about Wiggins, but Karl-Anthony Towns is an absolute monster!  I look for KAT to finally fully take control of this team and dominate on both ends of the floor.  He absolutely has the ability to be in the discussion for Top 10 players, but he isn't yet.  There's not a whole lot else on this team, but i do really love Robert Covington (the perfect 3 and D player), and I like their guards Napier and Okogie.  They took Culver with the #6 pick in the draft who will likely step in and contribute immediately.
22. **Detroit Pistons** \- Blake Griffin played his heart out last season and gained a lot of people's respect.  Andre Drummond is a beast on the boards and has improved defensively every season.  Problem with the Pistons as I see it is a lack of playmaking guards and wings.  Most of their offense is predicated around dumping the ball off to Griffin and having him create every time.  Reggie Jackson is good but wildly inefficient.  I like the pickup of Derrick Rose, and Markieff Morris wasn't bad either.  Hopefully Luke Kennard can have a breakout season and provide some much needed spacing for this team.
23. **Atlanta Hawks** \- The Hawks are a fun team to watch.  Trae Young has brought a new kind of energy to the team and I'm sure it's an exciting time to be a Hawks fan.  They have a lot of young talent in Young, Huerter, and especially Collins.  John Collins is one of my favorite players in the NBA.  Super athletic and competitive, plus he's only 21 years old!  ATL will continue to improve and be a force in the NBA after some time.  Jabari Parker was an interesting pick up, he is much better than most give him credit for and should have the opportunity to show that here.  Lastly, they drafted De'Andre Hunter with the #4 pick in the draft, he should come in and contribute immediately.
24. **Chicago Bulls** \- Another promising young team.  Lauri Markkanen broke records in his rookie season and now he should be fully healthy and ready to go.  They drafted Coby White who may end up to be a very good PG in this league.  Zach LaVine is supremely talented on the offensive end, I look for him to improve on the other end as well as he continues to develop.  The Bulls had some nice pickups recently -- Otto Porter last season (huge), and Tomas Satoransky and Thaddeus Young in the off season.  Satoransky may be the best PG on the team when the season starts, he filled in nicely on the Wizards when Wall was injured and he seems to be the right compliment to LaVine in the back court.
25. **New York Knicks** \- What an off season!  The Knicks signed KD, Irving, and drafted Zion Williamson with the #1 overall pick.  Oh wait... In all seriousness, the Knicks did alright to fill out their roster with the likes of Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Marcus Morris, and Bobby Portis.  Randle should feast on this team.  RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr. is definitely two young players to be excited about.  I also like Allonzo Trier, and Kevin Knox has a high ceiling.  Last but not least, Mitchell Robinson may just lead the league in blocks next year.  The New York Knicks will think they can make the playoffs next season.  We'll see.
26. **Washington Wizards** \- The Wizards are in a tough situation with bloated contracts and specifically John Wall being injured.  With that being said, Bradley Beal is an elite SG and all signs are positive with Wall's progress and recovery.  They also have a solid young center in Thomas Bryant.  I think they should have kept Tomas Satoransky, but they did add some rotational players in CJ Miles and Davis Bertans.  Bertans is one of the purest shooters and hardest working professionals, was sad to see him leave San Antonio but he should do well in Washington.  They drafted Rui Hachimura with the #9 pick and he looks impressive.
27. **Memphis Grizzlies** \- With the #2 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, Memphis Grizzlies select Ja Morant!  This kid may be special.  I was pleased to see him go to the Grizzlies after how professionally they handled breaking up their cornerstones in Conley and Gasol.  Jaren Jackson Jr. is a very good young prospect, I think he will be one of the better players in the league in the coming years.  Outside of these two young guys, you could do worse than Jonas  Valanciunas at center, and I also like Dillon Brooks' game.  The timeline of success for this team should rest on how quick and significant of an impact Morant will have.
28. **Cleveland Cavaliers** \- Annual losers since LeBron left, the Cavs don't have a whole lot going for them.  Kevin Love is still the man on this team, and much of their success will be reliant on Love staying healthy.  Collin Sexton has been good so far and they drafted Darius Garland at #5.  Maybe those two players will become a formidable duo in the back court.  Cedi Osman is a versatile player and an above-average SF.  I've always like Larry Nance Jr. Hope for the Cavs at this point has to be in Sexton and Garland's hands.
29. **Oklahoma City Thunder** \- After losing Paul George and Russell Westbrook, OKC will fall the farthest from contention to bottom dweller.  With that being said, they have a lot of promise with the multitude of first round picks they've acquired and a young prospect named Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.  Chris Paul is likely to be traded, so as it stands this team is pretty thin.   Aside from Shai, Schroder is a decent guard and Danilo Gallinari will become the team's best player.  Steven Adams should have a more dominant impact on the boards.  Sam Presti has always worked magic in the front office, and this season is no different (despite losing PG and Westbrook).
30. **Charlotte Hornets** \- Charlotte lost Kemba and replaced him with Terry Rozier.  I don't hate Rozier but that contract is objectively bad.  Scary Terry is one of the most inefficient players in the league, though I do think he will have a better season this year as the #1 option at PG.  They also lost maybe their best young player in Jeremy Lamb.  Malik Monk should be freed with an unlimited green light on offense.  Plus, maybe we can see more of super-athletic Miles Bridges unlocking his euro step windmill dunk.  Ultimately, the outlook is dire for the Charlotte Hornets; It's ironic that the best player to ever play is the owner of the worst team in the NBA.",0.51,controversial,7/14/19 9:57

Game 3:
Mavericks up 83-71 with 8:30 left. A lot of people claim that the refs took over here and helped guide Wade to victory.
Up to the 3rd quarter Wade had shot 15 free throws. In the 4th quarter, Wade shot only 3 free throws, and only 1 free throw within the 8:30 left. So the two other free throws he shot were before the 12 point lead the Mavs had.

Not to mention with the game score was 97-95 in favor of the Heat with 3 seconds to go and Dirk gets given 2 free throws. So the Mavs were given a chance to tie the game, and Dirk only hit 1 of 2 free throws to make the score 97-96 in favor of the Heat. 

So in actual fact, Wade got no free throws in that 8:30, due to the free throws he recieved being out of desperation and the Mavs hacking to be able to get another shot off. So a total of 0 shooting fouls were called for Wade in the 4th.
___

Game 4:
98-74 win for the Heat. Mavs shot 31% and Wade had 9 free throws. Nothing to talk about really. Mavs completely outplayed.
___
Game 5:
This is the game where Wade goes onto shoot as many free throws as the entire Dallas team. 21-25 went Wade and 21-25 went Dallas. Game went into overtime as well.
Wade had 22 points going into the 4th quarter. Wade scored 17 in the 4th quarter with the last 6 points all coming from jumpers. Even the game tying shot was a jumper to level the game at 93-93 with 2 seconds left. No free throws needed. 7 of Wade's 17 points came from FT's. So he basically maintained his average foul shot per quarter rate in the 4th.

Then in the overtime, the score was 100-99 in favor of the Mavs with 2 seconds left and Wade was given 2 free throws. As many of you know, at the time there was great debate as to whether this was a foul or not. The play involved Harris and Nowitzki both hacking Wade and Nowitzki being called for the foul.

Harris' leg clearly fouling Wade.

Also:

Not to mention Harris grabbed Wade's other hand on the way to the basket. He didn't just slap it, but grabbed it and didn't allow Wade to have shooting motion. That is a foul even in late game situations. Two players hacking and getting a huge amount of contact. On his leg, one arm and pushing on his back. That has to get called even in the dying seconds.

Game 6:
Heat win the championship with a 95-92 win.


**Interesting facts**:

With this all summed up, there are certain other facts.
In this playoff run, Dirk Nowitzki sets a record for must FT's hit during the playoffs shooting 209-229. Wade on the other hand shoots 202-250 with both players playing 23 games in the playoffs that year. For a player who is more of a slasher, Wade only managed to get 21 more free throws? So I guess it really is rigged, right?  

Furthermore, Wade shot 10 and 14 free throws in the first two games, so its not like he just got more free throws the next few games. He was already getting to the line a lot.

The total foul count in the series was 146 fouls commited by the Miami Heat and 160 fouls commited by the Mavericks. Fairly equal if anything. Furthermore, it's amazing it was soo close considering the Heat have Shaq and Wade on their team. Wade is a driver who gets a lot of free throws anyway, and Shaq is a guy who teams love to send to the line. Also, the Mavericks were more of a jumpshooting teams, with most of their driving coming from Harris and Howard.

**Quick facts**:


Miami outrebounded the Mavs in 4 of the 6 games in the series.
In the 4 games Miami won, they shot better in 3 of those matchups, with the only time they shot worse being by .8 of a %.
Miami shot less threes then the Dallas team in 5 of the 6 games. The one time they shot more threes then the Dallas team, they lost.


So just for you doubters, hopefully you come through and realize that the NBA is not out to make one team win and one team lose.

325,"What LeBron James gets wrong (about the NFL's slave mentality, and about crowning himself as the GOAT)",11,abjduo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/abjduo/what_lebron_james_gets_wrong_about_the_nfls_slave/,48,1546388611,"Ever since moving to Los Angeles full time, LeBron James has been making headlines for his stellar play and some questionable comments. Let's ignore the rap lyrics (because even as a Jewish person, I couldn't care less) and focus on the more substantive debates.
 
**The NFL owners have a ""slave mentality""**
 
The comments: *""In the NFL they got a bunch of old white men owning teams, and they got that slave mentality.' And it's like, 'This is my team. You do what the fuck I tell y'all to do or we get rid of y'all.' ""*

I don’t like using the slavery comparison because it betrays the gravity of those moral crimes, but there’s definitely some truth to this if you take that as exaggeration for emphasis. NFL players have FAR less power than NBA players. They're treated worse. They don't have full guaranteed contracts. In contrast, NBA players are treated like kings.
 
But what LeBron James either misses or excludes here is the reason *why.*
 
He implies (not directly said) that one reason for this disparity is the leadership of the two leagues -- both in the commissioner's office, and among the player union and leadership. As he explains:
 
*""[Adam Silver] doesn't mind us having... a real feeling and to be able to express that. It doesn't even matter if Adam agrees with what we are saying, he at least wants to hear us out.""*
 
Again, the implication here is that the difference in treatment is partly due to a difference in mentality and leadership. LeBron James has always been a champion of player empowerment, and he deserves credit for that. Under his leadership (formal or informal), NBA players have taken a much more active role in the direction of their teams and their careers.
 
However, there's a fundamental difference between NBA players and NFL players. Simply put, **NBA players matter more.**
 
Part of this is simple math. An NBA player is 1/5 of the starting lineup. An NFL player is 1/22 (if you include offense and defense.) By that basis alone, the NBA player has a more serious impact on the game result. An NFL quarterback is arguably even more important, but that's a single position. A great NBA player can have a phenomenal impact from any position on the court, largely because they can control the flow on offense and will still play a role on defense as well.
 
Do you know what athlete is the *most* empowered? Floyd Mayweather Jr. Because, after all, he’s 1 of 1. Mayweather can make $100M+ dollars for a fight. Even beyond that (because the pay-per-view aspect skews the money), he can control the event, the time, the venue, the preliminary matches, etc, down to every last detail. He doesn’t need a full league or a tournament - he needs one other guy to beat. He effectively produces the show himself. There may have been a time when superstar boxers like Mike Tyson got taken advantage of, but Mayweather realizes his value and the power and influence he can yield. As you expand the numbers in team sports, you naturally get less and less impactful on the results of the match. 
 
In a sport with 22 starters and 52 man rosters, the impact and power dynamics are entirely different. The NFL realizes that none of their players (save quarterbacks) matter much at all. That can be good or bad. It's good in the sense that the Kansas City Chiefs can cut a bad egg like Kareem Hunt: knowing full well that they can replace him easily. Arguably, it's bad because they can ostracize players like Colin Kaepernick. If you're not a stud QB, you don't matter much.
 
The other reason that NBA players have more power than NFL players is the **injury factor** (and shelf-life factor.) An NFL player who's great at 24 years old may very well be over the hill by age 28. That's far less true of the NBA. There may be injuries here and there, but we can generally expect someone like Giannis Antetokounmpo to be a good player for the next 3-4 years at least.
 
In the NFL, the specter of injuries looms much larger and affects far more players. The reason their contracts are not fully guaranteed is for this specific reason. They can't predict who's going to be healthy next year, and thus can't commit a bunch of their cap space in the process. If they did (and had to guarantee a contract for the life of the deal), they may not have enough healthy bodies to fill out a roster.
 
The fact that the NFL/NCAA requires football players to stay on campus for 3 full seasons also exacerbates that concern. A lot of players *enter* the NFL with wear and tear on their bodies. In the NBA, teams love young players on rookie deals because they know they'll be affordable -- and will rocket up in price afterwards. In the NFL, teams love young players on rookie deals because they know that their career may be *finished* by the time the deal ends.
 
Another huge factor is the degree of **coaching involvement.** In the NBA, coaches do call some plays and run some systems, but not nearly to the level that NFL coaches do. NFL coordinators are calling 100% of the plays on the field (and coordinators calling defenses against those plays.) The Xs-and-Os is a giant chess match, of which the coaches/coordinators play a huge role. We can see recently how young quarterbacks like Jared Goff, or Mitchell Trubisky, or even Patrick Mahomes have thrived thanks in part to bright offensive coaches.
 
The importance of NFL coaching and offensive/defensive system also contributes to a feeling that players matter less (than NBA players.) Partly as a result of that (and other factors we mentioned), NFL free agency is not nearly as important as NBA free agency. NFL teams can't be sure if a certain player will succeed in their particular system and for their particular coach. Nnamdi Asomugha was the world's top cornerback in Oakland, only to underwhelm in Philadelphia's system. We don't hear nearly as much concern like that in the NBA. Perhaps the closest was some murmurs that Kawhi Leonard may be worse outside of Gregg Popovich's system in San Antonio but -- as it turns out -- it didn't matter much at all.
 
Certainly, coaching matters in the NBA to some degree, but it matters *less.* And as a result, it reinforces the point that NBA players matter *more.* Conversely, NFL coaching matters more -- so players matter less. Tom Brady may be the greatest QB of all-time, but he arguably matters less than his own coach. You would never think that in the NBA.
 
Given that, it's easier to understand the power dynamics of the sports. In the NFL, coaches can loom over players, while the opposite is true in the NBA. As a result, NBA franchises need to do everything in their power to keep their stars happy, or go out of their way to sweet talk and recruit new ones into the fold. They kowtow to players -- not out of kindness or liberal leanings, but out of necessity. That deference flows through to the unions and CBAs as well.
 
Again, there's some truth to what LeBron James is saying. NFL owners are indeed older, more white, and more politically conservative (with wealth more often inherited). And, NFL players are indeed treated worse than NBA players. But those two are not inherently linked. 
 
Simply, NFL players are treated worse because they matter less. That's not a mentality; that's a reality.
 
**The greatest of all time**

The comments: *I was super, super ecstatic to win one for Cleveland because of the 52-year [championship] drought. And then after I stopped, I was like, that one right there made you the greatest player of all time.*
 
First of all, I hate judging a current player against a retired one, because we're only partly through the process. That'd be like me watching *A Star is Born* and then standing and screaming ""This is the best movie of the year!"" in the middle of the second act. Relax. We have plenty of time for those discussions later on.
 
When the dust is settled on LeBron James' career, he may very well be the greatest basketball player of all time. But to me, his greatest argument is his consistency and **longevity.** James averaged 27-7-7 by Year 2, and may very well be doing the same through Year 22. *That's* his best path to being the GOAT. The guy is a basketball machine – which stands in contrast to Michael Jordan who did take some time off (on an earnest baseball journey or on a secret suspension, depending on how much of a conspiracy theorist you are.) James didn't skip a beat. He kept playing, over and over and over, and ruled his sport over and over and over. That's a legitimate argument in his favor.
 
What James (and James defenders) should not fall into is a: ""ringgzzz"" argument. Nor should they. As mentioned in the section above, a basketball player can have an enormous impact on a game (compared to a football player.) That said, they're not boxers. They're not playing 1 on 1. They're playing 5 on 5. And those variables add more complexity to the argument than the simple:
""rings = greatness"" argument.

But rather than acknowledge the silliness there, James decided to embrace the ring narrative and simply move the goal posts to suggest that his title should be worth double (or triple? Or 4x?). Personally, I'd take issue with the idea that James' ring in Cleveland is fundamentally different than all championships in the past. The city of Cleveland had a long title drought (ignoring *Major League*), but MOST cities don't win championships. MOST franchises do not have a storied history of success. In a league with 30 teams, not everyone gets a trophy at the end of the year. Losing is the norm.
 
And that losing reputation can often change in a hurry. The New England Patriots didn't have much success as a franchise before Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. The Chicago Bulls didn't have much success before Michael Jordan. Golden State fans were booing their owner a few years before they became a dynasty. You're only a rotten franchise -- until you aren't.
 
I can see an argument that LeBron James' title in Cleveland should be given heavy bonus points if he built it organically. If he turned around a team on the bottom and lifted it to the title slowly but surely until they got over the hump (a la Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas, or alternate dimension Kevin Durant in OKC.)
 
But we have to remember what actually happened. LeBron James left Cleveland, and only returned when they won the NBA Draft lottery and the # 1 pick -- not once, not twice, but three times. As a result, they managed to have a roster with Kyrie Irving and picks that would translate into Kevin Love. We're talking about two All-Star caliber players who were both in their primes.
 
With Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and LeBron James, the deck was not stacked against the Cleveland Cavaliers. They were, by far, the favorite to come out of the Eastern Conference. Their team was title worthy, and would have won 2-3 championships if a Golden State super team didn't emerge out of nowhere.
 
To be fair, LeBron James' comments were not only about the drought, but also about that opponent. As he mentioned:
 
*""Everybody was just talking -- how [the Warriors] were the greatest team of all time, like it was the greatest team ever assembled. And for us to come back, you know, the way we came back in that fashion, I was like, ‘you did something special.*
 
Absolutely, I agree with James there. To beat a 73-win team was incredible, especially in the manner that they did it.
 
That said, I'd take a slight issue here. **Regular season win totals do not automatically equate to your greatness as a team.** We've seen time and time again (especially lately), that the playoffs are an entirely different animal. If season wins and point differential were the be-all and end-all, the Toronto Raptors would have multiple Finals appearances by now.
 
As the Kyle Lowry-DeMar DeRozan Raptors proved, some teams are better in the regular season, and some are better in the playoffs. LeBron James' teams (thanks to him) have routinely been better in the playoffs than the regular season.
 
The point here is that: *that* Warriors team (with Harrison Barnes) was not the greatest team ever assembled, nor playing that way in big games. They had previously won the title, but did that against an injury-riddled Cleveland team (that they still only beat 4-2.) They barely squeaked by Oklahoma City 4-3 to make the Finals. For whatever reason, those Golden State teams were better in the regular season than the playoffs. They were not an unstoppable force at all. The Cavs winning that series was an upset, but not wholly different than the times LeBron James got upset himself.
 
Meanwhile, the new Warriors are indeed a juggernaut. The Kevin Durant + Warriors teams had worse regular season records than the pre-KD Warriors, but have a higher ceiling and thus a more unbeatable aura when they turn on the gas in the playoffs. They have won 8 playoff series, and lost a total of 6 games while doing so (going 32-6.) They cut their playoff losses by more than half. If LeBron James' team had beaten *this* version of the Golden State Warriors, I'd acknowledge that it may be the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to the GOAT debate. But to me, the victory over the 73-win Golden State Warriors was -- while hugely impressively – does not lead James to surpass Michael Jordan.

It may happen one day. But not today. And not because of one title in Cleveland. He will need to keep that power button on and keep that motor running, because he still has more work to do.
 
**greatness but not beyond reproach**
 
I understand that someone who just wrote 1000+ words criticizing LeBron James may classify as a ""hater,"" but that's not my intention. I'm not a die-hard fan of any particular team or any particular player (hence the lack of flair.)
 
In fact, I happen to be a huge admirer of LeBron James as a human being. He handles his business (literally, his business) in exceptional fashion. He appears to be a great husband and father. He's a willing and engaged advocate for social and political change. He's doing all the right things. His heart is in the right place.
 
That said, that doesn't make him beyond criticism. I firmly believe that you can criticize your friends, your family members, or your favorite players when you happen to disagree with them. And in these two particular instances, I happen to disagree with James.",0.53,controversial,1/1/19 16:23
326,[Unpopular Opinion] Curry/Kd/Harden in place of Lebron would have made the finals last year as well,6,ax8fdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ax8fdf/unpopular_opinion_currykdharden_in_place_of/,76,1551742679,"Some people believe that Lebron is still the best because of last year's playoff run. I've seen countless comments saying only he could have dragged them to the finals, Kd/curry would have lost in the 1st round against Indiana, etc. 

To me that's ridiculous. So you complain GSW ruined the league by being too stacked with 2 MVPs and 2 other stars, but then say those same MVPs would not be able to get past a Victor Oladipo-led team (who had multiple bad games in that series) or a Tatum/Horford led team? If lesser players such as Iverson, Kidd, and Dwight all were able to carry weak supporting casts out of the East, do you really think Curry or Kd couldn't? 

Toronto wouldn't be much of a problem seeing as how they always fold. Boston would be tough, but I don't understand why the same people who say the 2015 finals doesn't count because Kyrie and Love were injured, are saying winning the ECF is so legendary and impressive when Boston was also missing Kyrie and Hayward.

And honestly after seeing Harden carry a team of G-leaguers from 14th to 3rd seed, I think he could too. Yes he folded against the spurs in 17 and was not perfect in the 18 WCF but the spurs and warriors were both lightyears ahead of Indiana/Toronto/Boston in terms of talent, coaching and defensive schemes, which helped stifle him a bit.

Downvote me if you want, but I really think the claim that ""Lebron is the best because only he can carry bad teams to the finals"" is not true. I truly believe Kd or curry in place of Lebron on the cavs would have made the finals in 2018. Harden might not be as likely but still has an excellent chance, no way I see these 3 losing against Indiana or Toronto.",0.53,controversial,3/4/19 15:37
327,The Hard Truth: Harden's movements explained.,785,8cpzm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8cpzm1/the_hard_truth_hardens_movements_explained/,542,1523933578,"Hey folks! :) the reason for making this is goes as follows:

&nbsp;

Yesterday a video was posted that garnered a lot of attention; I will withhold the users name out of respect but he claimed that, the move that Harden did against Andrew Wiggins, which he termed was ""a blatant travel becoming Harden's signature move"". So, naturally, I made me reply in defense of the move - which then wasn't received so nicely at the time.

&nbsp;

I understand what people might have been feeling, it's a playoff game - refs have been the bane of a few viewers, or - they just hate the fact that ""James Harden always travels and gets away with it"". Listen, I understand the frustration and it's all reasonable in one way or another.

&nbsp;

I want to note that, 1. I am **NOT** a Houston Rockets fan - nor am I **FAN** of James Harden. I like guy, he's good, but, for me, I'm a fan of the sport more-so than a team or a player. So hopefully, by you all taking some time to digest the following explanation - it will better help you understand Harden's dribble mechanic and his excellent use of footwork.


&nbsp;


I will now explain some common rules - this, by no means is to insult or degrade anyone reading; it's just to add some context and support behind my explanation.

&nbsp;

**Official NBA Rule Book:**

&nbsp;

**Section VII pg. 19: Pivot**

> A pivot takes place when a player, who is holding the ball, steps once or more than once in any direction with the same foot, with the other foot (pivot foot) in contact with the floor.

> If the player wishes to dribble after a pivot, the ball must be out of his hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor. If the player raises his pivot off the floor, he must pass or attempt a field goal before the foot is returned to the floor.

> If he fails to follow these guidelines, he has committed a traveling violation.

&nbsp;

**Section XIII pg. 37: Traveling**

> B. A player who comes to a stop on step one when both feet are on the floor or touch the floor simultaneously may pivot using either foot as his pivot. If he jumps with both feet he must release the ball before either foot touches the floor.

> H. Upon ending his dribble or gaining control of the ball, a player may not touch floor consecutively with the same foot (hop).


&nbsp;

There are about 15 separate rules that explain different types of ""travels""; that is not taking into consideration the plethora of rules that distinguish what dribbles are as well as other rules that may in-fact offset already set and established rules– I mean, it’s insane. I have a whole new perspective and respect for referees after just SKIMMING the rule book. Anyways, in this case, these two rules mentioned above are crucial and reflect the James Harden play, and if misunderstood incorrectly - would deem his move a travel.

&nbsp;

Also, shootout to /u/abumaju – I had to google the definition for “gather step”; not that I didn’t know what it was, but I couldn’t find it in the rule book – and he had a post from 2013 that explained why 3 steps were deemed “legal”.

&nbsp;

**Gather Step** - [You're allowed 2 steps upon completion of a dribble, so if you dribble while pushing off of one foot it is not counted toward one of your 2 allowed steps.]( https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1lyyr3/explanation_of_why_3_steps_is_actually_legal/)

&nbsp;

Alright, now that we have rules out of the way – lets discuss replays.

&nbsp;

This is a topic that’s very prevalent within the NFL – especially after BIG HITS. In the NFL, when you slow down a play it looks WAY more vicious than it does when actually watching it. This is a concern that I have with NFL fans calling every other slow-motion tackle a “dirty hit”. The game of football is fast paced, so when an action occurs it may or may not seem that big until you slow it down.

&nbsp;

THIS, however, is the opposite in basketball.

&nbsp;

Basketball is a fast-paced sport, and you have to take into account many different things, I mean, just look at the damn NBA Rulebook – would I want to be a ref after reading that thing? HELL NO!

&nbsp;

When you watch a play in live action, as opposed to football, the move may look illegal, because you can’t see everything that’s going on. Basketball players are so quick with their footwork that every other Harden euro-step, or Lebron James drive to the rim is called a foul. However, when you slow it down, it is THEN when you break down the play that you see what **actually** happened.

&nbsp;

Now, all of that aside, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of this ordeal.

&nbsp;

[This was the video that everyone was up in arms about – and, rightfully so.]( https://streamable.com/ikkia)

&nbsp;

/u/sims888 – hands down one of the best memers and contributors on the subreddit [sent me this picture asking if it was a gather step.]( https://imgur.com/40k2l8j)

&nbsp;

When woke up to that message and saw that picture, I was like “woah, okay, that looks really bad”, not because it was a genuine question. But because it appears Harden has both feet on the ground – and then he would have to take a few more steps to get behind the 3 point line to shoot the ball. Which, to anyone who would see that pic – would call his play a travel.

&nbsp;

**BREAKING DOWN THE PLAY**:

[James Harden activating the crossover on Andrew Wiggins]( https://imgur.com/hYK12ZR)
* Here we see Harden attempting what appears to be a crossover. His body is leaned forward, right leg extended and holding his position, while his left leg is jabbing towards the ground.

&nbsp;

[James Harden closing in]( https://imgur.com/qLUvxfp)
* What we see here, is Harden dribbling the ball, legally closing the distance – bringing his body closer together and placing tons of bodyweight on his left leg.

&nbsp; 

[James Harden beginning to activate his “signature move”]( https://imgur.com/Ku1m85k)
* Harden, still in the act of dribbling, sizes up Wiggins – slowly starting to use the energy he placed on his left leg with his body weight in the picture above.

[Harden 6](https://imgur.com/LfYO3Gb)

&nbsp;

[Harden 7: Note: these movements are happening within SECONDS](https://imgur.com/aj8FKMM)

&nbsp;

Okay, so what is Harden doing here? He is using the force that he placed on his left leg and is now proceeding to take Wiggins off balance and create distance between the two.
[Within ONE SECOND Harden has a victim. Wiggins is off balance, he has no way to recover, so Harden is now beginning to release his left leg – to create distance](https://imgur.com/AeYevIQ)

&nbsp;

Okay, here is where we take a moment and admire Harden’s agile footwork, the whole play was derived from placing weight on that left leg – however, if you’re into boxing, you would know that your “jab leg” in this case is ALWAYS supported by the leg that is behind it; THAT is where your power comes from – and in this case, is what Harden used to not only create an impressive amount of distance – but do so – so quickly and fluidly that his left leg APPEARED to be on the ground but was only INCHES away from touching it. If this man was a boxer – he would be something else based off his ability to move so effortlessly on the court.

&nbsp;

[Harden’s back leg now raising, activating his calves, thighs, and glutes – his left leg is suspended in air, hence the shadow.](https://imgur.com/52D5zWj)

&nbsp;

Harden *“tip-toeing in his Adidas”* lol. I am not one to fan boy – but this man, within SECONDS, [has now created so much distance that Wiggins is out of frame, left leg in air – and appears to look as if he would jump to take the shot RIGHT THERE: which, he could.](https://imgur.com/VC7RFgi)

&nbsp;

Now, Hardens “first step” – or, his legal ability to take two steps after dribbling [came here]( https://imgur.com/18z9Txg)

&nbsp;

Harden now utilizes this and quickly bounces off his left leg, transferring moment and force and then…

&nbsp;

[Bam, both legs hit the ground and we all know what happens next](https://imgur.com/kYrGqhU)

&nbsp;

To conclude, Harden has amazing footwork, his awkward movements are his ace card – defenders don’t know how to guard it – which is why I’m sure people consider him one of the most ungaurdable players in the NBA today.

&nbsp;

I have to say, after breaking this down, I give so much respect to referees, because if it was any average joe nba fan officiating this game – they would have called this move a travel. 

&nbsp;

I can’t speak on other plays, because it took me so long to break down this one – but the guy moves in seconds, he knows the rules, all he is doing is exploiting defenders with his timing to create space for his shot. Hopefully this helped you understand the type of player Harden is; and to know that – not everything is as it seems; which is why breaking down film is extremely crucial in understanding a player and his movements. 

&nbsp;

Alas, I am not trying to convince anyone of anything, but help them realize what happened last night, and that the uproar for this move, justifiably so – to those that just saw it for what it was – was okay, but they were misguided by their eyes.

328,Durant joining the Warriors would be the most Anti-Competitive thing I've ever seen. He and the team would instantly be hated for it.,0,4r5cao,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4r5cao/durant_joining_the_warriors_would_be_the_most/,132,1467632027,"You might have seen [this Durant tweet from 2010](https://twitter.com/kdtrey5/status/18688294600) in which Durant says:

>Now everybody wanna play for the heat and the Lakers? Let's go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!

Frankly, if Durant joins the Warriors it's 10x more anti-competitive than what LeBron did in 2010.   In 2010, the Heat were a 47 win team.  They gutted the roster to make room for LeBron and Bosh.  

Look, I know Michael Beasley didn't go on to much success, but at the time Beasley was a 21 year old who had been recently selected 2nd in the draft and had just come off a season averaging 14.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.3 assist.  The Heat flat out gave him away for a 2nd rounder just to make cap space to sign LeBron and Bosh.  

Consider the teams also ""in the running"" to land Durant this season.  The Boston Celtics are a 48 win team that theoretically could add Al Horford and Kevin Durant without sacrificing any significant pieces.  That's the equivalent of what LeBron did in Miami - joined a 47 win team with another all-star.  His method of doing it was undoubtedly annoying and classless, but what he actually did still had some semblance of competitive spirit.  

On the flip side, Durant joining Golden State this Summer would be one of the most disgraceful things I've ever seen in competitive sports.  They came inches away from being back-to-back champions.  They arguably had the greatest offense we've ever seen.  They are coming off a record-breaking 73 win regular season and came mere seconds away from having a legitimate claim as the greatest team of all-time.  Game 7 was fucking tied with a minute left.  The game was essentially decided by a single FG.

Durant joining a world-beating 73 win team would be the ultimate spineless move.  Steph, Draymond and Clay are all in their 20s and all three of them were All-NBA players this years.  Not to mention, this is the team that just defeated Durant in the playoffs. 

Do not dare compare this to what LeBron did in Miami.  It's not even remotely close.  This would be like if in 2008 after narrowly losing to KG/Pierce/Ray's 66 win Celtics in game 7, LeBron decided to sign with them in the offseason - but only if the aging KG, Pierce and Ray had all been in their mid 20s, in the thick of their prime and a 73 win record-setting team.  

Also, in terms of his legacy, I don't see how this will really benefit him.  Steph is the reigning MVP of the entire league.  Any championships they win will just be adding to Steph's resume.  Wade was a step past his prime by the time LeBron showed up - it was pretty clear LeBron was the main guy there immediately.   That's unlikely to be the case on Golden State.  Really, the only place that team has to go is down.  They are unlikely to win more than 73 games next season even with Durant.  Even if they win the championship, how much credit can Durant really get for it?  

In order for Durant to get credit, Steph and Klay would need to suddenly evolve into side-kicks, Durant would need to lead the team in multiple statistical categories, they'd need to win 80 regular season games and sweep through the playoffs - with Durant winning Finals MVP in the process.  Anything less than that?  He's an anti-competitive bandwagoner.   

I live in Seattle and saw Durant's first home game in person.  I've been rooting for him for a long time.  If he joins the Warriors, I'll lose a lot of respect for him.  Meanwhile, Golden State has been an exceptionally likeable team for two seasons.  I've been rooting for Steph Curry since he was a rookie.  I have an affinity for shooters.  I use to argue with fans about how Monta Ellis was holding back Curry and the kid could be a superstar.   I love that guy...   If Durant joins that team, the Warriors instantly become the league-wide villains.  They become the ""evil empire"".  They become a negative symbol for everyone outside of Golden State.   I can't be alone in this.  Many would see Durant as an anti-competitive puss.   

The irony is that this is possibly the one scenario that could turn previously-despised LeBron James in to an underdog hero.  I can't imagine rooting for that bushleague Golden State team if they clashed with 32 year old LeBron in the Finals.   If LeBron succeeded in defeating them - the act alone would make him arguably the greatest athlete in history.   THAT is how you build a legacy.  

**TL;DR:  Durant joining Golden State would make him the biggest anti-competitive bitch in history.  Fan opinion would instantly turn against both him and that team.  It would be terrible for his legacy.  If they stayed on top, he'd get little credit for it.  If all he cares about is helping another star collect jewelry, he might as well take the league minimum and go help LeBron win another championship**",0.45,controversial,7/4/16 4:33
329,The Suns will not be the worst team in the West,0,caz0ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/caz0ho/the_suns_will_not_be_the_worst_team_in_the_west/,84,1562696341,"Bookmark this now.

&#x200B;

Three years ago the organization decided to embrace the tank and commit to fully rebuilding and building through the draft to accumulate the talent for the next great Suns team.

We on purpose put together extremely young teams with the intention to give young players a chance to develop with playing time while also guaranteeing a high draft pick. The last 2 years r/nba fans and casual Suns fans cried about acquiring any PG but the Suns resisted doing something stupid like trading first round picks for Terry Rozier or making other short-term moves to adress glaring issues.

&#x200B;

**We played the whole season last year without a PG.** 

Canaan was a D-League scrub who brought positive attitude and played hard but has no idea how to run an offense and by metrics was one of the worst players in the league.

Melton flashed defensive potential occasionally but he is 2nd round project that had no idea how to play offense and overall was not good on defense at all. At one point later in the season Booker was so frustrated with Melton that he yelled at Igor during the game to ""put his ass on the bench"".

Okobo also only showed flashes but was far away from being even a serviceable backup.

&#x200B;

**We played the whole last year without a PF.**

Ariza was slacking. Bender got a whole lot of minutes at PF without ever earning them and consistently being one of the worst 10 players in the league since being drafted. So we often played small forwards at PF that were nowhere near ready to hold their own against power forwards.

&#x200B;

**We kept playing ""low floor - high potential"" scrubs major minutes hoping for it to click since we had nothing to lose.**

We kept giving major minutes to Josh Jackson hoping it would finally click for him despite him being one of the worst 10 players in the league and he gave us nothing but occasional flashes. His boneheaded decision making cost us several possessions per game just by himself. Anyone who follows the NBA knows how killer it is to have two completely unnecessary turnovers, charges or running into low percentage layups or getting blocked.

Josh Jackson got his layups blocked at least once per game.

Many people always described him as a defender, but he was absolutely awful at actually playing defense and consistently lost his man.

One of the biggest flaw is that players like Josh Jackson played like they were trying to be the next Tracy McGrady but the Suns do not even have room for that. We already have our star players in Ayton and Booker. We can't afford a 20 year old out there trying to go from scrub to star. We needed players who accept their role as role players first of all and do that job first.

&#x200B;

**We had a coach whose system was completely opposed to the strength of the players he was working with.**

Igor was a horrendous coach. Even though he initially claimed to build a system around his players he had set targets for assists and 3pt attempts per game. Despite the Suns being the worst 3pt shooting teams in the NBA he had us shooting a high volume of 3s.

Despite not having a PG he tried to play fast. A young team like that playing fast without a PG is a recipe for disaster when you have players like Jackson who totally kill many possessions. If you run up the total possessions per game the difference between the mistakes a young team makes compared to more veteran solid teams just grows larger and makes it more likely to lose.

&#x200B;

**Losing TJ Warren is unlikely to have much of an effect.**

He was a constant in our worst performing 5-man units. He didn't fit in at all. He does not move the ball. While he is a good slasher off the ball it still never felt like he actually moves off the ball. He miraculously raised his 3pt% but it was still on a low volume and he still never looked like a natural shooter.

He struggled on defense. He was hopeless in playing the 4 defensively.

He constantly injured himself with concussions or other undisclosed mystery injuries.

I can't recount how often he made myself pull my hair out when he committed charging fouls or took low percentage shots when he had an obvious open pass to make.

538 rated him as a scrub. While I personally don't believe that I think his skillset fills a niche that simply was not there on the Suns. We need 3&D players to surround Booker, Ayton and now Rubio. If we kept Warren he was going to get stuck behind Bridges and Oubre.

&#x200B;

**This offseason things have been different.**

&#x200B;

**Addition by Substraction**

James Jones cut away all the negative players. Jackson, Melton and Bender are gone 

&#x200B;

**The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs way**

We brought in a lot of young vets that are maybe not sexy but solid players who can be expected to play hard and do their job.

In the draft James Jones went for 2 players who are expected to be more mature and have well-defined NBA skillsets instead of swinging for the fences with another low floor high ceiling 19 year old who is struggling to find his way. Also he constructed the roster in a way that rookies are not going to be counted on to be rotation players from the start.

Every year you look at the Spurs and Heat roster and you think wow that is a collection of some uninspiring players but most of the time even if you think they have little talent on the roster they end up playing hard and solid and beat teams that seemingly have talent but are inconsistent, immature or whatever.

&#x200B;

**Positional Upgrades and closing gaping holes in the roster**

We upgraded from Richaun Holmes to Aron Baynes. Holmes was nice surprise for the Suns but struggled on the boards and defensively. Baynes is expected to bring more toughness, defense and mentality to the team.

I am not a fan of Saric or Kaminsky but it certainly is a huge upgrade over playing Dragan Bender at the 4 and having nobody else. 

&#x200B;

**Carrying over the attitude shift**

Tyler Johnson and Kelly Oubre made an impact last season already. When everyone was healthy we actually saw improvements already. Tyler Johnson is a solid player, solid defender who plays hard. Kelly Oubre brought a lot to the team as well in terms of mentality and attitude and playing hard.

&#x200B;

**The Young Core - Improvements from Within**

Mikal Bridges had a great rookie season that nobody is talking about. He was as a rookie rated one of the absolute best perimeter defenders in the entire league already.

Booker has gotten better every year in the league. Last year he came into the season with a hand injury and turf toe. Toward the end of the year he was noticeably more explosive, frequently dunking which he did not do much before.

Ayton had a great rookie season and actually was first in most of the advanced stats. He is due to make significant improvement.

Oubre should also be mentioned here.

&#x200B;

**To have a PG or not to have a PG**

Ricky Rubio - while I am not a huge fan of his you can't deny that he will have a huge effect on the Suns. We had no PG last year. There is plenty of precedence for huge W/L improvements that are tied to the acquisition of a PG or improvement at the PG position. Just look at the Kings last year, before the season pretty much nobody thought they had more talent than the Suns but Fox got a lot better and suddenly the Kings performed a lot better despite on paper having less talent. There are plenty examples like Steve Nash signing with the Suns, Kidd to the Nets are probably a lot more where PGs  made significant impacts. While Rubio is not of that caliber going from Canaan to Rubio is probably a more drastic difference than going from Marbury to Nash or from Marbury to Kidd.

As a result Ayton should get more consistent touches.

Booker does not have to bring up the ball all the time and play against elite ball pressure all the time. Last year teams often double teamed him as soon as he crossed half court, some pressured him all the way which sometimes frustrated him and exhausted him.

Hopefully Rubio's passing is contagious. Ayton already showed elite passing ability for a center. Saric is as good a passer as almost any PF. Booker is a good passer. Bridges showed glimpses of passing ability. Hopefully Oubre can develop that part of his game.

&#x200B;

**Potential for Trade Deadline Moves**

This year it is likely that James Jones could commit if a really good player becomes available. The Suns have a huge expiring contract in Tyler Johnson and all their future first round picks to further upgrade the roster if they are somewhat close to the 8th seed.

&#x200B;

**Lineups on Paper**

If you rank the NBA starting lineups by WAR(Wins Above Replacement) the new Suns starting lineup actually ranks 17th in the entire league and that stat probably underestimates them still since they have been on bad or even bad dysfunctional teams.

&#x200B;

Ayton / Baynes

Saric / Kaminsky

Oubre / Bridges / Cam Johnson

Booker / Tyler Johnson / Cam Johnson

Rubio / Carter / Ty Jerome 

&#x200B;

We probably won't run a 10 man rotation. Kaminsky will see minutes at the 4 and 5. Bridges will get minutes at the 2 and 3. Oubre will get minutes at the 3 and 4. Booker will get minutes at the 2 and 1. Tyler Johnson is going to get minutes at the 2 and 1.

Ayton might even see some minutes as the 4 as he played very well against Giannis and Lebron when he was matched up against them defensively all game. In fact if Ayton and Kaminsky share the floor my expectation would be that Ayton covers the 4 and Kaminsky the 5.

&#x200B;

**Important to start off on the right foot and create momentum**

Can they click from the start? This would be important to create excitement in a sleeping fan base.

Chemistry with each other and with the coachin staff could determine their season.

&#x200B;

**The competition**

Everyone talks about how tough the West is but the bottom line is that all Western teams have to play basically the same schedule.

Memphis looks like it will be in the situation that the Suns were the last 3 years where they fully commit to the rebuild and will be playing guys like Josh Jackson. Same could happen in Oklahoma.

The Mavs have a similiar makeup as the Suns with their duo and some solid pieces around them. But I don't think you can look at their roster on paper and think they have a better roster.

The Pelicans are young and will be relying on young players a lot.

The Timberwolves don't look too hot after losing several rotation players in Derrick Rose, Saric and potentially Jones.

The Spurs are probably going to be very solid but they are not a lock like Golden State, Houston, LAC, Portland, Utah, Denver and the Lakers. 

The Spurs are the favorites for the 8th seed but any of the rest of the field except Memphis could have a breakout year and take it from them.

&#x200B;

Tier 1: Golden State, LA Clippers, Houston

Tier 2: Portland, Denver, Lakers, Utah

Tier 3: San Antonio

Tier 4: Phoenix, Dallas, New Orleans, Sacramento, Minnesota, OKC

Tier 5: Memphis

&#x200B;

**Some teams are bound to fall below expectations**

It is possible that Utah never gels with the changes they made. The players they brought in (Conley and Bojan) take a lot more shots than the players they let go (Rubio and Favors). Conley and Mitchell would join a long list of high usage backcourts that never worked out.

It is possible that the Lakers have a similar season to last year.

The Kings might find it hard to sustain their improvement from last year.

Minnesota might fall apart completely.

New Orleans looks like a wild card - why? They rely a lot on young players, a lot of young players who came into the league expecting to be star players. I predict struggles for them getting these guys to gel and buy into their roles.",0.5,controversial,7/9/19 11:19
330,If the Lakers aren't careful they're going to turn into another pre-ASB 2018 Cavs situation,0,c9y3rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c9y3rp/if_the_lakers_arent_careful_theyre_going_to_turn/,50,1562473009,"In 2018 the Cavs started the season with Rose, Wade, LeBron, and Crowder sharing the court together and Kevin Love starting at center. These weren't awful players per se, several of them found success after moving on from the Cavs, but their team had no vision and their skillsets made 0 sense together. They had no clearly defined strengths and started the year as one of the worst offensive and defensive teams in the league. They tried experimenting with lineups (even testing out third stringers like Jose Calderon and Channing Frye) for a few months but eventually decided the damage was already done, gave up, and shipped everyone out at the all star break in a last ditch effort to save the season.

I feel like we're starting to see a similar pattern with the Lakers' last couple signings. I liked the Cook and Green signings but Rondo is fools gold. He still appears to be a good player but every year since he left the Celtics he's been a net negative on the floor. You can't have a ball dominant point guard that plays no defense and ruins spacing. Starting him with LeBron and Cousins is a potentially disastrous combination and I'm genuinely afraid that Rondo will get the nod over Cook/Caruso because of ""experience"" and name recognition. We already know how bad of a fit he is with LeBron. For reference:

LeBron + Caruso lineups: +9.1 in 147 minutes

LeBron + Rondo lineups: -5.4 in 602 minutes

Then there's Cousins. Now unlike Rondo I don't think Cousins is a terrible player but I do think he's going to severely limit the potential of an AD + LeBron combo assuming he starts. What the Lakers should be doing is starting AD at the 5 and centering their offense around the LeBron/Davis PnR. Simply surrounding them with shooting at every position and one more versatile wing defender would result in a devastating offensive team and a pretty solid defensive one. Starting Cousins could screw that all up. He still has a place on the team but it would be best to keep him out of the starting lineup in favor of more shooting. You can't expect for Danny Green to uphold the spacing on his own.

Now with all this said, based on sheer talent alone there's almost no chance that they'll be as bad as that Cavs team unless Rondo starts (I'm only half joking). I just think they're limiting the insane potential of a LeBron/AD PnR in favor of signing household names and it could cost them a championship.",0.49,controversial,7/6/19 21:16

Here, we will take a look at Enes Kanter's performance in the regular season vs. the playoffs, during years in which his teams made the playoffs. (2012, 2016, 2017) **For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that Enes Kanter's nipples are soft outside of playoff basketball. Enes must obviously get aroused during big moments and during the weeks leading up to the playoffs, but this makes it easier to approximate the relationship between hardness and performance.**

##SOFT ENES (reg. season stats/36):

**19.5 PTS**/**12.2 REB**/**0.9 AST**/**0.7 STL**/0.8 BLK/2.5 TOV/**3.6 PF**/**53.9 FG%**/54.8 2PT%/**20.3 3PT%**/**58.3 TS%**

##HARD ENES (playoff stats/36):

18.2 PTS/11.9 REB/0.6 AST/0.4 STL/**1.7 BLK**/**2.0 TOV**/4.8 PF/51.3 FG%/54.8 2PT%/14.3 3PT%/57.1 TS%



Using these advanced statistics, I conclude that Soft Enes is easily better than Hard Enes, being ahead in almost every meaningful statistical category. The only real advantage Hard Enes holds is accumulating over twice as many blocks, which clearly shows that Enes Kanter's platonic arousal invigorates him and his animal instincts fuel him to become a defensive menace in the paint.

**10 Highlights**

This last week Dennis Schroder shot 15-50 and did not make a single 3 pointer in 3 games. He was absolutely shut down vs John Wall. He is going to be a great player and has a shit team around him but still consistency would be nice.

Tyreke Evans has scored at least 20 points every game in November. He is the only reason the Grizzlies are fun to watch right now, and he enters the top 100 for the first time this season. On that note, Mike Conley is free falling. It sucks that I have him this low but he is not playing well at all, and shot 2-12 tonight.

Ben Simmons is the best rookie since LeBron and I would argue as a rookie he is even better.

The Pistons have 3 top 50 players right now and it is well deserved. Getting Avery Bradley has completely changed this team around and Andre Drummond has finally taken the next step (so far).

Kyle Korver basically got himself in tonight with his 4th quarter against the Knicks. Don't know if he keeps it up for the season but the Cavs sure as hell need him right now.

I had Draymond 7th last week and I'm keeping him there. Stats don't tell the whole story with him, I've watched him more and I feel comfortable keeping him there for now but that's his ceiling too.

I will release my top 25 rookies Friday night, but my top 10 right now is Simmons, Tatum, Ball, Kuzma, Markkaken, Collins, Fox, Mitchell, Smith, Brooks

Paul George has scored 79 points the last 2 games. If Westbrook can play at the MVP level he was last year then OKC can take off. 

Kyle Lowry isn't scoring as much as he did last year and has probably declined a bit but he's still a very good player that makes winning plays. 

This is probably as high as Gortat will get this year, but I think his ranking is well deserved right now. I've watched a few Wizards games and I guarantee you take him out of the lineup and things will be off right away.

337,People Hate James Harden,0,ba5v5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ba5v5u/people_hate_james_harden/,112,1554595833,"&#x200B;

It’s the simplest way to explain the events of the past few years. The loss to Curry in 2015 was understandable. The two players had very similar stats, but Steph had served as the offensive engine of a 67-win Warriors team that surprised everyone after a coaching change. Harden did not have the help of a stellar supporting cast led by 2 All-star teammates, the closest approximation, Dwight Howard, missed half the games to injury, but Harden managed to pull a rag-tag bunch of role players featuring Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley and Donatas Motiejunas to the third seed in a very competitive Western Conference by posting a statline of 27.4/5.7/7. In the end, the historic nature of 67 wins and the unknown promise of unplayed fourth quarters denied Harden an MVP despite his shouldering the larger load.

That was understandable. 

Every thing since then is less defensible.

The following season was the last of the Howard years and was defined by an extreme loss of chemistry (despite being the one time in team history that Daryl Morey did not make major rotation changes due to the WCF run… aside from the acquisition of Ty Lawson), the quick hook of McHale, the total inability of JB Bickerstaff to get buy-in from the team, and a defensive video compilation of Harden’s career lowlights. Despite the team difficulties, Harden still showed improvement in his individual stats across the board. While leading the NBA in points and minutes (through 82 games), he posted an incredible 29/6/7.5 statline that had only ever been accomplished by LeBron, MJ, and Oscar Robertson. Unfortunately, due to team turmoil, it led to a disappointing 8th seed. The failure to live up to expectations surely played a role, but the resulting snub from even 3rd String All-NBA was a major statement from voters that they just didn't care for something about James Harden. Lillard, Lowry, and Thompson were all awarded selections despite having statistically inferior seasons by huge margins.

The next season was even worse. Harden set an NBA record for points created, surpassing the totals of Tiny Archibald. Yes. He produced more points for his team in one season *THAN ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA*. Yet the historic feat that everyone remembers from that season was Russell Westbrook’s assault on Wilt’s triple double record and being the first player since the Big O to average one for a season. 

Be honest, now… Did you remember (or even know) that Harden was the NBA record holder for points created? Maybe, maybe not… but the media certainly didn't help bring it to your attention. There was no tracking of it every night on Sportscenter, or graphic in the sidebar, leaving people like myself to scroll through play-by-plays every night to verify how many assists resulted in three points as opposed to two. 

It wasn’t like the record caught anyone off-guard. Harden had been comfortably ahead of pace for most of the season before a late injury-induced swoon made it an incredibly tight finish. You should have paid attention to those last few games as the questions started to arise of if he could actually pull it off as his season averages dipped significantly. It was a really exciting moment. But not a single news outlet paid it a bit of attention aside from TheDreamShake blog - the same people that revealed the early MVP voting results that year by compiling all the voters picks they could get until a large enough majority had been established to safely project the winner (much to the chagrin of the NBA, who attempted to foil it before it spoiled the crown jewel of their new post-Finals awards show).

There was no good reason for the media blackout. They just didn’t want to focus any attention on the pursuit of the record.

Oh well, no big deal. It's not like he was in the middle of an MVP race and they were fawning all over his competition. Wait... No... That’s actually *exactly* what happened. The media literally created a narrative around the significance of the triple double while ignoring **the most prolific offensive season ever**.

And that was simply the prelude to the greatest disrespect of all. Despite winning 55 games and leading his team to the third seed with great efficiency, voters gave the MVP to a guy who led his team to the *10th best record* in the NBA. A meager 6th seed in the playoff bracket. 3 spots lower (in both cases) than the previously lowest MVP finish (In 1988 by one Michael Jeffery Jordan 35/5.5/5.9) from the past 40 years of media voting. 

This complete break in voting standards was utterly unprecedented, but Westbrook’s accomplishment was deemed “historically significant” as it hadn't been done in over 50 years. If you aren't drawing the connections to this year yet, stick around and I’ll point them out.

Last year was finally Harden’s redemption, though, as he finally won the MVP that had twice eluded him. His case was inscrutable. League scoring leader leading his team through injuries to the number one seed and 65 wins with historic point differentials. There was nobody in the Association even coming close to accomplishing what he was doing. But could the sports media bring themselves to simply acknowledge his greatness and the inevitability of his victory? No. Perennial “should-have-been-a-contender” LeBron James was forced into the conversation again after having disappeared from everyone’s radar for the past few seasons. After leading his team through a turbulent year of roster mayhem to the 6th best record in the league, LeBron really had zero place in the conversation aside from ‘being owed one’ for remaining the best player in the league for the past 4 years. Yet there he was, in a supposedly tight MVP race.

Yes, the media was suggesting that 2018 should be the year to give ‘Bron his 5thMVP almost as a form of ‘lifetime achievement’ award instead of honoring Harden’s accomplishments. The narrative was pushed hard in order to create a semblance of a race and avoid an early coronation where pundits could just appreciate the season as it was unfolding. In 2016 there were no qualms with simply appreciating the greatness of what Steph was doing... but when Harden was doing similar things it was time to consider a different James for top individual honors. 

This year Harden has finally seen some appreciation. It only took setting a record of the **only 35-point, 7-assist season in history**, punctuated with the only 40-point monthly average since Wilt and the second longest streak of 30-point games for the pundits to sit up and take notice. It took the most efficient high volume scoring season (over 32 ppg) resulting in breaking MJ’s 1987 record for point per possession to get a little bit of love from some of the press. 

By any standard, Harden is doing historic things. And he has done it efficiently under a tremendous usage rate that was absolutely required of him due to a heavily injured roster. And it has led to winning results as his team is challenging for the 4th best record in the league despite sitting in second-to-last place after a lackluster first couple of months. The narrative is practically too strong to be denied when compared to the one that beat Harden just two years ago. But here we are again, watching the media try desperately to ignore the history and anoint a 24-year old Greek kid who helped an excellently coached and very healthy squad to a 60-win season through an historically weak schedule.

Don’t get me wrong, Giannis has been a remarkable and integral player in his team’s success, but his only significant advantage beyond a better team record is his DPotY-caliber defense… a criteria that has historically been given short shrift in MVP discussions. 

Harden delivered one of the best offensive seasons in history. Because his team absolutely needed him to in order to win. 

And yet still the haters abound. Scoffing at his ability to draw free throws, insulting his playing style as “boring”, “against the spirit of the game”, or even “cheating”. Harping on his much improved defense, and claiming that any number of players “could do the same thing”.

Why do people love to hate James Harden?

This was the largest difference for an MVP in ppg between the regular season and postseason since Moses Malone's 1981-1982 season(7 ppg difference). Moses Malone only played 3 games during the playoffs so it is possible to go back farther than that since that's not exactly a great sample size. 

I just thought this was an interesting factoid.  A lot of people reference Curry's 2016 season as the greatest offensive season of all time. As a season is comprised of both a regular season and postseason, I personally don't feel like I can place that season as the greatest of all time in its totality. I do believe it's one of the top 2-3 offensive regular seasons of all time though.

339,Please stop talking about Hibbert's rebounding,4,22ytcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/22ytcy/please_stop_talking_about_hibberts_rebounding/,26,1397466739,"I honestly can't take another ""Hibbert with 4 rebounds, [random tiny guard] with 6"" snarky nonsense.  Hibbert's rebounding is almost certainly a product of the system, and is definitely not a problem for his team.

Here's [table one](http://imgur.com/OAZoCP2).  I'll try to add it in text as well:

| Month   | GP    | Reb%     | Def Reb%|
|:------|------:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Oct |    2|  49.7% | 69.9%|
| Nov  |14 |  52.8%| 75.6%|   
| Dec |   14|   51.9% | 78.4%|
| Jan|  15 | 53.3%| 78.6%|
|Feb | 12 | 53% | 77.7%|
|Mar|18 | 50.8% | 75.6%|
|Apr| 5| 47.1% | 73.1% |

When the Pacers looked like they would win 70 games, they rebounded at 52.8%.  And when they started to fall apart after the All Star break, they rebounded at...53%.  Their lowest total, 50.8% (I don't think April is a large enough sample size - and their April hasn't been as bad as march) would be top 12 - over the Spurs and Clippers

And, speaking of the Clips, everyone slams Roy for his rebounding while DeAndre is gobbling up boards.  Jordan has taken a huge step this year, and good for him.  But the Clippers *average* a 49.7% rebound rate, below league average.

If Hibbert really sucked at rebounding, his team should give up more than their share of rebounds.  They don't.

Now, in fairness, Hibbert's personal rebounding % nosedived in March, although it was pretty consistent the rest of the year.  This fits what we all knew:  Hibbert, like the rest of the team, had a shitty spring.  But the idea that he sucks because he doesn't get REB on the stat sheet is utterly obtuse.  

The Pacers send any dribble-drives towards Hibbert, who uses his superhuman verticality to contest things.  This means he is facing the wrong direction, arms up.  Good for defense, not for rebounding.  

The real reason why the Pacers have tanked is their offense efficiency has plummeted.  That puts a ton of pressure on the defense, which may have regressed after a historically good start. 


And, while we're at it - one thing that I noticed is the Pacer's drop in pace has mirrored their slump.  If you want the Pacers to run, you don't want Roy grabbing a monster share of the boards.  PG, Lance, George Hill, 2nd Overall Pick Evan Turner (now I'm a sad 76ers fan again) are all good rebounders.  Hibbert is not known for his outlet passing and his handle is...exactly what you'd expect.  If you want to push the pace, would you want Hibbert boarding and tossing to George Hill?  Or just skip the potential problems (steal, bad pass, time wasted) and have a guard grab it?  In fact, if Hibbert read this nonsense and decided to up his rebounds, he could very well hurt the team.

I just can't stand the whole philosophy behind the whole thing. First they move to Brooklyn, which really isn't a big deal seeing as they used to be in NYC anyways, but they come in as cocky as ever, ""claiming"" the city as their own.

Second off they aren't even going to be all that. They're a 4 seed at best, and it's the Eastern Conference. Everyone knew without Dwight they would all be a bunch of spare pieces to the puzzle, but they just won't admit it. They keep stating that they will win a championship in the next three years or something. Please.

Third - I saw a thread a few days ago where a redditor said the Nets were a label, not a team - I couldn't agree more. Most of the people who buy this Nets merch I bet don't even care about the team that much. Yeah the logo looked cool for like a month. Now everyone's flaunting it everywhere. It doesn't help that whenever I see Kris Humphries I see a dumb celeb and not a basketball player.

Granted, there are some players on the team that I like (see - Everyone but Humphries), but they aren't even in the middle of all the hype going around this goddamn team. I haven't heard a single thing about Deron since he secured his place in Brooklyn, or any of the other players for that matter. All I hear is hype. Not ""Oh Deron is working out and really getting fit"" or ""Joe Johnson is determined to work hard this season"" No. Just Prokhorov and Jay-Z being as arrogant as possible.

I honestly can't wait to see them play at MSG for the first time and get whooped. I'm not saying that will definitely happen but I am sure that the start of the season will be very VERY anti-climactic.

3) It’s a better deal than the deadline biggest reason being they didn’t take Hills contract but also kept Kuzma. Now they can chase a 3rd max guy or have space to sign some great role players

|2. James Harden |\+5|This might be a controversial ranking, and he's a controversial player on this sub. Statistically and efficiently, he's doing better than his MVP season last year now. His game is unique, it's caused a lot of discussion, and despite the team's issues he's been stellar and moves up to number 2.|
|3. Giannis Antetokounmpo|same|Shooting 59% from the field with 27/13/6 averages, unstoppable in the paint, a top 3 player.|
|4. Kevin Durant|\-2|KD was my number 1 player at the end of last year and remains in the top 5. Career high in assists per game, shooting efficiency is down from last year but he's still a top 5 player.|
|5. Nikola Jokic|\+5|His shooting efficiency is actually down from last year. But he's taking a more assertive role on offense, 7.4 APG, the Nuggets are winning, and improved defense. He's in the top 5.|
|6. Paul George|\+6|The thread ""is Paul George better than Westbrook"" has come up every day the last week. It looks like he's at his peak right now, 43 points last night, and he's in the top 6.|
|7. Kawhi Leonard|\-3|We'll see if he stays in Toronto, but he's been clutch with 26/9 averages as well as consistent. Good year so far.|
|8. Stephen Curry|\+1|His shooting efficiency is actually on pace to be a career best. He came back from injury and he's kept himself in the top 10, just the few players ahead of him have somehow played even more ridiculous. I think he'll move back up.|
|9. Anthony Davis|\-4|Career high 5 APG a game with improved defense, but the AD to LA talk is heating up and the Pelicans kind of need to get some stuff together. Either way still a bonafide top 10 player.|
|10. Russell Westbrook|\-2|Averaging a triple double for the 3rd straight season but Paul George is the one shining. That speaks volumes to the good situation OKC has. Could they compete with Golden State? We'll see.|
|11. Joel Embiid|\-5|26/13/4 averages, it's been a..somewhat quiet month for his standards but Philly is successful and he's been consistent.|
|12. Kyrie Irving|\+1|Max Kellerman: the Celtics are NOT better off without Kyrie Irving|
|13. Blake Griffin|\-2|26/9/5 averages and putting the hecklers in their place.|
|14. DeMar DeRozan|\+3|He's played well in the Spurs system and the team is back in the top 8 seeds.|
|15. Damian Lillard|same|The West is a bloodbath, but 2 months in Portland is sitting at a 5 seed and Lillard is having a career season low key.|
|16. Kyle Lowry|same|Has been kind of injured, but with 14/10 averages for the best team in the NBA he gets his respect.|
|17. Jimmy Butler|\-3|His impact on the 76ers has been clear, the team is sitting at a 3 seed and he's shooting the most efficient he ever has with them.|
|18. Ben Simmons|\+6|2 triple double's in the last 3 games, shooting 58% from the field, Philly winning, looking more comfortable with Jimmy Butler in the mix. He's a top 20 player.|
|19. Andre Drummond|\+2|18/16 averages, a truly unique player in today's game, I would consider him just about a guaranteed all star right now.|
|20. Steven Adams|\+6|Ranked 26th on December 3, I said that was likely his ceiling. I was wrong. Long considered a meme on this sub, Adams is having a breakout season and is now a serious candidate for the all star game.|
|21. Rudy Gobert|\+1|Career high in PPG, FG%, and low key having a career year. Mitchell might have sophomore slumped but Gobert is the least of Utah's worries.|
|22. Kemba Walker|\-2|He's actually shooting the least efficient he has in 3 seasons. But, the Hornets are..just kind of a mini mess and that's not his fault. A month ago I would have thought it was a guarantee he stays in Charlotte after this year. Not so sure now.|
|23. Karl-Anthony Towns|\+8|He's crucial to Minnesota's success. Unreal talent that has him a top 25 player right now but to move higher than this needs to show more.|
|24. John Wall|\+3|A 40/14 game vs. the Lakers a few games ago helps. Shooting the most efficient he has in his career low key. A polarizing player with his contract but he's a top 25 player right now.|
|25. Jrue Holiday|same|The Pelicans have issues but Holiday continues to be low key elite. Dude can put up 25/12 (like last night) and you won't even notice. |
|26. Klay Thompson|\-8|Shooting the least efficient he has since 2012-2013, but 22 PPG and he's shown the ability to go off any random night.|
|27. Bradley Beal|\+6|Overall has progressed from last season despite the issues in DC.|
|28. Victor Oladipo|\-5|Pacers are 4th in the west and he's got a career high in RPG + APG. But scoring wise he's not where he was at last year. But, he did recently come back from injury and could for sure move back up.|
|29. Chris Paul|\-10|Averaging a career low in PPG and shooting the least efficient he has since 2006-2007. But, he's had some good games still (like last night) and stays in the top 30.|
|30. Mike Conley|\+8|Will he make the all star game? This might be his best chance but the Grizzlies have been a mess since the trade fiasco.|
|31. Clint Capela|\-3|Has improved from last year and has been consistent, if the Rockets can get back in a consistent groove he can move up.|
|32. Jayson Tatum|\+7|Consistent scorer, underrated on this sub for whatever weird reason, nearly matching his ridiculous efficiency from last year on a higher volume of shots. It's been progress this year.|
|33. CJ McCollum|\-4|Career worst from 3 point land isn't good, but he comes up in clutch moments and at 22 PPG for the 5 seed Blazers he keeps a top 35 spot.|
|34. Serge Ibaka|\+2|Having a career scoring year for the best team in the NBA, I feel like this is probably his ceiling but I said that about Steven Adams 17 days ago so who knows.|
|35. Pascal Siakam|\-1|The consistency has continued 2 months into the season and he looks to be one of the more unique players going into next decade.|
|36. Devin Booker|\-4|He's been great the last 4 games and is starting to assert himself, up 10 spots from his finish in 2017-2018. 32% 3 PT is bad but he'll move up if he keeps playing the way he has.|
|37. Luka Doncic|\+16|A unique player who keeps making a name for himself with 19/7/5 averages as a teenager. We'll see how far he can move up throughout the season.|
|38. Julius Randle|\+13|19/10 averages, improved long range shooting, and a scoring threat nobody in the NBA wants to guard.|
|39. LaMarcus Aldridge|\+1|He's regressed from last year's All NBA level, but still a top 40 player who has been more consistent as of late.|
|40. Tobias Harris|\-10|Career high in PPG with nice efficiency, but with the Clippers struggles lately you'd like to see him do more. Still a top 40 player but hasn't been able to get over the consistency hump to reach his top 25 potential.|
|41. Khris Middleton|\-6|As Giannis breaks out even more, Middleton is taking a back seat but that being said he's still been a solid number 2 option for the number 2 team in the East.|
|42. Eric Bledsoe|\+6|Bledsoe is one of the toughest point guard matchups in the NBA, has upped the consistency, very underrated.|
|43. Donovan Mitchell|\+1|The shooting efficiency is down, 5-26 last night is not good. But Utah still won and the ridiculous talent is still there just needs to put everything together.|
|44. Draymond Green|\+2|Scoring wise he's clearly down, thankfully the other areas of his game have remained elite and he's still crucial to the Warriors' success.|
|45. Domantas Sabonis|\+5|My very clear pick for 6MOY right now. Continues to be consistent and has shown he can be special long term. I'm serious, in 2021 we could be talking about a top 15 player.|
|46. Marc Gasol|\-5|I'm a very passionate Grizzlies fan, but when I saw the Ringer had him as the number 10 player in the NBA I laughed out loud. He's better than last year but he doesn't give 100% at all times, and can get beat on defense by clearly inferior players a lot. Still, a step up from last year when I had him 61st.|
|47. Jusuf Nurkic|\-4|Has shown ridiculous talent at times but a bit inconsistent. Still, a top 50 overall player this year with 14/10 averages on the winning Blazers.|
|48. Al Horford|\-11|Has been injured, value down|
|49. Zach LaVine|\-4|His scoring talent is ridiculous, but with him injured now I'm interested to see the effect on his value until he comes back.|
|50. Nikola Vucevic|\-1|Last night showed us all we need to know about how important he is to this Magic team, when they lost by 39 to San Antonio without him.|
|51. Myles Turner|\+18|Sabonis might have the flair, but I would argue Turner is the biggest reason for this team's success in the month of December. Low key a DPOY candidate.|
|52. DeAndre Jordan|\+7|He's been consistent, Mavs now down to 9 seed but he's not fun to guard for opposing centers.|
|53. De'Aaron Fox|\+13|Fox continues his impressive sophomore leap and is now a borderline top 50 player.|
|54. Jamal Murray|\+2|As I saw another redditor mention, if Murray can become an elite passer this Nuggets team could become the new Warriors.|
|55. Derrick Rose|\+6|His incredible bounce back year continues and he is the clear favorite for MIP.|
|56. Thaddeus Young|\+22|Like Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young makes a big leap as well. He's been very impressive this month and a thread on this forum mentioned he should be Eastern Conference Player of the Week earlier in the month.|
|57. Gary Harris|\-15|Still injured, value down.|
|58. Josh Richardson|\-4|Hasn't been as flashy as earlier in the season but consistently putting up buckets.|
|59. Lou Williams|\-12|Struggled a bit this month, now injured and value down.|
|60. Robert Covington|\-3|Crucial on defense, has been inconsistent on offense but a very nice 22 point game last night.|
|61. JJ Redick|\-1|Still averaging a career high in PPG at 34 years old for the winning 76ers.|
|62. Jonas Valanciunas|\+6|An interesting case. Played well at the beginning of the month but now injured. He's valuable to this Raptors team but overshadowed.|
|63. Paul Millsap|\-5|Injured, value down. |
|64. DeAndre Ayton|\+1|It's been a very up and down month, but the 23/18 game last night shows just how talented he can be.|
|65. Aaron Gordon|\-13|I'm a big Aaron Gordon fan and he has a unique skillset, but he hasn't been consistent enough lately and the Magic need more of him.|
|66. Kevin Love|\-4|Still injured, value down|
|67. Brandon Ingram|\-3|Has shown flashes of talent, but injured right now and value down.|
|68. Joe Ingles|\+4|Has been inconsistent scoring, then he has games like the 20 pointer in a win vs. the Warriors last night and overall has been efficient on the season. Value down from last year but still a top 75 talent.|
|69/. Montrezl Harrell|\-6|Still putting in work with 15/7, but with the Clippers struggling he moves down this list.|
|70. Buddy Hield|\+24|Buddy Hield makes a big leap. His scoring has remained efficient and he's going to be dangerous for a while.|
|71. Kyle Kuzma|\+8|Overall progress has been made from his rookie season. We'll see what his ceiling is but so far so good.|
|72. Danilo Gallinari|\-1|Gallinari gets buckets but his impact other than 3 point shooting is minimal. Still, a big bounce back from being injured last year.|
|73. Willie Cauley-Stein|same|He's an interesting player. Ridiculous talent, inconsistent but the talent is there. Will the Kings sign him long term? IDK but someone will.|
|74. TJ Warren|\+7|Playing consistent and his ridiculous 3 point shooting surge makes him a top 75 player right now. |
|75. Andrew Wiggins|\+5|He's played a lot better in December and is back in the top 75. Still a long way to go but there's been progress.|
|76. Malcolm Brogdon|\+7|Low key having a great year. Having a hamstring issue right now but has been very consistent on the floor.|
|77. Bojan Bogdanovic|\+16|Having a career season, at 16 PPG with ridiculous efficiency. Playing consistent and making a name for himself.|
|78. Dennis Schroder|\-8|Crucial to the team's success, progress from last year, but let's not get suspended for stupid stuff.|
|79. Nikola Mirotic|\-24|Injured and value way down. Pelicans struggling and his great scoring year can't overcome the odd fit in the lineup right now.|
|80. Marcus Morris|\-5|Minor injury right now but still one of the nicest scoring threats off the bench in the league.|
|81. Jeff Teague|\+9|Had some nice passing games that raised his value (career high 8.3 APG) but needs to stay healthy to stay here.|
|82. Ricky Rubio|\+2|It hasn't been the greatest year but 13/6/4 averages with some nice games here and there are enough to keep him firmly in the top 100 for now.|
|83. Goran Dragic|\-16|Has been injured this month, value down.|
|84. Caris LeVert|\+1|Still injured but value up. |
|85. Hassan Whiteside|\-8|Chemistry issues aren't helping (and were somewhat predictable) but he's basically a top 100 talent blindfolded and it would take a lot for him to fall out.|
|86. Harrison Barnes|\+14|Cracked the top 100 early in the month. Has continued to be efficient + consistent and is steadily moving up.|
|87. Spencer Dinwiddie (RE-ENTRY)|\+17|It's been a great month for him. Nets are winning, scoring efficient, and just signed an extension. Stock Rising.|
|88. Otto Porter Jr|\-1|Injured and value about the same but after a top 55 finish last year this isn't good.|
|89. Dwyane Wade |\-3|Hasn't played all the time, but still showing why he's a legend. About to turn 37 and still a clear top 100 player right now.|
|90. Jaylen Brown|\-16|Good start to the month but last 3 games 6-25 shooting. There is no way he should be a borderline top 100 player, he stays in the top 90 but needs to step his game up.|
|91. John Collins (NEW)|\+54|Clearly a big riser. Dude is dangerous and we are looking at a top 25 talent if he can get a consistent 3 point shot. Still 21, look out.|
|92. Dario Saric|\+6|His ceiling might not be what we thought a year ago (53rd overall in 2017-2018) but he looks like he can be a very solid role player for years to come.|
|93. D'Angelo Russell (NEW)|\+13|It's been low key a very good year for D'Angelo. Has improved and is showing the ceiling he had in the draft over 3 years ago can still somehow be reached.|
|94. Jerami Grant (NEW)|\+16|He's had a great year overall and a top 100 ranking proves this. His start to the season was very slow and so was OKC's, not a coincidence.|
|95. Darren Collison (RE-ENTRY)|\+18|It's been an up and down year. Struggled in November but he's been solid in Indiana's successful month and climbs back into the top 100. Maybe not where he was at last year but still talented.|
|96. Tim Hardaway Jr.|\-20|His overall scoring efficiency is actually down from last year and other players on this team are standing out more. Still, at 21 PPG he keeps his top 100 spot for now.|
|97. Enes Kanter|\-9|Back to back Knicks, Kanter has talent..basically would be a top 50 player 8 years ago. He's been a consistent scorer though low key and stays in the top 100.|
|98. Derrick Favors|\-6|Like Kanter, Favors is probably a top 50 player 10 years ago. Still a key veteran for Utah but we'll see if he can keep his top 100 spot next month.|
|99. Danny Green (NEW)|\+6|Danny Green finally cracks the top 100. He's been stable and efficient for the Raptors all season and is crucial to the team's success.|
|100. Marcus Smart (RE-ENTRY)|\+9|Marcus Smart edges Jarrett Allen for the final top 100 spot. His offensive efficiency is at a career high and he's been a key force behind how the Celtics have been able to get back on track.|

348,The Spurs' leverage disappears if the Lakers sign PG,0,8ukv3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ukv3i/the_spurs_leverage_disappears_if_the_lakers_sign/,120,1530231169,"I firmly believe that PG signing would be enough to secure a commitment from LeBron. 


Here is why: LeBron is the most calculated player in league history. He is undoubtedly aware of the trade negotiations and conditions surrounding the Kawhi trade. 


LeBron has only one objective: to be on the best team possible. 


As soon as PG signs to the Lakers LeBron is assured of playing alongside at least one star AND crucially his commitment to the Lakers would severely limit the offers the Spurs will get from competing teams and essentially force a Kawhi trade to the Lakers. 


Why would this be the case? Because a) the Spurs would no longer be able to say ""you are trading for Kawhi and LeBron"" in negotiations and b) other teams considering trading for Kawhi would be a lot more reticent to do so with Kawhi already saying he wants to be a Laker and a super team waiting for him there.

This is the last four seasons by James harden. He is putting up legendary numbers. Any other time in NBA history and he is either first or second best so why not now. The team up of Curry and KD has made them both susceptible to inconsistency. No longer are we seeing one or the other stand out.

Chris Paul Why?  Not as Flashy, but just as good a scorer and far superior floor general.  Much more complete player.  Also the most clutch player in the league.  Not that Rose isn't clutch just not as clutch as the most clutch player in the league. 

Deron Williams Before his exile in NJ was considered on par with CP3.  Has come back from injury fully rehabbed, just has a shitty team.  Pretty much same reasons as CP3  Just as good a scorer although not as flashy and a far superior floor general.


**Depends on how your team is constructed**

Rajon Rondo Best defender at the PG position bar none.  Except maybe his team mate Avery Bradley WHO IS NOT A SHOOTING GUARD.  Best court vision except for maybe Nash.  Very good at getting to rim (not as good as Rose) and not a good shooter.  What Rose does have on Rondo is a much better jumper that really opens up his game and makes him a much more complete offensive player.  Rose is a decent defender in his own right as well. Rose can't touch Rondo's court vision with a 10 foot pole.  Depending on how your team is constructed I could see either being selected over the other. 



Russell Westbrook is very similar to Rose.  The big difference between them I think is that Westbrook is more athetlic and has more potential while Rose is more developed and skilled.  Westbrook can get to the basket ANY time he wants.  Rose is a good penetrator, but he  ain't at Westbrook's level.  Also Rose isn't capable of going on the kind of offensive tears Westbrook is in short periods of time, but he is a much more consistent player and won't have the shit games that Westbrook sometimes has.

####**""Trae's only been playing as well as Luka for half a season""**  
In the last 4 of 5.5 months, Trae has clearly been the superior player. Although he still lags behind in PPG and RBG, he has been considerably more efficient (a cool 56.4 TS% vs. below-league-average 53.8 TS%), shooting better from the field, from the stripe, and from 3 (an icy 37.5% vs. a sad sad 31.7%).

####**""But Trae doesn't contribute to winning! What about defense?""**  
The Mavs are only THREE games above the Hawks, and they've gone 19-34 since December 1st. Meanwhile, the Hawks have posted 21-30.

AND Trae's had a higher Net Rating than Luka in that timespan. Trae's DRTg is indeed worse than Luka's, but Trae still contributes to more winning basketball.

And Trae hasn't missed a game this season, a valuable skill in itself.

####**""Trae doesn't have to carry the whole team on his back the way Luka does!""**

Please watch a hawks game before commenting.

He's 24 yo and people act like hes a player whose reached his prime and has no upside at all.
The biggest thing I see against Kyrie is his defense which too me is personally surprising considering how much he looked up to Kobe, you would think Kobe would of instilled the importance of defense.

Besides that dude is a great player and would great player to make an elite tandem in the league. Imagine kyrie paired with demarcus or anthony davis for example.

I also feel people feel compelled to shit out Kyrie to prop up Lebron, its as if people feel that by celebrating kyrie you are dismissing lebron in some way.

Capela and CP3 had the worst series of their careers almost, so him losing to them is considered a choke on his part and has continued the narrative of him not performing in the playoffs.. He averaged 35,7,8 on good efficiency... just why do people do this to Harden..?

-Kawhi Leonard gets to the face the Warriors without KD and eventually even without Klay, he gets tremendous help from Lowry and FVV (who received a Finals MVP vote) and wins the series, and is now crowned the best player in the league by most because he's now the Finals MVP, and beat an injured Warriors roster.

- The most confusing part is how James Harden was able to put up better stats and had a better overall series against the Warriors while they were at full strength, while having a worse roster than Kawhi, yet still is considered worse than Kawhi and a continued choker. 

-And no, Kawhi did not ""completely take over games or put up insane stats in the fourth, unlike Harden""

-These things make me reconsider a little at least. The hypocrisy and media narrative really controls what the fans think and spout.


-Also to anyone who's about to make the defense argument, Curry was not a two way guy in his unanimous year, yet he was BY FAR the best player that year.

356,Dear Kobe Bryant,22,tz2x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tz2x2/dear_kobe_bryant/,161,1337713151,"I've been a fan of the Lakers since I watched Magic and Kareem win titles in the 80s.  

I remember that wonderful summer when we landed Shaq, the game's best center at the time, and also drafted a 17 year old kid named Kobe Bryant.

I remember watching you as a child in a league filled with guys twice your age.  I remember when we played Utah in the playoffs during your rookie year, and Stockton and Malone were too much for you guys.  I remember you launching threes at the end of those games that didn't even draw iron... but I remember thinking wow, that kid is gutsy.

And when Glen Rice came to town, and suddenly the Lakers won 60 games, I thought maybe this team could be really good.  And then we played the Blazers in the playoffs, and it was elimination game, and they were up by FIFTEEN POINTS in the 4th quarter, and Scottie Pippen looked filled with confidence, I admit man, I was scared.  But you and Shaq weren't scared.  You guys pulverized them, erased that 15 point lead, and we made it to the finals.  And for the next couple of years, no one could stop the Lakers.  I almost felt sorry for Indiana, Philidelphia, and New Jersey in the finals, because they never looked like they even had a chance.

And then one year the Spurs wooped our asses, and I thought well, they need new blood.  We never really replaced Glen Rice.  Maybe we just need another scorer.  And then that offseason, bam, we got Karl Malone and Gary Payton.  And then you spent that whole year complaining about how Shaq was out of shape, how the Lakers looked ""old and tired"", and how you weren't getting as many shots as you should be getting.

And you know what, I thought it was kind of weird that a guy who averaged 25 points a game was saying he didn't get enough shots.  

And then they shipped Shaq out of town to make room for your ego, and Phil Jackson quit and said you were uncoachable, and Karl Malone said you were a bad team mate, and Shaq went to Miami and won a title with DWade, while you were all by yourself on the Lakers.  And you averaged 178 points per game, and that one game you scored 786 points in a single quarter, and the team was finally, unquestionably ""yours"", except for one problem: it sucked.  We won 34 games a year for a while there and it was pretty ugly, Kobe, I'm not gonna lie to you.  It was pretty damn ugly.

And then some good things happened.  We got Gasol... a guy who on paper was the perfect team mate for you.  A good passer, good shooter, skilled post player, committed rebounder.  He was solid, hard working, and he hardly ever gets hurt.  

And the two of you got together, and Phil Jackson was back, and damned if you guys didn't get back to the top.  And suddenly Shaq looked old in Phoenix, and I started to think maybe you were right all along, maybe your dynasty would one day be as great as Magic and Kareem's.  

But Kobe, this season, you really lost me again.  I don't understand why you played almost 40 minutes a game when you have more games and minutes under your belt than all but 15 guys in history.  I don't understand why you took it upon yourself to decide that Gasol was now the ""number three"" option on your team, and to declare that to the general public.  And I don't understand why you feel the need to jack up 25 shots per game, almost more than Bynum and Gasol put together, even though those guys shoot in the 50s and you shoot in the low 40s.  Kobe, those guys score more efficient points than you do, bro.  Why don't you feed them the ball more?

Kobe, what I think you don't understand is that being a great competitor and a great team mate isn't just about intensity.  It's also about INSPIRING people.  It's about motivating people.  It's about empowering people.  All you seem to do with your team mates is to give them muted praise when you win, and yell and gripe at them when you lose.

Remember when you were on Youtube, trashing Andrew Bynum and saying they should ""trade his ass"" for Jason Kidd?  Remember when you called Gasol ""soft"" all those times?  See dude, that's what makes guys want to not play with you.  And when guys don't want to play with you, they lose motivation, they lose energy.  

I'm not sure why you felt the need to jack up 130 shots in the series against OKC, when Gasol and Bynum combined only took about 120, even though they both shoot at a much higher percentage than you do, and even though we know the All Kobe All The Time Offense doesn't really work.  It never has, right?

So please, Kobe, do Laker nation a favor.  AFTER they trade Gasol (because they will, the Lakers do whatever you tell them to do) and AFTER they trade Bynum (because he's already asking to be traded, because he hates you), PLEASE, PLEASE do us a favor and finally learn from your many mistakes.  Don't throw your new team mates under the buss.  Don't launch up contested jumper after ill-advised fadeaway on possession after possession even though there's still 21 seconds left on the shotclock and even though there's two hall of fame calibur guys wide open.  Please, don't do that.  Instead, try getting your team mates involved in the game.  Don't ask for them to be traded, don't go on KCAL 9 and tell everyone what the pecking order is as far as talent, don't publicly question their commitment, don't undermine their games, don't tell them to stop worrying about shots and just worry about rebounding and defense, in short, don't do ALL of the things you've always done to your poor team mates.

Just be nice to them, let them play their game, and especially if we somehow get Dwight Howard for Bynum, Kobe, please, understand that he is a sensitive guy and he doesn't want to be bullied by a big loudmouth like you in the media.  Just repsect him, let him be himself, and if you lose, just lose like a man.  It's ok to lose, Kobe.  Lots of teams lose every single year in the playoffs, and they manage to do so without giving their team mates a tongue lashing in the media.

That's about all.  Also, one last thing, please abandon the Heroball you like to play in the closing minutes of close games.  It's a bad offense.  If we got to a tie game by playing team ball, then lets finish the game with team ball.  We can all read, buddy, so we know that you only hit those mythical game-winners about a third of the time.  The other two third of those horrible shots you take with 0:21 left in the close games just miss the mark entirely, so please, knock it with the 4th quarter masonry clinics you like to put on in close games.",0.55,controversial,5/22/12 11:59

It's just as nasty and toxic as the garbage Kaepernick had thrown at him from NFL fans. The really messed up thing is that there is a ton of support for the thought, but Kyrie has to eat all the damage himself because everyone else aside from Dwight and Avery Bradley are afraid to speak up, and people are accusing him of doing it for attention or some stupid ulterior motive. If people didn't leak it, there would be zero attention because no one would know about it! 

What Kyrie Irving's personal beliefs are, what he did in Boston, or whatever else have no relevance at all to his argument because he's just correct. Just because he might believe the Earth is flat doesn't mean he's wrong if he says 1+1=2.

Also people need to stop pretending that they care about mid/low level NBA players financial security. Also pretending to care about the players potentially having an even bigger platform if they resume play. That's so phony.

One said he’s “woke college kid on twitter but playing in the nba”. There’s been tons of reference to his flat earth theory, woj called him “a disruptor”, lots of folks on here wouldn’t want him on their team. All this because he believes the NBA season should be canceled. 

Let me say, as a black dude, I’ve always found that the actions that have brought change or progression for black folks have always been unpopular and decried by the mainstream. As such, often when I see any sort of movement intended to seek justice for black folks and that move is widely popular or accepted by the mainstream, it gives me pause. 

Kyrie is 100% right. The NBA players boycotting the rest of the season is the most powerful statement they can make. I saw a post on here that claimed the reason Ali was able to make such strong social impact is because he was playing well and speaking out simultaneously. Ironically that same poster accused Kyrie of being out of touch with reality. They either are out of touch with reality themselves or simply refuse to realize the obvious truth which was that Ali REFUSED to be drafted for war. Him refusing, and losing his boxing license is irrefutably what makes Ali who he is. 

Lebron is my favorite player ever. He’s wrong here. Sure you can play and try to promote however you can, ie T-shirts, post game interviews, whatever. However, nothing would be as powerful as hearing the best basketball player, probably ever, certainly in a long time, announce he’s sitting out a season to protest racial injustice. Will he do it? Probably not. Is it fair to ask him to do it? Probably not. I understand it’s hard to be a black athlete in a capitalist system. Yet that’s the hand he’s been dealt and fairly or unfairly, this will factor into how people judge him in the future. 

For everyone else that believes somehow the NBA returning gives them a greater platform and thus they can influence more change, I have to again vehemently disagree. The idea of positive change as a gradual event that just comes with more time is not good enough for us black people. It has to happen now and demands radical actions. The NBA players boycotting there season would a step in that direction.",0.45,controversial,6/13/20 18:52

Over the past five or so years the parity problem has grown out of control in the league. The first time that I personally can remember a team getting assembled that seemed to be an obvious favorite a championship was the Lakers back in 2004. Then the Heat happened in 2010. Luckily for the league these ""super"" teams did not win every year in which they are active. I've always said the worst thing for a sport is when one team or player dominates.

Now, on to how I feel about the Kevin Love trade. I fully expect downvotes because it's hard for people to grasp how a Cavs fan can be upset about acquiring Kevin Love but I can honestly say that I am disappointed. For me, getting Love was overkill and what bothers me most is the fact that there was no way in hell Love would have wanted to play in Cleveland without LeBron and Kyrie. It is blatant ring chasing. I would rather see a team win a championship with players that developed their skills with that team and are dedicated to performing the best they can for that given city and franchise than a team assembled of various all stars taking less money just to cruise to a championship. I realize winning a championship is never easy but my point is that these players know what they are doing. They know that their legacy will be tarnished by not carrying or leading the team to a championship.

If the Cavs do with a title over the next two years what will LeBron's legacy be? He couldn't win by himself in Cleveland before, so he collaborated with two other all stars. He wins in Miami but many still feel his legacy has not been fulfilled. Coming back to Cleveland was his chance but now with Love joining him he's back in the same situation as Miami. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm very happy that the Cavs will be competitive this year but I can't help but feel that this trend of collaboration is bad for the league and any championship won with the new ""Big 3"" will have a figurative asterik next to it. This is probably not a popular opinion but I wanted to see if anyone else (especially Cavs fans felt the same way).",0.49,controversial,8/23/14 19:56

Here are the facts - Lebron stepped over draymond green, green retaliated with a swing to the groin. Lebron received a technical, and draymond a flagrant and suspension. 

So here's the deal. Stepping over people, taunting, and things of that nature are typically great reasons to deal out a technical foul. So the NBA got this one RIGHT, and the refs WRONG. Lebron did not initiate any more unnecessary physical contact(unless you want to nitpick that lebrons calf brushed on green's shoulder, or something like that) so all he receives is a tech. 

Draymond green initiated unnecessary physical contact, which warrants a flagrant 1 or 2. He got a one, which still means a suspension. What is so unclear about that? If sides flipped and Lebron swung at Green's groin, the outrage would be MASSIVE and everyone would cry for a flagrant. 

Looking back at the thunder series, yeah he did deserve to be suspended but the fact is he DIDNT. If he did get that extra flagrant vs Okc, he would've been suspended for a game GSW would've likely lost. Now let's assume he's suspended and the Dubs still win out the series, and the altercation between Green and LBJ still happens. Green will still get a flagrant 1, and receive another one game suspension. So what is the problem exactly?

The only people really, who should be upset about Green's suspension should be Thunder fans. They were screwed, and that is wrong on the NBA's fault. But things happen. Everyone else on the Warriors bandwagon really shouldn't have anything to complain. Nobody earned all those flagrants except for Green so he has nobody to blame but himself for his physical play. 

For those who claim ""How should you react to nuts on your neck?!?""... Think about this. Lebron steps over him, draymond DOESNT swing, and gets in lebrons face and bumps chests with him. That would immediately result in a double tech, no suspension, the refs would have gotten it right, and we would enter game 5 with both teams having their whole squad. Point is, what Green did was completely unnecessary and warranted a flagrant one, leading to his suspension and no one has ANY REASON to be upset with the way the NBA handled this.

These 2013 NBA previews have just been lazy. Because I'm a Nuggets fan, I thought the Nuggets video was particularly bad. They talked more about weed than the Nuggets. They didn't talk about the new coach or the new GM and what they brought to the team. The only thing they talked about was the new second/third string point guard and Faried potentially being traded. The video was 14 minutes long and 10 minutes was dedicated to weed, JaVale's mom, Jalen's draft suit, and cinnamon. It wasn't a team preview. I don't know. I've watched all the previews and over all I've been really disappointed.

368,I’m not sure if people realize how much worse Lebron’s situation as a young star was compared to other all time greats.,0,b54bau,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b54bau/im_not_sure_if_people_realize_how_much_worse/,64,1553505609,"TL;DR: Kind of feels like Lebron’s always against the odds in some regard, throughout his entire career. Outside of his 4 years with the Heat. 

When speaking of Lebron’s accolades, ring counting, his choice to switch teams multiple times in his prime, his finals record, comparing him to Magic, Kobe, MJ, Duncan, people need to really sit back and realize how much worse Lebron’s situation was compared to others.

Basically every other top 10ish player ever had ANOTHER all-nba/HOF level player early in their career, that helped them win a championship and achieve consistency and continuity with their organization. On top of this, a lot of them had an all time great coach. 

MJ had Scottie. (And Phil Jackson)

Magic had Kareem, Worthy, Cooper & Scott. (And Pat Riley)

Larry Bird had Mchale, Parish and Johnson. (And KC Jones)

Kobe had the actual best player in the league, Shaq. (And Phil Jackson)

Duncan had Robinson. (And Pop.) 



Even modern day legends like Steph, KD or Kawhi, love these guys taking nothing away from their greatness, had much better situations in order to beat Lebron in the finals, but if jerseys were swapped, it wouldn’t have been a contest. 

It’s not a coincidence that these players have more rings than Lebron and won them all with one team. Lebron would have never left if the Cavs would have “gotten” him a D Wade. Or a Kyrie Irving. Let alone, not just a competent coach like Eric Spo, but an all time great HOF coach. 

Just think among all the Bron slander and hate we need to remember that the guy got drafted to the Browns of the NFL. A sorry franchise that had nothing before him, and nothing after him. The only reason he was ever loyal to them in any regard, or went back, is because he just so happened to be born in Akron. 

Just saying, at what point do you say okay I have to take things into my own hands and move around. Sure, it’s led to him having 6 finals losses, but he also has 3 rings with 2 teams. Chasing his 4th on this Lakers contract. For all we know in some parallel universe Lebron could have zero or just 1 ring and way less appearances had he been “loyal.”",0.48,controversial,3/25/19 2:20

373,Why the Lakers will be 2018-2019 NBA Champions,0,8ziz7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ziz7y/why_the_lakers_will_be_20182019_nba_champions/,138,1531839941,"Like many have said recently and I agree with. You can't outgun the Warriors on offense. The way to beat them is flustering their offense and playing fast with lots of transition and fast break points. A key factor in doing this is being able to switch on them defensively. This is what the Houston Rockets did in the playoffs and held them to under 100 points in back to back games.

Now let's take a look at the Lakers roster right now.

PG:

* Lonzo - His solid defense is the only reason he's still on the team. 1.7 steals/game. 0.8 blocks. He's 6'6 allowing him to switch onto taller players. 30% from 3 last year. Still not a good idea to leave him open.
* Rondo - When he's not engaged in the game, he doesn't play defense. But when he is engaged, one of the smartest and fiercest competitors. 2-time all defensive first and second team. Getting old, but no pressure in a starting role. Able to get plenty of rest on bench.
* Isaac Bonga - Kind of an unknown. Only 18. Looks to have a really high ceiling. Extremely athletic at 6'10"". Can shoot and handle the ball. He's listed as playing ""point guard"". Capable of switching onto any position, especially as he continues to grow and develop.
* Gary Payton II - shouldn't play much if at all.

SG:

* KCP - Really solid 3 and D player. Able to switch defensively on 1-3.
* Lance - Pitbull when he's engaged in the game. Embraces the challenge of defending elite players. Able to switch on to 1-3, and some 4. Not really an elite defender, but when you want to fluster the other team, he is a great choice. I can see him drawing technicals out of guys like Draymond and Boogie.
* Josh Hart - I don't know if he's a 1, 2, or 3 - but he's able to switch on all those positions defensively. High effort player. Defensively engaged off the ball. 39.6% from 3 last year.
* Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk - High IQ. Athletic. Great shooter and can score in many ways. 6'6"". This kid looks incredible. Not bad on defense either.
* Andre Ingram - Don't expect to be a factor at all, if he's even on the team just including him because of his story. First NBA game at age 32 last year. Oldest rookie since 1964. His first game was like something out of a movie. Would be really cool if he ended up getting some minutes. Looks like a really good guy and great locker room presence.

SF:

* Ingram - Ceiling is becoming a top 5 player in the league one day. Really solid defensively. Athletic and big wingspan. Can switch onto 1-3. Can play SG or ""point forward"".
* Luol Deng - ?????? Not expecting him to play, but really have no idea? Could be a wildcard if he does end up playing.

PF:

* LBJ - don't need to say anything here.
* Kuzma - Very high ceiling. Maybe one of the most underrated players. Perfect player to play the 4 in a small ball lineup. Can switch onto almost any position. Good 3 shooter, good post moves & ballhandling. Going to be one of my favorite players to watch this year.
* Travis Wear - most likely won't play, though has ability to play positions 1-4.

C:

* McGee - Can switch onto guys like Durant. Showed his defensive value on Lebron in the finals.
* Wagner - 7 footer that can shoot the 3. Not great defensively, but a high IQ and high effort player.
* Zubac - I'm not big on the guy. He's a young 7 footer. Doubt he'll get many minutes. Would be a pleasant surprise if he develops into anything. Good backup in case on injury.

At first I thought the Lakers needed to trade for a guy like Kawhi or Lillard, but the more I think about it, why would you want to bring in an established superstar when you have multiple blossoming superstars on your roster? Kawhi would've been a good fit, but I'm not even sure it's worth giving up 2 of the 3 between kuzma, ingram, lonzo, let alone some draft picks. He barely played last season. Kawhi is a humble superstar, which I like, but his current situation  could've brought in more drama that the Lakers don't need. There are also just a lot of things we don't know about Kawhi's situation and what he wants as a player.

Lebron is the best player and probably the hardest working player in the league. He played every game last year.  These young bucks want to prove themselves now more than ever and will not slack off with him on the team. Bringing in an established superstar would've risked ruining the team chemistry in my opinion. This team has low individual egos and that is exactly what you want in any team sport. We also have future coach Rondo to motivate the team and help Lonzo become an elite point guard.

When you look over the Lakers roster, you will notice how versatile and interchangeable most of their players are. This is what you must do to win in the current NBA. The criticism everyone keeps giving is that the Lakers have no shooters. I think they have plenty for their style of basketball. KCP, Hart, Sviatoslav, Ingram, LBJ, Kuzma, Wagner can all shoot 3 pointers.  Remember, the goal here is not to outdo them on offense. With Lonzo's speed and court vision, they can and will play fast. This is where being a deep team helps them too. They have 4 ""shooting guards"" that I believe will see minutes, all of which have length, stretch the floor and can play the 3 as well. 2 great creative passing point guards that can play defense, with Bonga as a wild card. Solid small forward in Ingram. Lebron can play any position. Kuzma can play 1-4 and then 3 7 foot centers. Having these 7 or so players than can move around positions gives you the ability to tremendously reduce fatigue when you are playing fast and playing hard defense.

Obviously when you have this kind of roster, there are tons of possibilities for different lineups. I believe this is one of their biggest strengths. Let's just imagine one for fun.

1. Lonzo
2. KCP
3. Ingram
4. Kuzma
5. Lebron

I could go on forever listing lineups. There are so many good combinations. They can go small or big. They can have all shooters. They are able to combine the ""surround Lebron with shooters"" style of play which has been effective in the past with the Rockets' abilities to switch defensively which was also effective.

Let's think about the Warriors for a minute. The reaction to the Boogie signing is extremely blown out of proportion in my opinion. This guy has a big potential to be a cancer for the team. He's coming back Achilles injury. He was never the most athletic of players, but it's hard to imagine he's going to come back the same as he was. He's only a low paying one year deal. As great as a passer as he is, I believe he is somewhat of a selfish player. I can see him being a big ball stopper and disruption to the Warriors ball movement, especially when he is in a one year contract deal and presumably wants to prove his worth on the court after being injured so he can get paid next year. Something else about the Warriors that I began to notice last year and maybe I'm wrong, but I sense a looming disruption in team chemistry. Durant has stolen the show from Curry. I watch all the playoff press conferences, and I do think this kind of rubs Curry the wrong way, maybe even just subconsciously. I believe this can ruin the flow of the team's offense where one player tries to play hero ball, or they begin taking turns, rather than executing. This is a great opportunity for the Lakers defense to pounce. Klay Thompson is also in a contract year and he's made it pretty clear that he wants to get paid. Now, I like Klay and he plays great team ball but this is just one more wrench to throw in the team chemistry. And, yes the Lakers do have lots of 1 year deals, but none of these guys are looking to get big contracts afterwards. They are all there to win.

The Cavs kept it close with the Warriors for 2 games and really should've won. That Cavs team was a complete joke. Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love, Jr Smith, a washed up George Hill, Larry Nance. What a complete joke. This Lakers team is unbelievably better than that Cavs team. I know this doesn't mean that much, but Lonzo's only time facing the Warriors was November last season in which the Warriors needed OT to win. They were playing their full lineup. Obviously this is a different Lakers team and they are much better now.

If you believe in NBA conspiracy theories, you know they would love a Lakers v Celtics Finals with Lebron v Kyrie, so maybe the refs will help out the Lakers.

I think it will be the Lakers and Celtics in the finals this season. The Celtics will not be an easy matchup, but I think the Lakers will win.

Please feel free to tell me I'm way off wrong, comment, ask questions or whatever.

Something doesn't show up on the stat sheet, however, and that's Bill Russell's defensive impact. 

The year before Bill arrived, the Celtics had a 90.7 defensive rating, 2nd worst in the NBA. That DRASTICALLY changed when Bill arrived. In all but one season of Bill's career, the Celtics had the leagues best defense by far, often boasting a defensive rating 4-8 pts higher than that of the second place team. After Bill retired, the Celtics immediately dropped from the best defensive team to the 7th best out of 14 teams. They went from a defensive rating 6.9 above average to one that was only 0.6 above average. That's going from a great defensive team to a mediocre team defensively. The Celtics went 34-48 that season, missing the playoffs entirely. 

He has by far the greatest defensive impact out of any player in NBA history and maybe even the greatest impact on one end of the floor. These defensive numbers do not show up in stat sheets, but they do equate into team success which is all that mattered for Bill. 

 It's clear his defensive impact was greater than that of Wilt's offensive impact. Wilt won when he took less shots, and his selfishness often costed his team and his teammates when it mattered. Bill and Hakeem are the only centers to lead a title team in PTS and AST in the playoffs. (Bill did it in 2 runs, one leading in PTS, one in AST)  

As for the ""Bill had 8 HOFers"" argument. It's easier to make the Hall when you're a 6+ champ. Throughout Bill and Wilt's career, they had the exact same number of All Star teammates. People forget Wilt's great teammates over the years: Jerry West, Goodrich, Greer, Cunningham, Elgin Baylor, Thurmond, Guy Rodgers, Tom Gola, Chet Walker, etc... In all of Wilt's scoring title seasons, he didn't win a title. He also only led the playoffs ONCE in playoff ppg, so it didnt exactly translate either. 

In the season where Wilt led the league in assists, he avoided HOF teammate Chet Walker because he liked to take an dribble or 2 after receiving a pass from Wilt, which did not count as an assist. This type of stat oriented mentality doesn't equal into team success under any means. His inflated numbers often costed his team and teammates an opportunity to improve and play as a team to win championships. 

In his scoring title seasons, he never won a title, only made 1 finals, and had a 22-30 playoff record. It was only when he sacrificed those numbers to win that he experienced success. 

""Oh but Wilt was the most athletic player ever, he could do this and that"". Bill was actually extremely athletic as well, and athleticism isn't the be all end all of basketball. There have many players with extreme athletic ability who aren't then other guys with less those of gifts. This is NBA basketball, not the Olympics. 

Again, Wilt may woo the causal fan with his marvelous numbers or tales about his extreme atheltic ability, but when it comes to the game of basketball, it's clear who had the most impact when he was on the court.

While player's usually don't step their game up in regular season, they will against the rockets.  We're talking about pride and ego that NBA players have a bounty of.

Felton wants to shut people up   -   He's really going to want to show his worth, get into great shape and play hard.  He is playing the underachiever who wants to show up, which he obviously has the talent to do.  

I'm not trying to get into marketing and money issues, but from a purely basketball standpoint, this change at worst will be a wash and most likely we will see the re-awakening of a quality point guard who has something to prove.  Jeremy has everything to lose.  We might be incredibly surprised at how good this mix of players works and how Raymond Felton may be a sleeper for an All-star caliber season.

I've been a raptors fan my entire life, and as a result a huge Vince Carter fan. The original post with 1k+ upvotes has a lot of hatred for VC in it. VC did not convince TMAC to leave, he was in-fact extremely upset that Tmac chose to leave in the 2000 off-season, this has been well-documented. The post also claims that Vince himself claimed that he exposed plays to opposing teams, Vince not at all at any point exposed plays to opposing teams and instead shot that down during his time in NJ. I can't believe that post is getting so much attention with such terrible sources so I'll provide some here to back up VC and how the media was going completely against him near the end of his tenure with the raptors.
Source 1: https://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/did-carter-tip-off-sonics-on-play-selection-1.506817
Read this article carefully, none of the Raptors players on the court heard it, isn't that weird? None of the Sonics players want to be named isn't that weird? This news came out the day after VC got traded, isn't that weird? This is an outtake from the article on what VC's response to this accusation was ""Reached late last week through Raptors spokesman Jim LaBumbard, Carter was quoted by the News Tribune as saying: ""I'm not going to comment on something as ridiculous as that.""""
Source 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G2L0WZPM-Q

This source is about Tmac leaving toronto and how he felt betrayed by management, not VC, at the end of the article you can see that VC plans to resign with toronto and tmac cannot understand why he would, why would VC want to resign if he wanted tmac to leave, when he publicly has said he loved playing with tmac and publicly wished his cousin would stay.
Source 4: https://youtu.be/gugj9qfLD7w?t=2272
This is another vc documentary from 2015, (link starts at relevant point), where VC talks about his experience with Rob Babcock from day 1 that Rob Babcock got hired. 
Overall, if VC hated Toronto, why would he even choose to begin his career here? Sure he got drafted here, but he could have left right of the get-go like many other players have refused to play here before. He resigned for 6 years, and yet people still say he just randomly started hating Toronto. There was a buildup to it, and people should recognize that.

The broadcast will typically join in and keep repeating replays of whatever they are fixating on for that game.

This normally prompts the audience (especially fans of the losing team) to care more about the rant topic than why their team is actually losing on the court.

When people bring up Steph for MVP, people shout but he's not even the best player on his own team. How can you be MVP if you're team goes 10-1 without you.

If we're using that logic, then why is Giannis not ahead of Lebron in the MVP race?

Lets first take a look at the individual stats for each player:

Giannis: 29/10/5 on 62% TS  
Lebron: 27/8/9 on 64% TS

Not a big difference either way, I will also add Giannis is playing better defense than Lebron this year he is in the running for 2nd team all-defense at PF while lebron is not in the running for any all-defense team this year.

Now lets take a look at the VALUE each player adds for their respective teams.

here are the on/off stats for the cavs and bucks:

player|ORtg|DRtg|Net Rtg
:--|:--|:--|:--
Giannis ON|112.5|108.6|+3.9
Giannis OFF|105.8|117.3|-11.5
Lebron ON|114.8|113.6|+1.2
Lebron OFF|106.9|103.9|+3.0

The cavs actually have a higher net rtg when lebron is off the court then on the court. Even though they had a poor game last night, the bench has been playing really good all year the cavs statistically have the fifth best bench in the nba. If you took Lebron off the cavs,  they would still be a borderline playoff team and might miss the playoffs by one or two games in the eastern conference.

Bench|Pts|Pts allowed
:--|:--|:--
Cavs|41.4|32.4
MIL|24.9|36.5

If you take giannis off of the bucks, not only do they miss the playoffs, but they legitimately become in the running with the Atlanta Hawks for the team with the worst record in the NBA. They have arguably one of the worst coaches in the league(Jason Kidd) and statistically the third worst bench in the NBA, while the Cavs have the fifth best bench in the NBA.

This paper revisits the topic to determine if the effects found previously are still prominent in recent NBA history using nearly 800 free agent signings from 2011-2017. Our data set using only free agency signings allows us to control for the effects of performance and player, coach, general manager, and team characteristics on player's wages, which presented a data limitation of the previous literature. Using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and weighted linear regression models, we find that black athletes are underpaid relative to their counterparts. We find that 72.7% of the wage gap found is explained by racial discrimination in our preferred specification. Black players receive on average 20.5% less than their counterparts, all else equal. Moreover, we investigate different sources of discrimination in this labor market. Weighted quantile regressions show evidence of consumer discrimination in that black players with high audience visibility (role and star players) experience a larger racial wage gap. The size of the share of the white population is shown to be positively correlated with the racial wage gap. No employee nor employer discrimination is found.""

I know its long, probably unbearable on mobile.  Tried to format it so that you can easily see my picks without having to read every word.  Let me know about any huge disagreements you have, or even minor quibbles. My criteria is mostly about who were the best this season.  I’ve watched a TON of games this year and have been watching the NBA for many years.  I look at counting stats and advanced stats.  Team record and games played matter, but not as much as the individual statistics as those indicate individual impact and being that these are for the most part individual awards, I weigh them heavier.  Also, note that I have been working on this for a number of days now, so not all the numbers will be exact, but I don’t think a 0.1 difference in PER should change my vote.   This year was pretty tough on who to leave off for some of the awards and so many players missed a good chunk of the season.  Let me know what you guys think.

###MVP

**1. James Harden**

This was a perfect example of an MVP season.  A player that’s been great for a number of years is the best player on the best team in the league and has incredible stats.   Harden led the league in scoring average and missed only a few games.  His .448 FG looks underwhelming at first, but getting to the line 10x a game and making almost four 3s a game puts his eFG at .540 and his TS around .620 which is elite, especially considering his volume of shots.  He led the league in PER, WS, and BPM.  His BPM of 11 is a textbook “amazing year” baseline.  PER of 30 puts him in a very elite group as well.  There’s not too much of an argument for the others, this was a fantastic showing by Harden and I believe he will finally get his first MVP award.  

**2. LeBron James**

Team record is the only thing that makes Harden the sure fire choice.  LeBron had a terrible January, but he played in all the games and by my estimation he had about 12 or 13 “bad” games.  However, playing in all the games will do that and Harden, Steph, Durant etc missed x amount of games and had poor showings on top of that.  LeBron just had most of his bad games in bunches which is what people will hold against him.  The few at the beginning of the year were mainly because he was pulled from the games early as the cavs got dicked down so hard in the first half they had no shot at a comeback.  The games in January were quite disturbing as well, but still, LeBron made over 10 FG a game for the first time since coming back to Cleveland and played the most minutes in the league while posting a career high in assists.  His efficiency is almost exactly what it was last year and topped only by his best three Miami years.  He had one of the years best performances in his 57 point assault in Washington that had the wizards hoping Gilbert Arenas was in the Cavs locker room.  He also led the league in games with a GmSc over 25 (pretty good, for example 21/12/6/5/1 on 10/16FG is right around a 25 GmSc) beating out Davis, Harden and Giannis respectively.  In addition to the massive roster changes/inconsistency, having Lue as a coach and still being in my opinion the clear best player on the planet, I think James warrants a top 2 finish.  


**3. Anthony Davis**

Davis had so many “Holy shit that guy just obliterated the other team” games this year, I could see him as high as first on a few ballots.  He’s in the running for DPOY as well which matters to me, and he really turned up after boogie went down (get well soon bby I love you).  The narrative has been that the supporting cast is trash and well….it is.  Jrue has played well of recent, but he’s not really that close to being an all star player.  Davis is unguardable and can guard nearly anyone in the league.  He led the league in blocks by a huge margin and was 2nd in scoring in an era where the big man is less and less utilized.  This is his best season and deserves all the credit in the world.  Despite him never having won a playoff game, he still averaged 31/11 and 3 blocks against what was the leagues best defense in 2015 on .540FG.  I’m excited to see him in the playoffs regardless of their seed and result.  


**4. Giannis Antetokounmpo**
Despite a middling record, Giannis essentially lit the league on fire this year.  With not much of a jumpshot he was still absolutely unguardable and became a defensive terror.  27/10/5/1.5/1.5 on over 50% from the field is obscene and I wonder if he shouldn’t be higher on the ballot. His showdowns with LeBron this season were classic and neither player could stop the other.  It looks like the bucks will be 8th in the east which is unfortunate as I don’t think they have an asshole’s chance in jail at beating the raptors, but hopefully we can see a few “holy shit this guy in beyond unstoppable and only 24 years old” games to extend the series a bit.  Giannis was top 5 in the league in field goals, PER, FG% of 20+ppg scorers, VORP, WS, scoring, and minutes per game.  This was simply too good of a statistical season not to have him in the top 4.  As far as I’m concerned, these top 4 are without question the top 4, in some order.  The Freak vs Brow debate will be fun these next few years.  

**5.  Damian Lillard**

This spot was difficult.  Westbrook (lol no), Durant, Curry, DeRozan, and Oladipo all got consideration from me.  I think Lillard putting the Blazers as high as they were in the west when many people had them 8th or worse to start the year was the defining reason.  It wasn’t just that they won, they won tons of games down the stretch that were all him.  He just slapped his wrist and ate the other teams’ soul and sank the improbable shot time and time again.  He posted a career high in eFG and FT% at an amazing .917 clip taking over 7 foul shots a game.  While battling the other western guards to make an all star slot, he’ll be ahead of all but one of them on the all-nba teams.  During the Blazers 13 game win streak, they beat Golden State twice, Cleveland, OKC, UTA, Miami, all while lillard was posting some insane numbers.  


###All NBA 1st Team

*G James Harden* *G Damian Lillard* *F LeBron James* *F Anthony Davis* *C Joel Embiid*

So the big thing here is that I’m not cheating and putting Davis at center.  In previous years (like last) I put him as center, but he just didn’t play that this year and I would feel disingenuous having him there just so I could put Giannis in the 1st team.  Cousins was the center for most of the year and now Okafor (who is playing alright tbh) plays as center.  He’s a forward, and he earned the first team spot over the Freak and last years Finals MVP.  I covered the first 4 in the MVP section, and Embiid has been stunning on defense with plenty of offense to warrant this slot.  If I had some criticism for the 7 foot clown who is incredible at basketball its that I would have liked to see him more assertive on a nightly basis.  Too many games he took too many jumpers or simply not enough shots to be as good as he could have been.  Still, philly was sensational on defense and he had games where he completely annihilated some trash (see: lakers, los angeles), as well as games where he outplayed some of the leagues best (see block: westbrook, Russell). Honestly if there was one story line that I took from this year, it might be Embiid.  This dude can shoot, has plenty of post moves, is MASSIVE, and can take over games like few players in the league.  Just watch the all star game, he mattered, he made a difference and if it weren’t for LeBron doing LeBron things, he would have been the ASG MVP.  No one wants to see Philly in the playoffs because no one has an answer for Embiid.  

###All NBA 2nd Team

*G Victor Oladipo* *G Russell Westbrook* *F Giannis Antetokounmpo* *F Kevin Durant* *C Karl-Anthony Towns*

**Ok**, this is where is gets very interesting.  While the 1st team is quite easy for me this year, I genuinely feel bad about some of the players I left off.  Let’s start with Oladipo.  The pacers were the 7 seed in the east last year, lost their best offensive player and best defensive player and gained Oladipo.  Their pre season vegas over under win total was in the 30s and Oladipo brought them to one of the top seeds, over the wizards, over Giannis, and in incredible fashion.  What impressed me most of all was his defense and 3 point shooting.  Along with his penetration, passing and athleticism which make him a good player, Oladipo was one of the best defenders at his position all year, and shot over 35% from deep.  He led the league in steals and shot over 50% from 2 for the first time in his career.  He also had a pretty low Turnover% despite his massive up tick in usage.  He had basically identical stats to DeRozan, but was more efficient in both FG, and TS%.  Of all the non 1st team guards, I feel Oladipo is the only one that HAS to be on the ballot in one of the remaining 4 spots.  

**Westbrook** gets the second slot on the second team, and I’m reluctant to give it to him, but he played way more games than his competitors and put up enough stats.  He’s such a hard player to analyze.  I definitely think he’s one of the best 10 players in the league, but I watched him LOSE soooooooo many games for his team.  He got substantially more talent around him and a bunch of elite defensive players and it didn’t translate to wins and a good chunk of that I put on Westbrook.  But on the flipside, there were also plenty of games where the other team had absolutely 0 answer for him and he won the game by himself.  If either of my 3rd teamers had more games played I would try to convince myself to put them over him, but Westbrooks overall season value can’t be ignored.  

**Durant** doesn’t need much explanation.  He was incredibly efficient and played on a team that won a ton of games and is clearly a top 5 player.  His defense was at an all-time high, especially at the beginning of the year.  However, the technicals and ejections really did hurt his team, he missed some games with the rib injury, and Golden State generally underperformed this season so I have him on the 2nd team.  Boo hoo.  

**Giannis** I covered in the MVP section.  Along with his team record, the stats show he shouldn’t get a spot over the King or the Brow. https://i.imgur.com/Lv9FUQX.png  If you are putting Davis at center, I would put Giannis over Durant for 1st team.  

**At Center** I’m going with Towns.  There have been flashes this year of him being great, and he’s been incredibly efficient (.542/.341/.856).  His production is actually incredible given the small amount of FGAs, for which I blame/hate Thibs.  I wish he would be more aggressive and take more shots as he’s clearly the best offensive player on the team and there aren’t many teams in the league that have any kind of answer for him at all.  However, I’m not going to penalize him for Wiggins thinking he’s the GOAT or Thibs not running a better offense.  

###All NBA 3rd Team

*G Stephen Curry* *G Chris Paul* *F Jimmy Butler* *F LaMarcus Aldridge* *C Nikola Jokic*

**Ok** so the big controversy will be with the guards.  Here are the numbers https://i.imgur.com/m7PLdqO.png .  Now to me, I can see arguments for any combination of those 4 in the last two spots.  DeRozan totally fell off after the ASB and his numbers are by far the worst of that group, but the games played discrepancy is MASSIVE.  I put Curry because if he played even 15 more games he would have been on the 1st team, and Golden State was not as dominant without him.  Chris Paul was astoundingly impressive with his 3.53 ATO ratio and nearly identical WS/48 to curry.  The rockets were 47-7 with Paul and significantly less dominant without him, despite still having the MVP and a high caliber supporting cast.  He was also responsible for the second most points per game behind only curry of the group. Kyrie is a very tough leave off because of how efficient he was along with the team success.  However, as we’ve seen in the last few weeks, Boston can still win games against even the best teams.  This was the main reason I opted to leave him off. Again, of the first 4 guards and the 4 I compared statistically, I can see arguments for any combination of 6 out of those 8 with only Harden, Lillard and Oladipo being required.  

**For** the forward spots I’m totally cheating.  Butler played most of his minutes as SG and Aldridge at C, but I don’t care about how the play by play classifies them.  Butler is a wing and LaMarcus has the exact same game he always has.  I don’t really feel bad putting him at PF and Jokic at C.  

**Let’s** get Butler out of the way first.  When he played, Minnesota was on pace to win 50 games.  Last year they went 31-51.  Towns, although better, isn’t *that* much better than last year.  The coach is the same, the team is basically the same, Butler was the difference.  And although a tiny sample size, without Jimmy, the wolves are on a 32 win pace…almost identical to last year.  For someone to make that big of a difference, I have to put them on the all nba team.  Butler was also a great leader for this team.  He didn’t care about stats.  One night he would have 17 points, 5 steals and 7 assists if Towns was going off.  Other nights he’d score 30.  That’s exactly what kind of player you need on a team with a ton of talent, lots of mouths to feed and is young.  If he stayed healthy and Minnesota was in contention for the 3rd or 4th seed, I don’t think I could put him over Durant, but he would deserve at least some consideration.  Combine all this with him being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, he’s a no brainer. 

**Aldridge** is getting some love later in the year and rightfully so.  The Kawhaiisis and not having that great of a supporting cast weren’t ideal as far as situation goes and there were plenty of games Aldridge won by himself.  His defense is also by far the best it’s been in his career imo.  If you insist on putting him at center I could see an argument over towns, I just like how the teams look the way I slotted them in.  

**For Jokic**, here’s how he compares to his competitors at center.  https://i.imgur.com/mCY1KtE.png . I think Towns is kind of in a class by himself in this group, and Horford, although great I just can’t put him over Jokic or Gobert.  Jokic is god tier offense and Gobert is god tier defense.  In the end, Jokic played quite a few more games and all other things being equal, I think that gives him an edge.  Jokic had any number of 33-15-12 games and did a whole lot for the nuggets offense which currently ranks 9th in FG%, 4th in 3p% and 5th in assists.  

Players that were extremely tough to leave off: Kyrie, DeRozan, Gobert, Horford

Players that got at least some consideration: Steven Adams, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Clint Capela, CJ McCollum, Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell, Lou Williams, Andre Drummond, Kemba Walker

###Defensive Player of the Year

**1. Anthony Davis**

This was an extremely tough year between Davis, Embiid, and Gobert.  Both the Jazz and the 6ers had better defenses than the Pelicans, and Davis did have Jrue playing good defense, but the Pels are remarkably worse with him off the floor.  He led the league in blocked shots and was great around the rim and on the perimeter.  One of the reasons I put him 1st is that I feel he could make a similar defensive impact on any team in the NBA.  Put gobert on a team that already has a Deandre Jordan type guy and I’m not sure he could be quite as effective.  With Davis, I feel like you can put him anywhere on the court and he just terrifies the offense.  It’s often funny watching guards go into the paint with davis on the floor.  They don’t often go to the basket, they quite frequently get to the elbow, see the Brow, then start moving laterally and take a leaning fader just so as not to get their shit blocked into the 8th row.  I think he has the best and quickest hands on defense of the 3 and he played the most games.  Honestly, between these three its so close I really have to go off eye test.  I mean, Davis is first in Defensive Win shares, but last in DBPM of the 3, he has the most steals and blocks but is last in rebound percentage and his team had the worst defense of the 3.  

**2. Rudy Gobert**

Gobert had almost 1 fewer foul per 36 than Embiid, and a higher block percentage, steal percentage and an almost identical rebound percentage.  His DBPM is drastically higher and he played fewer games than embiid, but it’s not that great of a difference in games played.  The biggest reason I put gobert ahead of embiid is that Utah was 12-15 without him.  Gobert doesn’t do much for the offense so that massive gap in winning percentage with vs without him in the western conference is due to his defense.  The Jazz are currently 3rd in the league in opponents points per 100 and while philly is 17th.  

**3. Joel Embiid**

I could see Embiid winning this award and would have no problem with it.  The nerdy guy I don’t like that much on the Dunc’d on podcast has picked him as the DPOY over every quarter this year.  He is a terror at the rim but also a terror on the perimeter.  He’s surprisingly nimble and I went to one Philly game this year and he’s fucking **HUGE**.  He fouls maybe a tiny bit too much and Philly down the stretch has been strong (albeit playing the leagues garbage dump) along with the small differences in the advanced stats I mentioned are the tiny nitpicks on why he’s 3rd and not 1st.  Overall, I think it’s absolutely a 3 man race especially with Roberson going down earlier.  I thought PG was the best perimeter defender this year, but these 3 make a bigger impact on the game defensively and that’s why they’re the top 3.   


###All defensive 1st team

*Danny Green* *Marcus Smart* *Paul George* *Anthony Davis* *Joel Embiid*

###All defensive 2nd team

*Victor Oladipo* *Jimmy Butler* *Giannis Antetokoumpo* *Draymond Green* *Rudy Gobert*

**I guess** playing in San Antonio is why Danny Green doesn’t get enough credit, but damn he is so good.  San Antonio has the 6th best opposing FG% and the 5th best opposing 3-point FG%.  And let me tell you, parker and ginobili are not the reason for that.  Aldridge has been great as well, and while being less athletic than a paralyzed hippopotamus, Pau Gasol actually has pretty good rim protection numbers.  With Kawhi out, Danny picks up the best opposing wing a large amount of the time and I give him credit by putting him on the first team.

**Marcus Smart** is absolutely incredible on defense and is perfectly suited to this era as he can play great D on 4s and 5s in a pinch.  That’s probably the difference maker on why he made 1st vs 2nd team.  His ability to not only lock down a guard, but also very much annoy and do a good job on bigs if need be is a highly sought after skill and it shows in Boston’s incredible defense this year.  If there was a 3rd team all defense I almost certainly would have put Jaylen Brown and Horford on there, but I think smart was the best defender and was very close to putting JB and Al on the 2nd team.  

**Paul George** was the best perimeter defender for most of the year.  The thing about PG is he plays both styles of defense at a high level.  What I mean by that is when playing your man on the perimeter, you can basically approach it both ways.  You can get really up close and basically harass them, poking at the ball, constantly changing position, or you can stay in between the basket.  The 1st way leads to more steals and is “sexier,” but the 2nd way is just as effective, you basically try to beat your opponent to the spot they want to get to.  George is very good at both and with jimmy missing quite a few games and Kawhi out, I thought he was the best perimeter defender this year.  Giannis has a higher ceiling with his 38 meter wing span, but his defensive IQ isn’t quite as good yet.  His offense has been quite bad and that’s why he didn’t sniff an all-NBA spot, but I think the defensive 1st team is warranted.  

*For davis, embiid and gobert see the DPOY section.*  

**Oladipo** replaced Paul George as the Pacers’ best defender and holy cow this surprised me even more than his 3 point shooting.  I guess it shouldn’t be that much of a surprise given his body and his athleticism, but I was shocked he would be *this* good on defense. The pacers had an elite 3P% defense and was 3rd in causing turnovers per 100 possessions and Oladipo leading the league in steals was a big part of that.  

**Jimmy Butler** was a no brainer to make one of the teams, especially with Kawhi not playing at all this year.  He missed quite a few games so I’m putting him on the 2nd team, and while Jaylen Brown got serious consideration for this spot, I thought Butler did so much more for Minnesota’s defense.  The wolves were dead last in FG% and 2P% but *only* 21st in 3 P% and 5th in causing turnovers per 100.  Despite a trash defense, I thought Butler did as good a job as you could ask for, especially considering that he and Taj Gibson are the only players that consistently played the slightest bit of defense this year.  If you were to give this spot to Horford or Brown to reward Boston, I wouldn’t have a big problem.  

**Giannis** is at times, jaw droppingly good on the defensive end of the floor. He’s gotten much stronger and with his wingspan, he can consume opponents with his shadow alone.   There were plenty of moments where you watch him and youre like, “yeah, that guy is still just 24 and doesn’t 100% know what hes doing” but most of the time you’re like “Jesus Christ, trying to go by that guy is my worst nightmare!”  The Bucks didn’t really have a stellar defense this year, but I blame that on the “coaching” staff.  In most years, Giannis could make the 1st team and most certainly will in the future, but for now, I’m putting him on the second team despite his defensive “ceiling” being higher than PG.  

**Draymond** has been fat, out of shape, hungover, ejected, and overall underwhelming this year.  And he’s still on my 2nd team.  He just does so many things for that team, who had a pretty good defense again this year.   He can still guard nearly anyone in the NBA and switch on anyone, block Dennis smith at the rim, then guard the best bigs in the league later in the week.  I almost left him off, but he is unassailably one of the best 10 defenders in the league so I gave him this spot over the two aforementioned Celtics.  

Really tough players to leave off: Horford, Jaylen Brown, Steven Adams, Roberson, Aldridge, Covington, Jrue Holiday

Players that got some consideration: Ben Simmons, Clint Capela, LMAM, Ariza, Tucker, Nurkic, James Johnson, Kevin Durant, Lowry, Klay


###Rookie of the Year

**1. Donovan Mitchell**

It’s him vs Simmons and they both deserve it.  If I had it my way all the voters would collude and agree that exactly half would vote for each so they are guaranteed to get co rookies of the year.  It was deserved in 94 with Hill and Kidd and its deserved now.  Gun to my head, I have to go with Mitchell because he’s in the western conference, is a true rookie, was relied more on in crunch time to make a basket, and was the best player on his team this year.  Gobert helped a ton defensively, as did Embiid, but Embiid could generate offense by himself while Gobert couldn’t.  I had the Jazz out of the playoffs before the year (RIP grizzlies), and Mitchell propelled them to a top 4 seed in the west.  Simmons is probably the better player and my guess would be he has the better individual career, but if I *had* to pick one for rookie of the year I’m taking Donovan.  

**2. Ben Simmons**

Great BBIQ, great passing, unselfishness, defense, energy, there really isn’t much more you could ask for from Simmons this year.  It’s not his fault he’s not the best player on his team and it’s not his fault Utah lost Hayward to Boston and Gobert for a reasonable chunk of the year, but it’s these tiny things that are the difference makers.  His triple doubles are impressive, but to me the most impressive aspect of his rookie year was his defense.  He was able and willing to guard multiple positions night in night out, which historically, just isn’t something rookies do.  He doesn’t have a jump shot, but I could care less.  As long as he has shooters around him the offense will hum.  It’s really hard to run an offense in the NBA and he stepped in seamlessly.  This is one of the better rookie campaigns of the last 20 years and he deserves a massive amount of credit.  He also has an Australian accent so if you wanna give him ROY just for that I can’t blame you.  

**3. Jayson Tatum**

Tatum has an array of offensive moves already and is an excellent shooter.  He had a bit of a slump (rookie wall or “I just had a baby” wall) but being such an integral part of a top 2 seed in the eastern conference cannot be ignored.  He probably wins ROY 7 years out of 10, but for 2018, he’ll have to settle for 3rd.  

###Most Improved Player

**1. Victor Oladipo**

Not much to say here that hasn’t already been said.  This should be a unanimous award.

**2. Joe Ingles**

MIP is a tough award as its hard to see a difference between actually improving as  a player, or simply getting a better opportunity.  I used per 36 numbers for most of my comparisons even though I typically hate per36.  The minutes difference is just too much and its still a player vs themselves comparison so this is one of the few times I find it appropriate.  I chose not to put any sophmores in MIP as nearly every rookie improves, often stoutly.  If I did, I would have voted for Jaylen Brown and either Brandon Ingram or Jamal Murray.  But on to Ingles.  The reason he gets 2nd on this ballot is because despite an uptick in usage and roll/minutes, his efficiency improved across the board.  Jingle McCringleberry improved his FG, eFG, FT, 3p, and TS percentages from last season.  Here’s a comparison to some other MIP candidates. https://i.imgur.com/w0sPWW3.png .  To be on a top 4/5 seed in the west and improve your volume *and* efficiency is extremely tough to do.  He’s also everyone’s favorite player, so here is Joe Ingles, 2018 MIP runner up.  

**3. Spencer Dinwiddie**

This was a really tough choice between him and Capela.  Capela improved his rebounding and shot blocking, led the league in FG% and was a fantastic defender this year.  However, this award is not for best player, it’s for most improved. Despite his decrease in efficiency in every part of his game, Dinwiddie was 6th in total assists this year, and had an incredible ATO ratio.  My reservations about putting him on here was that he could be a good stats bad team guy, which I generally don’t reward, but despite not being efficient, he adds value to the team and his advanced metrics have improved.  



###Coach of the Year

**1. Brad Stevens**

Coach of the year is hard to vote on.  Is it best system? Best record? Best job with a subpar cast?  Coach you would most want for your playoff team? Who knows.  All I know is there’s no fucking way you can be in contention for the top seed while getting 60/164 games from your top 2 players.  Stevens developed this team to be incredible on the defensive end of the floor and racked up a win streak, wins against the best teams, and a stunning road record.  On top of all of this, I believe there are only 4 players that were on the roster last year!  This was Casey’s award up until a few weeks ago, but the wizardry of this youthful basketball savant cannot be ignored.   

**2. Dwane Casey**

I left DeRozan off the all-NBA team because I give most of the credit for Toronto’s success to their improved coaching, system and bench play.  Nobody had the Raptors winning as many games as the Warriors this year, and to completely change their style of play and be elite on offense and defense (until the last 3 weeks), is incredibly hard to pull off.  We all have our reservations about the little dinosaurs, but Casey deserves a huge amount of credit for what he did this year.  

**3. Mike D’Antoni**

I’m not seeing many people voting for PringlesBro, and I’m not sure why.  It’s really hard to make two ball dominant players work together (see Brooks, Scott circa 2012-2015).  But D’Antoni turned two Harden and Paul into the best backcourt in the NBA.  Their playstyle is hard to watch, but even harder to defend.  No one had them being 6 games ahead of the warriors with the 1 seed locked up by April 1st.   


Coaches that got serious consideration: Snyder, Stotts, Pop



###Sixth Man of the Year

**1. Lou Williams**

This should be another unanimous award, Lou put a trash team on his back and kept them in playoff contention until the very end, despite losing CP3 and Blake.  His 50 point dicking he slapped on the Warriors sealed the award up imo.  

**2. Nikola Mirotic**

This year, Mirotic was traded from the bulls for being too good and made massive contributions to the Pelicans without Boogie.  Seriously, you have to put the man on the ballot.  HE WAS TRADED FOR BEING TOO GOOD AT BASKETBALL!  He had an 18.3 PER and averaged nearly 18/10 per 36 for New Orleans.  Down the stretch he has been huge especially with his 28 points on 6/11 from 3 in their win in Oracle.  

**3. Jordan Clarkson**

Clarkson didn’t really miss a beat switching teams mid season.  His percentages went up a bit when he went to Cleveland which is no surprise (.458/.392/.804).  From watching Clarkson, even though he seems to have an “all I do is score” mentality, I really like him on the floor.  He can create off the dribble and knock down tough shots, he’s not afraid of the moment and always brings the energy.    

Note that I restricted my 6th men to starting a maximum of 20 games, so other quality candidates such as Will Barton did not qualify.  


###All Rookie Teams

**1st Team**

*Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Kyle Kuzma, Bam Adebayo*

**2nd Team**

*Lonzo Ball, Lauri Markkanen, ~~Frank Ntilikina~~, Josh Jackson, OG Anunoby, John Collins*

Honestly, Im 5500 words in and don’t feel these need much justification.  No one really cares about 2nd team all rookie.  Good job I guess.

.

.

Well there you have it, hope you made it all the way through, let me know what you agree/disagree with. 


Edit: Josh Jackson over Frank seems pretty universal so I'll say I was wrong on that one. As far as ROY, please at least read the post. I said they should be co winners. The biggest reasons I voted for Donovan were his crunch time scoring, a top 4 seed in a tough western conference, and he was the best player on his team. As far as other selections, as I stated, some were VERY difficult decisions. Derozan and kyrie could be as high as 2nd team and I would have no problem with it. Horford and brown were close to making all defensive and DPOY was a 3 way coin flip. I'm sorry if my picks weren't the same as yours or I didn't vote for your team, but I think I provided ample justification for my selections.",0.49,controversial,4/9/18 19:16

How can a player who shot 19 times, mostly in the paint, only have one FTA, but another player who only shot 3 times within the arc have 15 FTA? The foul-baiting works great for him, but it makes him an absolute unbearable star to watch/appreciate. I think he's got MVP this year if he doesn't slow down but I can't imagine cheering for that playstyle.

Overall, the Nuggets had 60 points in the paint and shot 21 free throws (more than 10 in the second half), while the Rockets had 32 points in the paint and shot 34 free throws (almost all in the first half).

He's putting up his usual raw scoring / assist numbers, but he's doing it on a scorching 64% true shooting and is currently having the best season **of all time** in terms of assist/turnover ratio, and has the Clippers at 3rd right now in offensive rating. I'm not a fan of holistic stats but if you do he's thriving by all metrics: he's first in both WS and WS/48, his PER is 27.7 and he's 3rd in OBPM and 4th in VORP.

Yet in nba.com's MVP ladder, he's not only absent from any of the ten spots, he doesn't even get an honorable mention! Klay Thompson and Paul Millsap are on that list ahead of him! He's also only rarely mentioned in the MVP discussion on this sub or the other NBA forums I frequent, and usually as an afterthought. What gives, /r/nba? I know people love to fetishize scoring and people are going to (wrongly) penalize Paul for not giving you 20ppg, but to me MVP is a three-man race by now between Curry, Gasol, and Paul, and the idea that anyone could have him not only outside the top 5, but the top *fifteen* is absolutely absurd to me. Of the 3-4 Clips games I watched he's been consistently fantastic, so unless the selection of games I watched was incredibly disproportionate this isn't a case of the numbers lying, either. LAC is 13-5, Paul is playing incredibly, he's been the consensus 3rd best player in the league for years... why have we suddenly forgotten about him completely?

401,Are Kawhi & Paul George bigger snakes than Kevin Durant?,18,ca063h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ca063h/are_kawhi_paul_george_bigger_snakes_than_kevin/,114,1562484433,"Obviously, they're all being viewed as snake.

However, not every snake is created equal.

I believe Kawhi & PG13 are bigger snakes than KD and here's why...


**Kevin Durant:** He left OKC to Warriors after losing to them despite being up 3-1. However, KD was a free agent and Warriors convinced him to join them after their meeting at Hampton.

How to get upvoted/downvoted -

1. “  5’9” Shaq “ - For some reason this sub doesn’t really know how to use the upvote and downvote button so you’re in luck, post this anywhere even if it’s out of context and you’re bound to get upvotes.

2. Stroke the popular opinions ego- Even if you don’t agree with the opinion, you must always go with the popular narrative that is currently being spewed. This sub isn’t open to discussion, that is how you get downvoted.

3. “Lol” - This ones tricky, if you use this in the wrong context people will automatically downvote because they think you’re making fun of said opinions. Use wisely, preferably for outlandish takes. 

4. “(Blank) and it’s not even close” - This phrase isn’t liked by a majority of the community, if you use it, use it for concrete facts. Try not to use it when discussing players of similar caliber cause you’ll get downvoted. 

5. Talking about Lebron being bad/good- This will either get you a lot of downvotes or some upvotes depending on which side of the coin you choose. This subs kind of bipolar so careful.

6. “It’s not too late to delete this” - For when people say some stupid takes. It’s easy upvotes if you choose the takes to use it on carefully. 

7. “Nephew” - This term is used for when  someone can’t figure out an argument to say back to the person that they’re calling a nephew. So instead they resort to name calling. Will usually get upvotes. 

8. Know your context and stick with it - You need to pick and choose your battles, calling (blank) trash on a (blank) highlight reel/ appreciation post probably isn’t the smartest thing to do. 


If you wanna voice your opinion about a player, perhaps try a different sub. This one usually doesn’t allow for open opinions unless it fits the current narrative.",0.51,controversial,8/13/19 22:59

What's the thing you believe, but deep-down acknowledge is totally disrespectful and worthy of derision? Let it all out. 

I'll start:

Kobe Bryant was nothing more than glorified DeMar DeRozan. He was a very gifted mid-range scorer and athlete, who benefitted from being in the right place in the right time, playing with Shaq and having Phil Jackson as a coach. His 08 MVP and 10 FMVP are total farces and his legacy is bolstered by these undeserved awards.

NBA players today would fare *much much better* in the past than players from the past would today. The athletes today are bigger, stronger, and faster than they were before. Wings like Lebron, KD, Giannis and Kawhi are all nearly the same size as even the most intimidating bigs like Bill Laimbeer. They would adapt to the physicality of the league and, with their combination of speed and strength, become totally unfair. It's pointless to compare players across eras in terms of how good they were at basketball (today's players are clearly better than any other era) and instead compare them by how they performed relative to the rest of the league.

All it takes is one guy to spill the beans -- in a modern world in which spilling the beans is easier than it's ever been, and gets easier every day -- and your whole brand implodes. Bye bye NBA. For what? An *arguably* more marketable Finals? Wouldn't it make more sense to dedicate all the time and resources something like this would take to, I dunno, a marketing team that can adequately hype up the clash of the two best teams in the NBA? 

2. If it's a rig, it's the most ham-fisted rig in the history of rigging. Anybody with Sportscenter within shouting distance knows that the officiating in the NBA this playoffs has been a complete joke. Why would the NBA *intentionally* sacrifice the credibility of the Finals to... make the Finals more interesting? 

3. There's easier, more subtle ways to rig games that don't **literally** have an official system in place (replay) to scrutinize every decision made by the people trying to rig. Ever heard of bribing people? ""Hey, Chris Paul! If you give up a bunch of turnovers this game we'll make sure you get a ring next year!"" Boom. Simple. Clippers lose, people yell at Chris Paul for choking, he gets to redeem himself next year. Better narrative, less risk, fewer moving parts... And I thought of that in, like, 5 minutes.

I don't know how many people seriously think these are rigs or not, but it seems like a prevalent enough sentiment that I got sick of addressing it on a comment-to-comment basis.

So as the story goes essentially all of Kawhi's defensive metrics (RPM, defensive on/off, tracking dEFG%, synergy sports metrics) have [slipped](http://i.imgur.com/ge618Ee.png) hard this season. While Occam's razor gives us a simple explanation for that - his defense has slipped somewhat - many people on this sub like to throw out, without any critical evaluation, this [piece](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/) by Matt Moore in Kawhi's defense. The piece alleges that opposing teams' offenses take the best wing player on the opposing team who is being guarded by Kawhi out of their offense to play 4 on 4 against a bunch of ""bad defenders"" like Gasol or Parker.

There are a few things wrong with the piece.

1) It gives out its conclusion almost at the start:

*""After all, we know Leonard is a great defender.""* 

and

*All this suggests that it is not Leonard's teammates who are dragging him down, but the other way around. If you want at least some variation of a bottom line, in individual defense, Leonard is only 53rd percentile via Synergy Sports. He was 86th percentile last season.

So we've reached an impasse. We know Leonard is an elite defender. We know he's still locking up whoever he is facing. So how do we explain these numbers, the somewhat small sample size notwithstanding?*

- and then it sets out to prove it. That's of course circular reasoning which isn't something you would want to employ while trying to prove something.

2) The evidence is flimsy. The article shows 11 possessions from 3 games as an evidence of teams avoiding Kawhi. The problem of course is that you can't generalize those few videos on the whole season, unless you want me to generalize stuff like [this](https://vine.co/v/5QJgL7rviBj) on a whole season too. The opposing teams practice for 5 on 5. Players like LeBron or Durant don't take themselves out of the offenses that are built around them because of Kawhi. No teams do that. That's an asinine assumption proven wrong by the eye test.

If you watch the Spurs games, it becomes pretty clear that the opposing offenses are not avoiding Kawhi. In fact per nba.com's Defense tracking he is defending 9.2 FGAs per game this season as opposed to 9.4 FGAs last season in what is essentially the same number of minutes per game so you can't really claim that the offenses are avoiding him. The difference? Last year his opponents shot 5.6% lower than their season averages on those shots defended by Kawhi, while this season the only shoot 1.3% lower.

3) The piece tries to wiggle around with various line-up explanations but it ultimately fails to prove why the Spurs defense gets so much better without Kawhi on the floor and with those purported ""bad defensive"" players still on the floor. Do teams suddenly start playing 5 on 5? Shouldn't the reincorporation of their best wing into offense result in a better offense, especially if a worse defender that Kawhi has subbed in for him? The opposite happens though, the offenses get 9 points worse. This causes the whole piece to essentially fall apart.

So I maintain that Kawhi's defense has actually declined somewhat. It's still pretty good and will probably be back to its usual level in the playoffs, but it's not on the DPOY level of the previous few years like some people still claim. I'll try to give some reasons:

1) More offensive responsibilities - this one is pretty clear. Just like the Spurs defense gets better without Kawhi, their offense goes down by pretty much the same margin. Kawhi is taking 3 more shots per game than last years and overall has a far bigger role on the offensive side. He also, at least to me, seems to be isoing a little bit more than he used to and that can really take your strenght.

2) Timmy D's retirement - I would say that having a good rim protector can make a wing defender look better than they actually are (far more than the other way around) because it allows them to play closer to the ball handlers and contest their jumpshots better, knowing that the ball handler will be reluctant to drive into a good rim protector who can contain the blow-by. We have seen this with PG and Roy Hibbert when he was good for those 2 seasons. And I think we have see it with Kawhi and Timmy D too.

Timmy was of course an elite rim protector even in his later years and he could've probably won 2 DPOYs over the last 4 years without anyone being able to say anything about it. Having him behind you to cover your ass really helped a lot. Timmy is the guy who slowed down LeBron in those 2013 Finals, not Kawhi or Diaw, because LeBron feared driving into Timmy. Elite guys like LeBron or KD don't really even look at their primary defender, they mainly concern themselves with what the help defense is doing.

Without Timmy Kawhi was getting a little bit exposed, but his defensive metrics have started to rebound (they were worse than they are now at the time of Moore's piece) with the emergence of Dedmon as a solid rim protector. The question then of course is to whom do you attribute this improvement.

Of course I can be wrong and Kawhi's defense is as good as ever. In that case I maintain that the Moore article does a poor job of showing that.",0.52,controversial,3/4/17 11:50

First off, I'd like to say two disclaimers: 1) this isn't to trash on Ingram, it's more of a ""tell me why I'm wrong (or right)' post, and 2) I'm a Celtics fan, but I'm not trying to be biased against a Lakers player.

Anyway, I just want to know what scouts saw in him. I agree that he has potential, and it's unfair to judge him solely on his rookie season in terms of what type of player he'll develop into- but what does he have that about a half dozen other young players don't? I just don't see what makes him ""special"", I guess. I think he's obviously a first round NBA prospect that I would not be surprised if he blossoms into a good, or even great player. But what made him such a more highly regarded player than Jamal Murray or Jaylen Brown or even someone older like Buddy Hield or Malcolm Brogdon?

And I get that youth is in his favor. But there's other 19 year olds that seem to be on his talent level. He just seems like he'd be a hit or miss mid-first rounder that I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up being a legit player or ended up being a career bench warmer. If I said that, for example, Malik Beasley or Malachi Richardson or Timothe Luwawu-Cabbarot were struggling then nobody would bat an eye, and sort of write them off as players that probably won't make it. But it seems that Ingram gets the benefit of the doubt just because he was drafted number 2, and he's getting minutes (and he's probably getting those based on where they drafted him).

He doesn't seem to have any elite skills, and has a glaring weakness (being weak, in fact). So, people who know him more than I do: what makes Brandon Ingram special?",0.53,controversial,2/15/17 16:47

AD can do basically everything. Embiid is a monster when healthy and actually being utilized. Kp is a scoring machine. A guy like Drummond can get you 20 and 15 every night.

But the one thing none of these guys really do is pass. They can pass if they need to, but they aren't looking to do it. 

The modern NBA is all about guards and forwards playing around the perimeter. Whenever a center or power forward who is the size of a center gets the ball, they are usually looking for their shot. 

AD, for all of his skill, rarely kicks the ball back out to a shooter when he gets doubled he just keeps working his shot unless he gets in trouble and has to give it up. 

But Jokic is different. He may not be as good as AD when it comes to scoring, but he actually looks to pass. He is very good at it too. He someone cuts, he will hit them with a bounce pass. If he gets doubled, he finds the open man. 

Give him a great second guy who is a perimeter player and I think you have the only lineup featuring a big that can lead to a championship.

He’s never complained, always embraced his role, and done everything in his power to improve the team comraderie and chemistry since he’s been in Toronto. While other veteran players may act entitled to playing time, Lin has been the consummate professional and teammate the entire year (and his entire career). 

It’s amazing to see Lin finally be close to getting his ring after coming from humble beginnings and going through all the trials and tribulations early in his career to get to this point. Hopefully if and when the Raptors clinch, Lin can be on the floor to be able to soak it in when the moment finally comes.

It then occurred to me that maybe that's the biggest polarizing thing about this season to people: the stats are there but the results aren't always. I think I tended to accept it in the sense that it's basically just Westbrook out there and the numbers were so insane that I didn't care

But it felt rough to see him get the triple double season in a game where they lost by so much because it just reinforces how his critics feel

What he has done this season is once in a lifetime (I don't think we see another session like this for a while because of workload on a player) and I think it stinks to achieve it in a game where it could only give his critics more fire

MVP candidate, Triple Double Machine, Favourite son and apprentice of legends His Airness Michael ""Goat"" Jordan and Kobe ""Mamba"" ""Bryant, King of the Prairie, and unwitting pawn to bad publicity. 

Now I'm sure you've heard varying opinions on him, that he's a ball hog, ran KD out of OKC, the reason why OKC's dynasty fell through and a whole other bunch of fecal matter that people throw around like monkies. 

But is he really? First we have to know and understand his back story like the norm for all super heroes. 

Drafted as a defensive specialist with the 4th pick and considered a reach by most at the time and moved from his natural position of SG to PG this young guy with a chip on his shoulder trying to make it for both him and his dead friend had the unwanted pressure of adapting to a new role while trying to adapt to the nba.

Shouldering the blame of most of his teams bad publicity and mistakes, the young floor general along with his brothers in arm make it to the 2012 finals only to lose due to inexperience and LeBron James will to get his first ring. At the ages of 21 and 22 after trading James ""I need that 5mill"" Harden, the dynamic duo of Westbrook and Durant were expected to lead to a dynasty winning at least  1 to 3 rings during the decade. What went wrong? Was it really ball hogging? 

2013: they win 60 games and are favourites to win it that year, until Westbrook gets injured during the first round and misses half of the 2014 season.

2015: Durant goes down, thunder misses the playoffs by one game and people get a glimpse into the possibility that is westbrook.  Trying his best to will a team not built for him to a high standard he falls short.

2016: With the team finally healthy for the first time since 2013 playoffs and under new coaching leadership the OKC thunder over perform and find themselves up 3-1 in the WCF. We all know what happened so let's just fast forward a couple months.

having resigned and showing signs of loyalty to his team who have raised him since he was 19. The competitor proceeds to deliver a historic season willing his team to a playoff spot after preseason expectations were for him to go off and miss/barely make the playoffs. But still even amongst the respect put forward by players and coaches Westbrook is met with detractors trying to downplay his accomplishments.

Here, we have a 6'3"" PG drafted as a defensive specialist leading the league in scoring at 31ppg, 10.5rbs, 10.5ast.

With his team in the middle or a retool/rebuild he has his team sitting at a record of 42-31 after initial expectations were a losing record and a postseason being ""if they're lucky"". After reaching the WCF last year, his years team consist of 5 players who see minutes on the floor who have any playoff experience. 

Outside of Taj, Kanter and Westbrook all other rotation players are still on rookie contracts and they are fielding 3 rookies (one who started for most of the year). None of these rookies are top 10 picks either.

Outside of westbrook these 14 other players collectively boast a whopping 9 seasons averaging over 10.0ppg. And kanter and dipo are responsible for 6 of the 9. 

Now, dipo has missed 13 games, kanter has missed 10, and Adams was playing injured for around the first 30 games of the season. OK you say.. who cares? players miss games all the time. True... but other than the rookies these were the only players who had any off season training camp with westbrook. The rest of his team arrived during the season. 

The context is important when it comes to speaking about westbrook whether negatively  or positively. With limited offensive options the effect these have not being in the game is excruciating when it comes to notching wins. Now I'm not saying that with these guys being healthy that they would have 10-30 more wins, but maybe just maybe if you think about it, considering that his competition in the MVP race is only up 8 wins and 4 more wins would have them in the 4th seed,  you can't discount the possibilities of the context provided. 

Maybe someone can provide insight on other teams in the league whose roster consists of rookie contract players and see where they stand in the big picture because to me what westbrook is doing with what's been given to him is nothing short of amazing. After all, this is the Nba, where westbrook happens! and I think his detractors really need to take a step back and show some appreciation for the leagues MVP.",0.5,controversial,3/28/17 22:25
425,"Honest questions regarding ""The Kick"" and the relevance of intent",0,4kqio1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4kqio1/honest_questions_regarding_the_kick_and_the/,72,1464070170,"When Draymond's shot to Adam's crotch first happened, the narrative was largely that Draymond tried to injure Adams in a fit of immaturity and classlessness. Even as a Warriors fan, I bought into this narrative, as I saw no other reason for his leg to do that on the play. It seemed he should be suspended.

Today the internet is flooded with [videos of other scenarios in which Draymond does the same kick on the finish](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFw0ls6oC36/), but in the absence of opponents' nuts. In my opinion, these videos go a long way to support the argument that the kick was unintentional, and that Adams's balls were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. Whether you still believe it was intentional or not, the r/nba narrative has also shifted to account for these videos. The story is no longer ""Draymond is dirty,"" and now reads ""intent shouldn't matter."" This, I can understand. If reckless movements are condoned on the court just because they are consistent, then there is nothing preventing actually dirty players from repeatedly flailing around and secretly hoping to occasionally cause injury or start fights.

However, if we throw intent out the window, then what distinguishes Draymond's kick from something like Westbrook's kick [here](https://gfycat.com/FairImpoliteIberianmole) or [here](https://gfycat.com/UnacceptableSelfishElephant)? It looks like Westbrook needlessly catches a sack in both gifs. Before today, I would have said the difference was intent. Westbrook was at worst trying to create separation between himself and Duncan in the first gif. In the second gif, it looks like he's desparately seeking a 4-point play. No intent there. But now Draymond's play might just be a bad flopping habit, and intent apparently doesn't matter anyways.

Is it that Adams went down to the ground and played less minutes, whereas Duncan was only momentarily in pain, and West seemed not to mind? In other words, is the degree of the injury relevant in this decision?

Is the argument that Westbrook's kicks were more natural than Draymond's? Is ""natural"" a binary classification for the NBA? Or are there various degrees of ""natural""?

I read some justifications of Dahntay Jones's suspension that cited his ""reputation"" as a dirty player. Is this actually something the NBA considers? And if so, who decides what this reputation is for Draymond or Westbrook? I feel that Draymond's reputation might have affected the extent to which this play blew up.

Anyways, I'm wondering in which ways this Draymond kick is unique to similar kicks if intention plays no part. I think any of the arguments I mentioned above could be made into valid arguments, and I'm interested to see what people have to say.",0.47,controversial,5/23/16 23:09

It sounds like a hot take, but it’s not. 

It’s the modern NBA, not 1980. Big men who can’t shoot, can’t assist, and (as it pertains to defense) CAN’T GUARD ANYONE BUT 4s AND 5s (AKA GOBERT), are not what you want as a franchise cornerstone.

Gobert regularly gets yanked in close games against teams that can space the floor and shoot.  I remember in the playoffs when Snyder had him sitting on the bench for crucial stretches against the Rockets. He only played 30 MPG against the Rockets in the playoffs last year, and the Jazz were often better with Derrick Favors at the 5 instead of him.

The playoffs are when you have your stars playing 36+ every game. But not Rudy, his coach can’t bare to play him more than 30 per. What good are you as a defensive player if you are unplayable in crunch time AGAINST ANY SINGLE TEAM? Imagine calling yourself the DPOY when you are flat out a negative contributor against elite teams.

Gobert is a bottom feeder, plain and simple! Can feast on teams with terrible spacing like the Knicks, but is useless or mid against actually good teams in the playoffs. **It’s why the Jazz never do anything in the playoffs despite having great regular season records.**


Gobert is

•	⁠66th in PPG (averaging fewer points than Serge Ibaka)

•	⁠167th in APG (fewer than Daniel Theis despite averaging 12 more MPG)

•	⁠2nd in RPG to Andre Drummond. Go ask Andre Drummond (new address: piss & concrete (sorry CLE bros but i had to)) how much rebounding meant to Detroit. He was literally traded for filler and a second round pick.

He’s a terrible scorer with no post moves who can’t shoot. He can’t pass whatsoever (averaging 1.2 APG).

All he can do is

* rebound

* catch lobs

* play paint defense

Oh shit, where have we seen this before? Oh right, DeANDRE JORDAN. A guy that casuals overrated *FOR YEARS* before he got dumped like a box of bricks from the Mavs and people realized that NBA GMs didn’t value him at all.

Like I feel like I’m watching a completely different player than everyone else. This dude is not a star. **He wins DPOYs because people still have an archaic mindset that DPOYs are people who block shots and protect the paint. WRONG. DPOYs should be people who stop shots from even occurring, forcing passes (look at Kawhi’s defense when he won it)**,

That’s where we felt we had the best chance to score.” Throwing shade at Harden & his defense. 

As we all know, James Harden prevented Giannis, Embiid, & Siakam from scoring and played excellent post defense. In fact, James Harden was so good on post up defense that he is currently ranked in the 95th percentile allowing only 26.8% FG% against him.

This can easily be cast aside as the “James Harden plays bad defense” narrative going into Giannis head. Which I understand, however Giannis also threw shade at Harden during his All Star Game Draft.

Giannis chose Kemba Walker over James Harden claiming he wanted someone who would “Pass the ball” 

Harden is currently averaging 7.3 Assists Per Game
Kemba is averaging 5.0 assists per game

Another fact Giannis seemed to ignore, but wait.. there’s even more shade!

Before selecting either Harden or Walker, Giannis stated he wanted the “Crossover Killer, Step-Back Master” things Harden is obviously known for with his step-back 3 & crossovers (sorry Rubio fans). He then went on to choose Kemba Walker over Harden throwing shade at him as well.

Now, many of you will say I’m thinking too much into this and that it isn’t that serious. That these are all just coincidences and jokes. However, I have one final piece of evidence.

Last year, Giannis threw a pass that eventually hit Harden in the head pretty hard. When looking back at it, he threw this pass extremely hard & fast at someone in the corner Harden was guarding. This hit Harden in the head, Giannis rebounded the ball, and didn’t even seem to care or think about what he did to Harden and continued to play. Most people brushed this off as an accident, i did too (as a rockets fan) however some are speculating Giannis did this on purpose and actually hates/dislikes Harden.

Well, I happened to have read Loose Balls before I read Book of Basketball, and I remember clearly, George Mikan did not forget about the check, he just ignored his colleagues demand to show Kareem the check in the first meeting.  You see, Kareem made it clear that he wasn't going to get into a back and forth negotiation. He was going to take whatever the bigger first offer was. And George Mikan, I suppose, just didn't believe him. He told his colleagues afterwards that he was going to show it to him at the next meeting, which of course, never transpired, much to the chagrin of his colleagues - which was also the beginning of the end for George Mikan as the ABA commisioner. 


&nbsp;



Small little detail, right? Bill Simmons just changed it slightly to make George Mikan appear more brainless.  Well, that's fine and dandy for one small thing, however - 


&nbsp;



The question it raises for me is - What else did he change in that book?  What other fact did he omit or change in order to rewrite basketball history?  It puts the integrity of the whole book, AND its author into question.

Edit - 

From Loose Balls, as told by Mike Storen, then ABA executive:

&nbsp;

>We were all huddled in a hotel suite. Brown and Mikan went down the hall to meet Alcindor and they were in there for three and a half hours. They came out and I said, ""That check got us where we wanted to go, right?""


>Mikan said, ""We decided that it wasn't necessary to give him our best offer. We figure when he comes back to us, then we'll use the check for the second round of talks.""

I understand Hibbert is a presence in the post, defensive stopper. But I am sitting here wondering why in A LOT of media personnel and fans minds he is a clear cut DPOY front runner and ""EASY"" all star.

I will do a quick comparison to a highly scrutinized player in Bosh.

Chris Bosh: 17/7/1/1.0 BPG... 53% FG / 81% FT
Roy Hibbert: 11.5/8/1/ 2.5 BPG ....45% FG / 75% FT

Smaller stats: Hibbert averages more turnovers, a less +/- and is 4 inches taller. Bosh is buried behind Lebron and Wade and without a doubt is a THIRD option who has little to none plays ran for him in a game yet is more efficient and averages more while only playing a minute and a half more per game.

It just bothered me seeing the media attention Hibbert is getting being on Indiana and many other star players are being blanketed by.",0.52,controversial,2/24/14 10:33

Being a Boston fan in general, and a Celtics fan my whole life, I can say I know what it's like to have people make presumptions about you based on the team you root for. I know that you're not all white-button down wearing bros who show up half way through the second quarter and leave if your team is down 7 with under a minute left. But getting LeBron and Bosh suddenly made your team cooler than before. There was suddenly less risk in the investment of fandom, so you had people jumping in on it, wanting to ride a wave they didn't deserve to ride just for the feeling of following a champion. It sucks when something you love becomes so entrenched in the mainstream that every idiot thinks they're an expert. (Trust me, I'm a bartender, and every idiot thinks they're an expert.) I'm sure there are tons of you who know the ins and outs of the game and watch every game with a deep and serious passion, be it from the balcony, or maybe from the loge if you're fortunate, but most likely on TV, cause cool kids snatched up all the tickets. I'm especially sorry that your team is so cool that you can't really share the experience of what it's like to be in a crowd at a Celtics playoff game rooting for the green, with all of the history and love raining down from people of all ages who have always been passionate about their team. I'm sorry you can't look up and see the rafters and feel the moments you have only watched in highlights and know you're a part of something that has roots as deep as they could possibly go. I hope you can look around you and find some other fan, maybe some dude in a Glen Rice jersey, who realizes that what you're a part of now could potentially be the building of some future history, and I hope you take comfort in that, even if most of the other people around you might not be willing to cheer hard because it'll mess up their blow-out.

I remember the day like it was yesterday. October 29th 2010. I was a senior in high school, and I was going to the Big 3 home opener in Miami with my dad. I knew it was going to be special, but I had no idea how special it would truly be. 

In Lebron's time here, I was able to go to countless playoff games. I got to see a game 7 win in the FINALS with my dad, a memory I'll treasure for the rest of my life. I get to tell my future kids at their first heat game that I was there to watch the best player of our generation. I got to see history unfold in front of my eyes during the best 4 years of my life in college. Thank you Lebron. Thank you for what you did for me and the true fans here. You'll always have a special place in our hearts, as I hope Miami will have a place in yours. You didn't owe us anything, and thank you for showing class during the entire process.

For 4 years, you helped me dream a little bit. And for that, I thank you. Long live the King

EDIT: No idea this would get so much attention. In response to everyone, I am thankful for my dad, he makes Lebron look like a peasant. Either way, Lebron helped me share moments with my dad I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. Shoutout to /r/nba for the boys",0.67,controversial,7/12/14 14:35

Another 10 days have gone by, all star starters announced, and this is my updated complete ranking list.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Player (change from last edition)|Comment||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Stephen Curry (same)|Curry isn't MVP but I do believe he's the best overall player in the NBA right now and keeps his number 1 ranking.||
|2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (same)|National media wise has taken a backseat to Harden but he's still right there for MVP race, and I would give it to him if season ended today.||
|3. James Harden (same)|I watched the full 61 point performance live and dude's on another level, but I agree with the national media narrative that his style of play will not sustain long term success in the playoffs.||
|4. Nikola Jokic (+4)|The consistency is starting to remain and Jokic is dominating. He should be the very clear 1st reserve pick for the all star team.||
|5. Joel Embiid (+6)|Him not playing vs. Denver honestly raised his value in my eyes, last night's game showed how important he is.||
|6. Kevin Durant (-1)|With KD (like LeBron) at this point I just expect him to go off in the playoffs. He finished number 1 last year (my final ranking includes playoffs) and he's very much in contention for that spot still.||
|7. Paul George (+2)|The all star starter nod gives him national recognition, and his play has equaled that consistently throughout the season.||
|8. Kawhi Leonard (-2)|The more the season progresses, the more I think he's going to LA. But the Raptors were my preseason pick to win the Finals and that could change things.||
|9. Kyrie Irving (+7)|Good last 10 days. All star starter, and he's by far the most unguardable guard in the East.||
|10. Anthony Davis (-6)|The closer we get to the break, I would not completely rule out a trade. But he's been number 1 this season before but with how stacked the talent at the top is him being here speaks to that.||
|11. Russell Westbrook (+4)|His efficiency has been better the last few games, Thunder winning, should be a clear all star reserve.||
|12. Karl-Anthony Towns (+2)|Last 3 games: 25/18/7, 27/12/5, 33/10/4. Dude is beasting.||
|13. LeBron James (-6)|He's coming back soon, he should finish higher than this when all said and done, but serious questions are starting to emerge. LeBron has made the NBA Finals every year since 2011. That's not happening this year and a Lakers 1st round exit is not out of question, what happens to his reputation (for this season) compared to other superstars if that occurs? It's something to keep in mind.||
|14. Bradley Beal (-2)|I thought he should have been a starter over Kemba, and he has turned himself into the Wizards' franchise centerpiece in a matter of literally weeks.||
|15. Damian Lillard (-2)|Overall I would say quietly having his best season.||
|16. Ben Simmons (+2)|I think he is a near lock for his 1st all star game. At just 22 years old that's nice.||
|17. Rudy Gobert (-7)|He's out of my top 10 but his consistency is enough for me to have him as an all star right now. He would be a very bad omission if left off.||
|18. Blake Griffin (-1)|BG is solid and the rest of the team needs work.||
|19. Jimmy Butler (same)|Despite all the drama, I think Butler is still an all star in the east.||
|20. Kyle Lowry (+2)|Arguably the best point guard in the league the first 3ish weeks but that's long in the past now. Still, overall on the season, he's in my top 20 right now.||
|21. Kemba Walker (-1)|I think he should have been a reserve but still him starting is good for the league.||
|22. LaMarcus Aldridge (+2)|I posted my all star reserves yesterday. One change: I now have Aldridge in over Klay for the 12th spot.||
|23. Donovan Mitchell (+11)|Biggest comeback of 2019 goes to him without question so far.||
|24. Klay Thompson (-3)|He's made 4 straight all star games, a 5th is in jeopardy. It's going to be very close.||
|25. Jrue Holiday (+3)|He keeps finding ways to stay in the elite mix. Although I don't have him in right now, he is a legitimate all star contender.||
|26. Victor Oladipo (+1)|The most unfortunate injury of the season so far.||
|27. DeMar DeRozan (-4)|He was an all star lock even a month ago, but now he's probably not getting in.||
|28. Jusuf Nurkic (+8)|Dude's on the rise. He isn't close to the scoring level as most players above him yet, but his IQ is near Jokic level. He'll have to play consistent to move up higher than this, as now that he's ranked here he has to prove it.||
|29. Steven Adams (-3)|Remains consistent and still a career season, I had him as an all star in late December but I'm going with no.||
|30. Luka Doncic (same)|In the East he would 110% be an all star. I wouldn't be totally surprised to see him get in the West but I think not this year.||
|31. Pascal Siakam (+7)|His consistent play is a big reason the Raptors have remained elite, and with how the East is shaped I believe he is an all star.||
|32. Khris Middleton (+1)|Middleton is currently my 12th pick for the East team. The top upvoted comment on NBA was saying Bledsoe deserves it over him. I disagree. Bledsoe looks like a top 20 overall player at times but he just doesn't keep that level of play consistent over a season. Middleton has played solid and consistent just about the whole season, and with how the East is I give him the all star nod right now.||
|33. CJ McCollum (-2)|If he were in the East, would be a serious all star candidate.||
|34. Draymond Green (-9)|Being more consistent on offense got him a top 25 spot 10 days ago. That consistency hasn't been there since last edition.||
|35. DeMarcus Cousins (NEW)|His fit with Golden State is even better than expected, he takes this team to a new dimension.||
|36. Mike Conley (+6)|As a Grizzlies fan, I would prefer to keep him to Gasol. For the love of humanity even with a tank watching the Shelvin Mack show the last 2 months would be too much.||
|37. Jayson Tatum (-2)|Not quite an all star this year, but my early bet is he will be in 2020.||
|38. Al Horford (+3)|Dude's been playing consistent, clutch and his impact has gone up in 2019.||
|39. Clint Capela (-10)|Injured and value down, which is unfortunate because the way he was playing pre injury he was trending to be a serious all star candidate by now.||
|40. Andre Drummond (-8)|I hate using the term ""empty stats"" and Drummond is very talented, but for 2019 that term is appropriate at times.||
|41. Julius Randle (-4)|Quiet last 10 days, but as I said in my reserve article I would pick him as an all star over Tobias Harris if it came down to those 2.||
|42. Tobias Harris (+4)|Good player, small progression from last season, I don't think he's an all star. He plays better against bad teams than playoff contenders, one of the weirdest players to rank all season.||
|43. John Wall (-3)|Him being 72nd in fan voting wow. His clout took a 180||
|44. Nikola Vucevic (+6)|The Lakers giving up assets for Vucevic is probably a mistake, but I do think he would fit well next to LeBron.||
|45. Buddy Hield (+9)|His consistency and impressive scoring ability gives him a nice bump to the top 45. Very impressive season.||
|46. Domantas Sabonis (-7)|He's been consistent but..from analyzing him a little more that's maybe not always in important clutch situations.||
|47. Serge Ibaka (+2)|Has scored in double figures 12 straight games.||
|48. Eric Bledsoe (+5)|A 40% 3 point shooting Eric Bledsoe would be a top 20 overall player.||
|49. Malcolm Brogdon (+6)|He might get the award for most consistent player on the year. Makes an unexpected jump into the top 50 with 16/5/3 averages and great efficiency. The Bucks join Warriors/Raptors as only teams with 4 top 50 players. As a matter of fact, the Warriors/Raptors/Bucks have 25% of all top 50 players.||
|50. John Collins (-2)|Still playing impressive enough to keep his top 50 spot.||
|51. Myles Turner (-6)|You would like to see him take over with Oladipo now out, we'll see what happens.||
|52. Chris Paul (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|53. Devin Booker (-6)|In 2019 Booker is shooting 31% from 3 point land, the Suns are a mess, I understand he doesn't have much to work with just an unfortunate situation all around.||
|54. Lou Williams (-2)|Congrats on 1st triple double.||
|55. Marc Gasol (+3)|If we are looking at the last few days of Gasol in Memphis it's been a good 10+ years.||
|56. De'Aaron Fox (-12)|Since last edition he's shooting 37% from the field.||
|57. Thaddeus Young (+3)|23/15 against the Raptors shows just how good this guy is. Consistently helps the Pacers win, finished 63rd last season and is even higher than that right now.||
|58. Jamal Murray (-7)|As I've said all year if he can consistently play like he can when on, a top 25 player.||
|59. DeAndre Jordan (-3)|As is the case with Drummond, he feels like an ""empty stats"" guy sometimes.||
|60. Montrezl Harrell (-1)|He's remained consistent off the bench the whole season, a near lock for a top 100 finish and probably top 75 minimum.||
|61. Danilo Gallinari (-4)|Injured and value down.||
|62. D'Angelo Russell (+13)|Since January 2 he's up 40 overall spots. No player in the league is making a serious name for himself at a quicker rate.||
|63. Kyle Kuzma (+1)|Around this part in the ranking, a theme emerges where the talent =/ consistency.||
|64. Zach LaVine (-3)|Despite the Bulls' mess, he is unquestionably having himself a very good season.||
|65. DeAndre Ayton (-3)|With Ayton injured we get to watch the Dragan Bender show.||
|66. Aaron Gordon (+3)|22/11/6 vs. Wizards last game was good.||
|67. JJ Redick (+3)|Consistently getting buckets still.||
|68. Josh Richardson (-3)|Talented, makes impressive plays, but right now this is a more appropriate ranking than the 54th he was at January 2.||
|69. Derrick Rose (-3)|It's been a slow last 10 days.||
|70. Andrew Wiggins (+1)|He's not a bust. Below expectations sure, but not a bust.||
|71. Robert Covington (-8)|Still injured, value down.||
|72. Spencer Dinwiddie (+12)|The injury is unfortunate, but he at least played well enough to where it's highly unlikely he falls out of the top 100 (or even top 90) before he comes back.||
|73. Joe Ingles (-1)|Playing well in his role, just not being asked as much in terms of scoring.||
|74. Paul Millsap (-7)|He's not where he was at pre getting injured for 3 weeks but still top 75.||
|75. Brandon Ingram (-7)|I would seriously consider trading him.||
|76. Hassan Whiteside (+3)|22/16 vs. the Clippers was good. But not enough of those type games.||
|77. Gary Harris (-4)|He's looked good the last few games, just needs to build momentum.||
|78. Willie Cauley-Stein (-4)|""He doesn't contribute to winning basketball"" well he's started every game this season for an above .500 Kings team and has scored in double figures 11 of the last 12 games. He did move down, but a ""so overrated he's underrated"" player.||
|79. Jerami Grant (+1)|What a season for him so far. Very impressed.||
|80. Brook Lopez (+5)|Up 13 spots since January 2. Good to see him have a nice bounce back year.||
|81. Bojan Bogdanovic (same)|He's going to be asked to have a more prominent role with Oladipo out, interested to see what happened.||
|82. Jarrett Allen (+8)|Up 17 spots since January 2. You'd like to see more offensive consistency but this man has some seriously scary potential.||
|83. Darren Collison (+6)|15/7 on 47% shooting last 5 games.||
|84. Marcus Morris (-6)|One of my favorite role players in the entire league, but the claim I witnessed yesterday saying he deserves an all star spot over Tatum/Horford is just absurd.||
|85. Jonas Valanciunas (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|86. Bogdan Bogdanovic (-3)|A little inconsistent (followed up 16/9/8 with being shut down by Memphis) but clearly a top 100 talent this year.||
|87. Kevin Love (-10)|Still injured, value down. But that injury has taken a huge hit to his value at this point.||
|88. Marcus Smart (+5)|Up 17 spots since January 2. Shooting 44% from 3 in 2019 is a stat I would never in a million years believe to be something Marcus Smart could do.||
|89. Al-Farouq Aminu (+10)|This dude put up 17/8/4 with a broken pinky. But also one of the more underrated players overall this season. He finished 112th last season, his chances of a final top 100 spot are decent right now||
|90. Derrick Favors (-5)|Consistently playing well enough to hang on to a top 100 spot.||
|91. Danny Green (+7)|Very impressive game on national TV vs. Houston.||
|92. Harrison Barnes (-10)|Last 5 games: 32% from the field.||
|93. Jaylen Brown (-1)|It's been a 3rd year slump, but he's been able to hang on to a top 100 spot the whole season.||
|94. Otto Porter Jr (+2)|I think he could thrive in a different situation.||
|95. Nikola Mirotic (-8)|His impressive start to the season is keeping him in the top 100 for now, just unfortunate injury situation with him.||
|**96. Justise Winslow (+5)**|101st 10 days ago, Winslow cracks the top 100 for the first time ever. Well deserved and it's been incredible to see his steady progression.||
|97. Dwyane Wade (-3)|Wade keeps his top 100 spot, he's in veteran role but he still makes impressive plays.||
|98. Dennis Schroder (-1)|Schroder makes 5 top 100 players for the Thunder currently.||
|99. Ricky Rubio (-4)|Despite the quiet season, Rubio barely hangs on to his top 100 spot.||
|100. TJ Warren (-9)|Warren edges Lauri Markkanen for the final top 100 spot currently. His shooting performance this season has been impressive (and he's higher than his 106 finish last season) but the league continues to expand in depth and he's now injured for 2-3 weeks.||

450,"James Harden scored 41 points on 15-35 (43%) shooting and was criticized for his poor efficiency, Kyrie Irving scored 40 points on 17-33 (51%) shooting and is called clutch and underrated. Is that 8% the difference between an MVP-like performance and a bad one?",4,a9kl3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a9kl3h/james_harden_scored_41_points_on_1535_43_shooting/,45,1545819723,"Hi, everyone. I'm making this thread cause I'm genuinely curious about what exactly the stigma is against James Harden. He and Kyrie Irving had very similar performances today:

||PTS|REB|AST|TO|STL|BLK|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|James Harden|41|6|7|6|2|1|
|Kyrie Irving|40|10|3|2|1|0|

Both won their respective games, both had 4th quarter game saving-performances, but one performance is regarded as far more superior than the other. Is it because James Harden had no choice, but to chuck the ball without Chris Paul playing? I mean, James Harden had a 41 point game against a Top 5 NBA defense without another player on his team scoring over 20 points. Should that be considered in the conversation? Kyrie Irving had two other teammates score over 20  (Marcus Morris and Jayson Tatum both scored 23) and they barely beat a mid-tier defensive team by 7. *I dunno what to think anymore*. I seem to be in the minority now when it comes to unbiasedly dissecting Harden's games. 

Don't get me wrong, both of these performances were stellar, I just think Harden's was a little more impressive especially since it was against a defensively experienced Thunder team that had won 4 of their last 5 with incredible performances from Paul George.

What do you guys think?",0.52,controversial,12/26/18 2:22
451,Why is there this narrative that MJ didn't have nearly as much help as guys today when he played with one of the best 2 way forwards of all time and the greatest rebounder in modern NBA history?,4,7v6xno,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7v6xno/why_is_there_this_narrative_that_mj_didnt_have/,88,1517782557,Not to mention rodman was no slouch on defense either. Dudes team was stacked. I'm not taking away from Jordan as a player or his accomplishments I'm simply asking why people use this as an argument against guys like LBJ or even KD when discussed. I guess it could have something to do with those guy already being established superstars and joining stacked teams coupled with the media of today's NBA but still when just looking at talent and talent alone I'd say Jordans team is more stacked than any lebron team but obviously not KDs Warriors,0.52,controversial,2/4/18 14:15

With the Pistons down two and with the ball with a chance to tie or win, he let them freelance and didn't call a time out to write up a play. The freelance failed and then the warriors made two more free throws to put the Pistons down 4. After this, Stan decides to call a time out with 5 seconds left down 4 instead of calling it when they were down 2. I can only think he was writing up a miraculous 4 point play in that timeout because of the incredible genius that he is. Thanks for that display of amazing coaching Stan.",0.48,controversial,12/9/17 2:34

I wanna start this post by saying I don't think Giannis was THAT bad in that series, but his underperformance cannot go understated. He started off the series hot, scoring 24 and 30 in the first 2 games on good shooting, but fell off a cliff after that.


In the last 4 games of the series (0-4), Giannis shot 47% from the freethrow line (17/36), and had 12 (he also fouled out this game, in a close loss that would have put them up 3-0), 25, 24, 21 scoring games on inefficient scoring from the field. His defense and rebounding were still on par, but his flaws as a player allowed the Raptors to take advantage of that and win the series, yet nobody bats an eye and are quick to brush it off as ""inexperience"" or ""THE KLAW"". No, Giannis straight up underperformed.",0.54,controversial,7/17/20 6:12

458,"[OC] Other ""Coach of the Year"" ballots may have more legitimacy or accuracy, but this is the only one that ranks the candidates from # 1 all the way to # 30",141,hxn56q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxn56q/oc_other_coach_of_the_year_ballots_may_have_more/,84,1595714279,"The NBA league office announced that all awards will be officially based on play PRIOR to the bubble. With that, the cases are locked, the campaigns are closed, and the voting will begin.

Rather than give a traditional ""Coach of the Year"" ballot that ranks from 1-3, I thought it may be an interesting (and indulgent) exercise to go all the way from 1-30.

Some caveats:

--- We're ranking coaches based on their performance THIS SEASON only. Obviously, Billy Donovan isn't as good of a coach as Gregg Popovich. However, if you were only ranking their ""Coach of the Year"" candidacy for this particular season, Donovan has a better campaign argument.

--- Since I don't watch every game for every team, I'm going to have to resort to a bigger picture analysis. If you're a diehard fan of your team who watches every game, you'd have a lot better insight into a coach's game management and situational adjustments. Let us know how you feel about that -- is your coach underrated? Overrated?

--- Personally, I'm going to rank coaches that *started* the year (as opposed to interim replacements.) That’s important to mention off the bat, because it applies right away —

######**the complete [COACH OF THE YEAR](https://next-episode.net/coach/season-8) Ballot**

**(30) David Fizdale, N.Y. Knicks: 4-18 record**

David Fizdale became a head coach with so much fanfare and media approval that his fall from grace has been more dramatic than Icarus. This year, he got fired 22 games into his second season on the job. Amazingly, this isn't the first time that's happened to him. Back in Memphis, he also got fired 19 games into his second season on the job.

We don't know exactly what goes on behind the scenes, but it can't be good. Do you know how bad things must be going to get fired 20 games into a season? That's like being halfway through sex with someone and saying: *ya know, I think I need to leave...* Something seriously FUNKY must have going on in there. Raging herpes. Oozing puss. Rotten vagina.

I don't want to call David Fizdale the rotten vagina of coaches, but his tenure with the Knicks did smell pretty funky. The team (right or wrong) signed a bunch of veterans with the intention to strive for the 8th seed, but they flopped. Ultimately, the real goal was giving their young prospects an environment to grow, but that didn't happen either. Dennis Smith and Kevin Knox are somehow getting worse and worse. 

The Knicks did a full house cleaning, but it may be some time before the smell is out of the building.

---

**(29) John Beilein, Cleveland: 14-40 record**

If you think it's difficult to get fired 20 games into a season, imagine getting fired halfway through your first year on the job right after you've signed a lucrative FIVE-YEAR contract. 

With John Beilein, we know more clearly what went wrong. In hindsight, it was a mistake to think that the 67-year-old Beilein could make the transition to the NBA after a lifetime in college. He simply didn't mesh with the ""thugs/slugs"" in the NBA, causing the Cavs to pull the plug before a full-out mutiny.

Given this disaster, how can we rank Beilein higher than Fizdale? We're splitting hairs, but there are a few more positives. Beilein's Cavs had a better record than Fizdale's Knicks despite lower expectations (based on over/under.) Beilein also ""resigned,"" meaning the decision to part was at least somewhat mutual. He realized the error of his ways, and handed things over to an experienced assistant in J.B. Bickerstaff. As embarrassing and costly as the Beilein era may have been, it's hard to see much long-term damage for the franchise.

---

**(28) Scottie Brooks, Washington: 24-40 record**

With John Wall injured, the Washington Wizards would have a hard time competing for the playoffs. Still, Scottie Brooks didn't help matters. The team ranked dead last in defensive rating by a good margin, indicating some serious issues with the system and the effort level. Even Bradley Beal looked disengaged on that end, ranking as one of the worst defenders in the league.

More than anything, Brooks' crime is a slow adjustment to that problem. Despite their defensive issues, he continued to start league [LVP](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) Isaiah Thomas for 37 games. Brooks seems like a likable guy, but his slow trigger has defined and tarnished his coaching career so far.

---

**(27) Jim Boylen, Chicago: 22-43 record**

Even his defenders would say Jim Boylen is about as cuddly as a cactus and charming as an eel. His players' support for him ranges behind tepid indifference and downright annoyance. Still, sometimes it takes a Grinch to get young players locked in on defense. To his credit, Boylen did improve the Bulls on that end. Their defensive rating leapt up from 25th to 14th this season.

But at the end of the day, the overall results simply aren't here. Despite offensive-minded youngsters like Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen (marginalized this year), the Bulls ranked 27th in offensive rating. Largely as a result, they were on pace to win 27.7 games, well short of their 33.5 over/under. Being ""likable"" and being ""successful"" don't go hand in hand, but NBA coaches need to check 1 of those 2 boxes to survive. So far, Boylen has gone 0 for 2.

---

**(26) Lloyd Pierce, Atlanta: 20-47 record**

The Atlanta Hawks hired Lloyd Pierce on the basis of his defensive reputation, but we've seen little evidence of that on the court so far. In his first year on the job, the Hawks ranked 27th in defensive rating. After a full year of training and development in his system, they climbed all the way up to... 28th. Through it all, franchise player Trae Young looks completely lost, grading as a worse defender than our LVP Isaiah Thomas. 

There's not much evidence that Pierce is a BAD coach, but there's not much evidence that he's going to be able to cure what ails them either. He'll probably get another season or two on the job from the patient franchise, but he needs to make some improvements eventually. Young is an albatross on defense, sure, but one little guard shouldn't be enough to sink you like this. (For evidence, consider Boston ranked 4th in defense during lil' Isaiah Thomas' near-MVP season.)

---

**(25) Kenny Atkinson, Brooklyn: 28-34 record**

Our third coach who got fired midseason actually ranks higher than others. On the court, it's hard to find much fault in Kenny Atkinson's performance. Despite having two max players on the shelf, he still had his Nets in the playoff race. They weren't any great shakes, but they were competitive.

However, we have to acknowledge that the job of an NBA coach goes beyond offensive and defensive ratings. It's also about managing a locker room, and managing egos. The Nets had built a good culture before this, but that culture presumably got rocked by the arrival of their new stars. It's up to Atkinson to bridge that gap, and instead it swallowed him whole.

---

**(24) Ryan Saunders, Minnesota: 19-45 record**

The Minnesota Timberwolves will fall well short of their preseason expectations (35.5 over/under), and will continue to waste Karl-Anthony Towns' historically good offensive talent. It's still unclear if young pup Ryan Saunders should have been handed this job at such a young age; he hasn't proven that he deserves it yet.

If there's any consolation, it's that Saunders appears in lock step with executive Gersson Rosas in terms of preferred playing style. Rosas came over from Houston with a desire to create more of a Morey-Ball approach. Saunders is doing his part, cranking up the gas to keep the team 3rd in pace, 3rd in three-point attempts, 3rd in free-throw attempts. The results don't match up yet, but at least they're on the same page. For now. Time will tell whether a new ownership group will come in and rip up that playbook.

---

**(23) Gregg Popovich, San Antonio: 27-36 record**

I imagine this low ranking will be among the least popular picks on the board. After all, Gregg Popovich is a legend. Even at this age, he's *still* a top 10 coach overall.

That said, legends aren't bullet proof or immune from criticism. Popovich needs to take some blame for an underwhelming year in San Antonio. The unconventional mid-range offense actually works better than you'd expect (11th in rating), but the problems come on the other end. The Spurs have struggled mightily on D this year, ranking all the way down at 25th. The rotations have been an issue there, with too much Bryn Forbes and Marco Bellinelli and probably too little Jakob Poeltl.

It still may feel weird to rank Pop in the bottom half for his performance this year, but I'd ask you: if this team was coached by a random dude named ""Joe Schmo,"" where would you put him?

---

**(22) Brett Brown, Philadelphia: 39-26 record**

This hasn't been a banner year for Gregg Popovich, and it hasn't been a banner year for his protege Brett Brown either. The Sixers made some head-scratching decisions this offseason. They grabbed the biggest pieces they could find, and jammed them together without much regard for ""fit."" Still, there's a lot of talent here. There's enough talent to justify their 54.5 preseason over/under, and there's enough talent to compete with everyone in the East (outside of Milwaukee, perhaps.)

Instead, the Sixers stumbled along on a 49-win pace, on track for the 6th seed. If this was a normal year without the COVID-bubble, then that would be a much bigger problem. The team is starting to make some adjustments and add more shooters like Shake Milton into the lineup, but it may be too little, too late.

---

**(21) Dwane Casey, Detroit: 20-46 record**

It's hard to judge veteran Dwane Casey either way based on the returns this season so far. The Pistons will fall well short of preseason expectations (37.5 over/under), but there are obvious reasons why. Star Blake Griffin got injured again, and pseudo-star Andre Drummond got traded away. 

To Dwane Casey's credit, he's tried to make a meal with the leftovers in the cupboard. Derrick Rose continues to be a fan favorite (if not an analytical darling), and PF Christian Wood appears to be a breakout success. Overall, there's no real identity or grand plan in place here, but perhaps that will change if the lottery balls go their way.

---

**(20) Terry Stotts, Portland: 29-37 record**

Terry Stotts and Dwane Casey may have a few beers after the season and commiserate together about their challenges this year. Like Casey, Stotts has been overwhelmed by injuries -- to Jusuf Nurkic -- to Zach Collins -- to Rodney Hood -- to Trevor Ariza -- etc. All this from a team that didn't have much depth to start.

Stotts and the Blazers drew a stroke of good luck with this bubble format. They'll be in the 9th spot right now, and well within range to sneak into the playoffs. If it wasn't for that, Stotts may be drawing more fire. The team's defense has slipped to 27th overall, which is hard to excuse no matter what roster problems you have. Stotts is a good and respected coach in general, but there's a chance his message may have run stale here. If they bomb out in the bubble, I wouldn't be surprised if they look for a fresh voice like assistant Nate Tibbetts for next year.

---

**(19) Luke Walton, Sacramento: 28-36 record**

Luke Walton and the Kings got off to a disastrous start given their expectations. It's never a good sign when your fanbase grumbles, *he's no Dave Joerger.* 

But after weathering the storm, there are some signs of hope on the horizon. A bold decision to bring Buddy Hield off the bench has worked out, with the team rattling off a 13-7 stretch before the shutdown. They had a slim chance to rally and make the playoffs if we played a full schedule, and they'll have some chance to do the same in the bubble. Overall, a disappointing start for Walton, but not a complete disaster.

---

**(18) James Borrego, Charlotte: 23-42 record**

It's very difficult to judge James Borrego, because it's difficult to judge exactly what was going on in the twisted minds of the Charlotte front office. On paper, Borrego did an admirable job to take a bad roster and lead them to a decent mark of 23 wins. In fact, their over/under coming into this year was only 23.5 over a full 82 games (lowest in the NBA). P.J. Washington's had a nice rookie year, and PG Devonte' Graham has been better than expected (although he's cooled off.)

At the same time, is *this* what the Hornets wanted? A ""not THAT bad"" team? As a result, they'll end up in the 8th slot prior to the NBA Draft lottery, in that dreaded middle ground. In a sense, Borrego did *too* good of a job squeezing out a few extra wins. I'm inclined to give him props for that because the franchise must have given him a mandate to compete (why else sign Terry Rozier to a big contract?). As a franchise, the team gets poor grades, but as a coach, it's hard to fault him here.

---

**(17) Alvin Gentry, New Orleans: 28-36 record**

James Borrego hasn't had much talent to work with in Charlotte. Down in Nawlins, Alvin Gentry may have *too much*. Earlier in the season, he appeared overwhelmed by all the pieces on the roster and struggled to develop a consistent rotation for the team. If it wasn't for Brandon Ingram's breakout, the Pelicans could have been in too deep of a whole to dig their way out.

Of course, some stocky rookie waddled in, and looked pretty darn good. Zion Williamson gives this team an entirely new ceiling, and has been worked into the lineup in a smart, prudent fashion. For that, Gentry deserves credit. He also deserves credit for having a consistent philosophy. His team is going to run, run, run like Forrest Gump. They've finished in the top 3 in pace each season for the past three years. It hasn't worked like a charm overall, as Gentry will be on track to finish with a losing record for the 4th time in his 5 years, but perhaps they'll finally hit their stride in the bubble.

---

**(16) Steve Clifford, Orlando: 30-35 record**

By this point, what you see is what you get with coach Steve Clifford. We've come to expect a top 10 defense (# 9 this year), but a record around the .500 mark. In his defense, the offensive talent is limited, and Jon Isaac (arguably their best overall player) missed significant time. Still, for Clifford to jump in these yearly rankings, we need to see more of an offensive system in place.

---

**(15) Steve Kerr, Golden State: 15-50 record**

WTF? Why is the coach with the worst record in the league doing all the way up here?

Allow me to explain. Being a head coach is like being a jockey. You need to know when to trot, when to stay with the pack, and when to crack the whip and turn up the gas down the stretch. And, sadly, you need to know when your horse is lame and needs to be shot and put out of its misery.

Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors realized they had a wobbly, broken-down horse early on, and put the breaks on sooner than later. As a result, they'll be locked into the # 1 spot among their NBA lottery odds. In theory that doesn't matter much because the top three teams (GS, CLE, MIN) all have the same odds at # 1 overall. However, if they slide down, Golden State will remain ahead of the others; the *worst* pick they can get is # 5. That type of patience is rare and admirable for a veteran coach like Kerr; after years of being in ""win now"" mode, he's showing a long-term vision as well.

---

**(14) Nate McMillan, Indiana: 39-26 record**

The Indiana Pacers continued to chug along with another playoff appearance despite Victor Oladipo missing more time. Coach Nate McMillan (and assistant Dan Burke) deserve a lot of credit for their strength defensively; they finished in the top 10 in defense for the second season in a row. Their scheme works well, and covers for some limited players along the way.

If there's any criticism of McMillan, it'd be on the offensive end. The Pacers found a little something with Domatas Sabonis as a playmaker (5.0 assists per game), but it's still not enough to make the team formidable offensively. Their ""MoreyBall"" rating is the worst in the league -- they finished last in both free-throw attempts and three-point attempts. Some teams can overcome that playing style, but the Pacers haven't been one of them; their offensive rating is # 18 for the second straight year. Given that need, I'd be curious to see if the team could develop Doug McDermott into a Bojan Bogdanovic - type player for them -- he hit 44.5% of his threes, but got only 20.0 minutes a game.

---

**(13) Monty Williams, Phoenix: 26-39 record**

This ranking may seem too high for the coach of a 26-39 team, but we need to consider some context here. The Phoenix Suns had finished with an average record of 20-62 over the last two seasons, so this 33-win pace is a marked step up for them. They've also gotten into the top 20 in offensive and defensive rating. That may sound like mediocrity to you, but again it's a big jump up from the previous year (28th offensive, 29th defense.)

Better still, we're seeing some strong player development from this club. Deandre Ayton still looked strong post PED suspension, and Mikal Bridges played well in the second half of the year. After all the mess and goat stink in Phoenix, there are actual good vibes here, and Monty Williams deserves credit for that.

---

**(12) Quin Snyder, Utah: 41-23 record**

Quin Snyder is an awesome coach, only penalized here by his own lofty expectations. Coming into the season, a few pundits though the Jazz may have what it took to be the top seed in the West, but they're going to fall short of that and even fall short of their preseason over/under (of 53.5 wins). Of course, it didn't help that Mike Conley forgot how to shoot for the few month or two of the season. Still, Snyder's bunch continues to be well coached on both ends, with ball movement on offense and discipline on defense. They'd have been an interesting playoff darkhorse if not for the bad corona-vibes and the unfortunate Bojan Bogdanovic injury.

---

**(11) Mike Malone, Denver: 43-22 record**

Denver's Mike Malone is in the same boat as Quin Snyder; he did a good job, but he's *expected* to do a good job. I'm going to rank him slightly higher because the Nuggets were slightly ahead, and were also set to slightly exceed their preseason win total (on track to win 54, 1 game better than their 53.0 estimate.)

Going forward, it'll be interesting to see if Malone can take his offense up a notch. They play at a very slow pace (29th) and don't shoot many threes (26th). To actually win the title, their shooters will need to step it up. If Gary Harris won't break out of his prolonged slump, then it's imperative that Michael Porter Jr. fulfills his potential and provides that third scoring punch.

---

**(10) Doc Rivers, L.A. Clippers: 44-20 record**

Stars and shooting aren't a problem for the Los Angeles Clippers. It's fair to say they're the most talented roster in the entire NBA. Given that, is their 44-20 record a disappointment? Eh. Maybe. But I'd counter that it doesn't really matter. Doc Rivers' primary mission this regular season was to make it to the playoffs healthy, and the team appears on track to do just that.

If there's any criticism here (of a team with a top 5 offense and defense) it's that their best players may not have gotten enough reps together. Do the new kids on the block Kawhi Leonard and Paul George fit with the old guard in Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell? What's the best starting lineup? Best *closing* lineup? There are still some unanswered questions here that need to be addressed in a hurry if they're going to fulfill their title aspirations in the bubble.

---

**(9) Taylor Jenkins, Memphis: 32-33 record**

Personally, I expected the Memphis Grizzlies to have the worst in the Western Conference, so it's downright shocking that they're in the 8th spot at the moment. The NBA may be trying to steal that playoff berth away from them, but that won't change the great job that rookie coach Taylor Jenkins has done this year.

Are the Grizzlies actually this good? Probably not. Their advanced stats are worse than their record, and Jaren Jackson Jr. hasn't taken the expected leap on defense yet. Still, wins are wins, and a coach shouldn't be penalized for collecting more than he should.

---

**(8) Mike D'Antoni, Houston: 40-24 record**

Based on the simple matter of wins versus preseason expectations (and an over/under of 54.0), the Houston Rockets have been slightly underwhelming this year. Still, veteran Mike D'Antoni deserves a lot of credit for remaking the team on the fly. Changing from Chris Paul to Russell Westbrook may not be a huge difference in quality, but it's a huge difference in playing style. As a result, the Rockets leapt up from the 26th fastest pace last year all the way up to 4th this season. They'll looking like a proper D'Antoni and Morey team right now.

In fact, they've taken that bold experiment up another notch this year by ditching Clint Capela and emulating [Rick Moranis](https://images.app.goo.gl/ooNpDDaJPEGFzzDM7). So far, so good. These Smallball Rockets still have some  lingering question marks about their defense and their rebounding, but they're extremely dangerous right now nonetheless. It's hard to imagine too many older coaches understanding and embracing this like D'Antoni has.

---

**(7) Brad Stevens, Boston: 43-21 record**

Brad Stevens has always been a media darling, and he's justifying that reputation this year. The Celtics lost Kyrie Irving and Al Horford, but are still top 5 in offense and top 5 in defense. Life without Kyrie has gone swimmingly, opening up some air for young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to breathe; they're both in the running for Most Improved Player. 

As with Mike D'Antoni, Stevens also deserves credit for working with a limited hand at center. But rather than force the issue and overplay some stiffs, he's understood that the team just may be better off with 6'8"" Daniel Theis manning the fort instead.

---

**(6) Frank Vogel, L.A. Lakers: 49-14 record**

It's never a good sign when you sign a new contract with a team, and are immediately placed among the favorites for ""First Coach Fired"" in Vegas. Frank Vogel walked that tightrope this season, with plenty of spectators expecting him to fail and fall to his demise.

Instead, Vogel has kept his head down, and kept his focus, and helped this Lakers team grab the # 1 seed out West. Obviously it's an easier task when you have LeBron James and Anthony Davis, but this isn't a loaded roster otherwise. Moreover, there are a lot of moving parts and new pieces to work in. The fact that Vogel has this largely-old team ranked # 3 in defensive rating is a true testament to his success this year.

---

**(5) Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee: 53-12 record**

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is on track to win his second consecutive MVP award. While we tend to think the media likes new ""narratives,"" but we've seen repeat winners before. Since 2000, Tim Duncan repeated as MVP, Steve Nash repeated as MVP, LeBron James repeated as MVP (on two separate occasions), and Steph Curry repeated as MVP as well.

*Coaches* don't get the same luxury. In fact, since the award was created in 1962, the Coach of the Year winner has NEVER repeated the following season. You win once, you get to the back of the line. That tendency has really hurt Mike Budenholzer's candidacy this year. On paper, he should absolutely be in the running. The Bucks are once again # 1 in defense, # 1 in overall rating, # 1 in W-L record. They're on a better pace than last year's team, despite losing Malcolm Brogdon over the summer. If Giannis can repeat for the same feat twice, why shouldn't Budenholzer be allowed to do the same?

---

**(4) Rick Carlisle, Dallas: 40-27 record**

Everyone expected the Milwaukee Bucks to be dominant, but no one expected the Dallas Mavericks to be this good, this early. They've jumped the line and arrived in the playoffs earlier than schedule. They're only 1 win away from beating their preseason over/under of 40.5 despite all the missed games.

Like Mike Budenholzer, Rick Carlisle has benefited in that endeavor from a transcendent player in Luka Doncic. At the same time, this Mavs' machine has been rolling with and without Doncic. They rank # 1 in offensive efficiency this year, and depending on whether you want to factor in pace and league trends or not, they may have one of the best offenses we've ever seen from a statistical standpoint. It's quite an achievement from a coach who cut his stripes as a defensive specialist, and indicates the type of attitude that coaches need to adapt and evolve over time.

---

**(3) Erik Spoelstra, Miami: 41-24 record**

The Miami Heat pulled a free agency coup by signing Jimmy Butler away from Philadelphia. Still, it's not like people expected that to vault them to the top of the East. Butler was a good player, but a difficult one to manage. He blended into the crowd as well as a skinhead at a Bar Mitzvah. Overall, adding Butler only boosted the team's preseason over/under win total to a modest 43.5.

Turns out, Butler fit in better with the Heat than anyone expected, on and off the court. Butler hasn't shot well from the field, but his attacking and playmaking helped open up the offense (6th in the league) and propelled the team to a 51.7-win pace. He's fit in like a glove in terms of their tough-dude culture as well.

Erik Spoelstra should get huge props for developing that culture and that system. But more than anything, he deserves credit for their player development system. Sure, Jimmy Butler is a star, and Bam Adebayo had star talent. At the same time, no one had ever heard of players like Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson at this time last year. These are complete randos who will make a combined $3M this season -- just half of Cristiano Felicio's salary. Having a coach who can grow talent like that in his backyard is a huge advantage for any franchise.

---

**(2) Billy Donovan, Oklahoma City: 41-24 record**

After Oklahoma City blew it up this summer by trading Russell Westbrook and Paul George, coach Billy Donovan felt like a dead man walking. Instead, Donovan and those fireproof zombie hordes in OKC sieged to a 41-24 record. How good is that? Hell, it's an even better winning percentage than the team had *last* year with Westbrook and George (in a career year.) 

Given all this surprising success, Donovan would be a fair winner of this award. He's managed to take in a bunch of new bodies and form a cohesive team. He's even had success playing three point guards together (CP3, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Dennis Schroder.) 

If you want to nitpick his candidacy, you could point out that the hodgepodge roster has a lot of talent scattered throughout. Chris Paul had become underrated, and Danilo Gallinari has always been underrated as well. The team's low preseason over/under total (32.5) was largely based on the uncertainty about further trades. Everyone knew that this team had the talent to be competitive if they stayed together. Still, no one expected them to be *this* good.

---

**(1) Nick Nurse, Toronto: 46-18 record**

Last season, Nick Nurse finally got his first chance as an NBA head coach. He ended up having as good of a rookie year as anyone since [Henry Rowengartner](https://images.app.goo.gl/qJFjmHV7PFkKAmsC9). Nurse coached circles around some of the best in the business en route to a championship season. 

Amazingly, he may have been even more impressive *this* year. Without Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, the Toronto Raptors held steady and didn't miss much of a beat. In fact, they're on pace to win 58.9 games, over a dozen more than their preseason over/under of 46.5. 

Technically, Nurse still has limited experience as an NBA head coach, but he's already proven to be one of the masters. If we were to judge based on the results of this (semi-)season only, he'd be my personal ""Coach of the Year.""",0.79,hot,7/25/20 14:57

Granted, all of these players basically play starter minutes, but their minutes are de facto restricted on their team because the starter at their position is more well-rounded and hence deserves more minutes (except for Lou’s case) except in certain circumstances. Giannis has no such restriction. Him playing more than he does is literally unsportsmanlike with the way he dominates. 

He’s even played less minutes than “Mr. Load Management” Kawhi Leonard, despite Kawhi having a far better supporting cast to ease his minutes. 

He is 63rd in the league in minutes, putting up top 5 rebounding and points per game, and is top-2 on his team in **every statistical category** except 3-pt shooting. Not to mention top-2 DPOY candidate. 

It’s just wild that his play style is basically auto-load-managing. He could play more if he wanted to. He doesn’t have to. They still have the best record in the league and he’s the runaway MVP. 

I just don’t see anyone can make a case against this man for not just MVP but a historic season. He just can’t stop getting better. 

Tangentially speaking of trajectories, Pascal Siakam is basically gonna be this man with slightly less dominance but a way better jump shot in just 1-2 more years. It’s a good time to be an NBA fan.

460,[OC] Players who were surprisingly bad in the clutch (2019-20),39,hxnlyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxnlyd/oc_players_who_were_surprisingly_bad_in_the/,26,1595716171,"I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/huw14f/oc_5_clutch_players_that_might_have_gone_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about 5 unnoticed players who were good in the clutch, and was suggested to make one about players who were surprisingly bad. I'm not considering players who have taken too few shots and/or don't have a large enough sample size to judge from. Moreover, I wanted to look at players who are going to play a major role in the bubble.

# Luka Doncic

*97 min, 65 FGA, 32/17/65, 41.9% TS*

Mavericks have the best offense this season but their **clutch offense ranks 29th**(!) in the league. The Mavs are 14-21 in close games, which is 22nd (W-L) in the league and they're the only playoff team in the bottom 10. Luka has a 36.2 USG% in clutch and almost every possession starts from him but unlike last year he hasn't been good enough in crunchtime. He also has the **lowest TS%** out of 29 players with more than 50 FGA.

Clutch FGs by distance from rim:

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|4-12 (33%)|6-35 (17%)|

* Luka's shot 6-35 from distance and most of his attempts from beyond the arc are closely contested step back threes at the end of the shot clock. Shots like these - over [Okogie](https://imgur.com/lk7Y1WW) or [Schroder](https://imgur.com/ydBcCWz) aren't considered good shots for most players but Luka has hit stepbacks at a decent clip (34.7%) this season. This might be the result of poor shot selection ([?](https://imgur.com/Ug20RU3))
* Luka is also 1-13 on [shots to tie or take the lead](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_id=2020&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=N&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=2&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&is_tying=Y&is_go_ahead=Y&c1stat=fga&c1comp=ge&c1val=10&order_by=fga#stats::7) in the final 2 mins
* He is 8th in total clutch assists (21) and 6th in assists *per 100 possessions.* His assists usually come off blow-bys and [kicking-out](https://imgur.com/2cxbo5d) for a 3 or to a [cutter](https://imgur.com/XIMmnyY). He's also prone to turning the ball over but that's to be expected with being the primary option and being blitzed constantly

Ultimately, Luka (and the Mavs) need to be better on offense in close games (which are inevitable in the playoffs) because they're not beating anybody with their defense.

# LeBron James

*97 min, 60 FGA, 33/17/62, 43.3% TS*

LeBron numbers show that he hasn't really been klutch this season. He has the second lowest TS% out of players who've attempted atleast 50 FGs.

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|2-11 (18%)|5-29 (17%)|

* Out of his 60 field goal attempts, nearly half of them (5-29) are three pointers and almost all of his 3s are the signature 'stare at the ball' stepback three. Contrary to the memes, he's far from automatic on these shots in the clutch. Even when's able to get the switch he desires he frequently settles for [26+ ft shots](https://imgur.com/NnucbCo).
* LeBron also posts up a good number of times when he gets a smaller defender on him. He easily bullies his way down and turns around for a [fadeaway jumper](https://imgur.com/XcidVgd) which hasn't been accurate (unless it's [boston](https://imgur.com/dXDBh0U) ofc) or [spins](https://imgur.com/Z2GY3SE) and finishes at the rim. After watching all of his clutch shots and looking at the numbers, it's evident that he hasn't really been efficient anywhere outside the restricted area.
* Looking on the bright side, LeBron's second in total assists(26) and **first in assists** ***per 100 possessions***. His vision and passing is nearly lethal - most of his assists are from [rolling](https://imgur.com/NlMnQTH)/[cutting](https://imgur.com/UTMV0FA) big men; and when double teamed on the [post](https://imgur.com/Joq0atx) or the [perimeter](https://imgur.com/xKJinmb), he delivers pinpoint passes to open teammates.

In the end, I'm not too concerned because... uh because it's LeBron. The Lakers have the 4th best clutch record (18-9) despite LeBron's shooting struggles and it would be foolish to not expect LeBron to be a notch better in the playoffs.

# Jimmy Butler

*100 min, 60 FGA, 28/15/74, 45.6% TS*

Butler had great clutch stats last season but it's been a totally different story this season. He has the **lowest FG%** out of  29 players who've attempted 50 field goals and by a wide margin of 4% from second lowest (Luka). He's usually the primary ball handler on the Heat and has to create his own shots.

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|0 to 4FT|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|7-14 (50%)|7-26 (27%)|3-20 (15%)|

* He has taken a good number of pull-up jumpers from both [beyond the arc](https://imgur.com/JVpiIdG) and in the [mid-range](https://imgur.com/649tyHQ) with underwhelming efficiency. Outside the paint, he struggles to make a field goal and he's only able to finish at the rim [against bad defenses](https://imgur.com/5KWoJZV); clutch rim finishing (50%) is significantly worse than season percentage (63.7%)).
* Butler is 2-19 on [shots to tie or take the lead](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_id=2020&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=N&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=2&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&is_tying=Y&is_go_ahead=Y&c1stat=fga&c1comp=ge&c1val=10&order_by=fga#stats::7) in the final 2 mins
* Clutch FT numbers can sometimes be misleading because of intentional fouls. That's partly true for Butler too but even after considering those, he draws a ton of [fouls](https://imgur.com/u3ejqH1) (much like the whole season). He's first in total FTA and FTA per 100 in the clutch. His TS% isn't decent  despite being buoyed by FTs.
* Aside from his shooting woes, Butler has been quite impressive as a playmaker. He rarely turns the ball over and makes the right passes when defenses collapse on the paint. [Robinson](https://imgur.com/IPO0VKt) (*8-21 from 3*) and [Herro](https://imgur.com/qX6PrQC) (*8-15 from 3*) have been reliable at the receiving end of these passes.

# Brandon Ingram

*106 min, 63 FGA, 36/28.6/70, 47.3% TS*

Pelicans are in the bottom 5 in both clutch offense and defense and are 12-24 in close games. To be fair they didn't have their full line-up for majority of the season. Before Zion joined, Ingram was the first option on the team and was taking almost every shot in crunchtime. 

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|9-29 (31%)|6-21 (28.6%)|

* Ingram's midranges are usually [turnaround fadeaways](https://imgur.com/r2mLnQ1) where he uses his length to shoot over defenders. His efficiency on those is below average. Sometimes, he pulls up in the mid-range while [coming off a screen](https://imgur.com/COh54g2) too. He's [finished](https://imgur.com/ZEwcOoK) at rim with his season efficiency.
* Pretty much all of his three pointers are [off the catch](https://imgur.com/wUkInQG) or [1 dribble pull-ups](https://imgur.com/4b7EJcT) off a screen,and he's shooting below 30% on them
* He doesn't pass too often, but has shown that he can find the [cutting man](https://imgur.com/IOmlCLR) or an [open shooter](https://imgur.com/Iu9WXcl) from the post. He was constantly blitzed against Utah and was able to [find Favors](https://imgur.com/43SCZbV) on multiple possessions without turning the ball over.",0.83,hot,7/25/20 15:29
461,"In 2004-2005, the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets each won road games against each other on last second buzzer-beating shots. That summer, the New York Liberty and the Houston Comets did the same exact thing. (OC)",21,hxqwzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxqwzs/in_20042005_the_new_york_knicks_and_the_houston/,3,1595728224,"16 years ago, the cosmic forces aligned two cities together in an escapable fate; to lose last second shots at home. Not only did the Knicks and Rockets exchange road buzzer beaters in the 2004-2005 season, but that fateful summer, the New York Liberty and now-defunct Houston Comets of the WNBA did the same. 

**Game 1 - New York Knicks @ Houston Rockets - November 14, 2004**

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200411180HOU.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200411180HOU.html)

The gauntlet was dropped in a nationally televised game when Jamal Crawford drained a buzzer beating game winning 3, down 2, for a 93-92 win. 

Video evidence:

**Game 2 - Houston Rockets @ New York Knicks - January 21, 2005** 

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/200501210NYK.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/200501210NYK.html)

How will the Rockets respond to the Crawford Miracle? As the Knicks lead 91-90, Houston Rockets legend and savior Scott Padgett enters the game for Josh Howard with 10.2 seconds remaining only to drain a buzzer-beater jump shot to give the Rockets a 92-91 vindicating win. 

Video evidence:

**Game 3 - New York Liberty @ Houston Comets - July 12, 2005**

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507120HOU.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507120HOU.html)

Was the balance complete with Padgett's Revenge? The battle unexpectedly raged into the summer months during a meeting of the New York Liberty and the Houston Comets. Tied at the end of regulation, Crystal Robinson knocks down one of her three 3-point field goals with 1.2 seconds to give the Liberty the 68-65 win over the Comets. Visual evidence has been lost to history, but this article recaps the events of the fateful night.

[https://www.espn.com/wnba/recap?gameId=250712004](https://www.espn.com/wnba/recap?gameId=250712004)

**Game 4 - Houston Comets @ New York Liberty - July 27, 2005 - The Final Battle (?)**

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507270NYL.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507270NYL.html)

The dormant battle was awakened again, but how would the Comets respond in the final meeting? Perfectly balance as all should be, the game was tied at 69-69 until the final hero Michelle Snow knocked down the game winning floater to give the Houston Comets the 71-69 win, completing the saga that linked Houston and New York into an inescapable basketball time loop in 2004 through 2005.

We have an opportunity to hear so much more of what happens on the court. I think that's going to be amazing. 

I want to hear guys calling for screens, guys yelling 'and one!' and Carmelo cursing at teammates while he's grabbing rebounds.

466,Moses Malone is the only player in NBA history to average above 10 offensive rebounds in the playoffs,7,hxurz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxurz3/moses_malone_is_the_only_player_in_nba_history_to/,5,1595741963,"In the 1978-79 playoffs he averaged an insane 12.5 offensive rebounds a game and 8 defensive rebounds a game along with 24.5 points and 4 blocks.

The next closest player is Dennis Rodman in 1993-94 who averaged 8 offensive rebounds, a staggering 4.5 lower than Malone's.

I remember a while back when there was a broadcaster strike in Canada, all NHL games were shown without commentary and the audio was focused on the players’ talking, the sound of the skates on the ice, and the coaches calling plays. It gave a more intimate feel to the broadcast and was a pretty decent simulation of being in the arena.",0.9,hot,7/25/20 14:59

Some people have Curry as high as No.2 in the league while for others he’s as low as No.6.

Kawhi is regarded by some to be the No.1 guy in the whole league and is usually at least Top 5 in everyone’s lists.

Personally, if I took 2019 Curry, I’d put him over Kawhi right now. Could be an unpopular opinion. We all know Kawhi’s defense is miles better. However offense is more important than defense and Curry is an All Time All Time great on offense. 

I’d say Healthy Curry is No.3 right now and Kawhi is No.4. Counting KD by the way.

> The question that caused Wojnarowski to halt was if he had ever sent a “F–k you” email to anyone before he delivered that message to Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo) two weeks ago.

> “I regretted sending that email,” Wojnarowski told The Post after the long pause. “I have not made a habit of doing that, but I sent that one and I regret it.”

> Wojnarowski later said he had never sent an email such as that before, but he is fully regretful for his actions that led to what he thinks is the first suspension of his life, a two-week timeout without pay that has just concluded.

In regards to ESPN, he understands why he was suspended:

> “I took away focus from the company,” Wojnarowski said. “In that way, I think I let people down. It is a difficult enough time that we are living in, that the company is operating in, that everybody is having to deal with. I made it harder for everybody. That was difficult to come to grips with.”

476,[OC] Thoroughly Deconstructing How Ben Simmons' Jumpshot Horribly Regressed Between The End Of His Grade 12 Season To Now: From Fluidity to Foul,103,hxbtut,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxbtut/oc_thoroughly_deconstructing_how_ben_simmons/,43,1595660081,"**TL;DR** I LOVE LEARNING EVERYTHING I AM ABLE TO RE: SHOOTING, THEN TEACHING THIS INFO TO OTHERS

_______
NOW BACK TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING:
_______
First, let's wet our whistles with a couple videos. We'll watch how Simmons shot the ball in-game and during shootaround at the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)  
And now compare that to how he shoots the ball in shootaround in this video taken during 'rona-times (peep the masks): [https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22)

**WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.**
______

During my 15 years of coaching ball, I've done a **lot** of *probably* way too in-depth studying of how to build the most efficient, simple, and fluid jumper. This eventually led me to develop the curriculum for, and coach, my own 4 day 'Shooting Camps' where a jumper is broken down to:

**Day 1** lower body  
**Day 2** upper body pre- and during-shot  
**Day 3** upper body during- and post-release of shot  
**Day 4** everything previously learned put into the overall package of a jumpshot

Okay okay okay. We're going to look at Simmons' jumper in a similar way to how these camps were structured, starting with the foundation and working our way up... We'll look at Simmons' jumper from the Nike Hoop Summit, which was at the end of his grade 12 season, and compare it to how he shoots meow.
______

**LOWER BODY**

* We see Simmons' lower body action pre-, during-, and post-shot in ""[Clip 1: ""BEN SIMMONS CAN SHOOT 3's - Evidence of Ben Simmons three point range""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)"", from the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016, as quite consistent and close to the ideal of what you would want.

* He gathers quickly and even though it is slight, he does do a 1-2 step into the catch, allowing him to load his legs up and have them read to quickly explode up to shoot. Simmons has the lengthwise centre-line of his feet under the outside of his hipbones and the outside of each foot under each shoulder, which, IMO, is the optimal stance to find the sweet-spot between balance (and we know without proper balance in your foundation, it's going to be *hellishly* tough to shoot when moving at full-speed with defenders flying at you) and explosiveness in your jumper. You can also see he is on the balls of his feet with bouncy knees, making for great elastic energy going from his legs to his upper body when shooting the ball. Finally, his lower body is all squared to his target with his feet just *slightly* angled to the right of his target as this best brings his shooting arm's elbow to point at the basket.  

* Compared to Simmons' lower body this month in [Clip 2: 7SIXERS STAR PLAYER BEN SIMMONS SHOWS HIS LONG RANGE SHOOTING IN A PRACTICE SESSION](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22) and during this season, but pre-'rona, in [Clip 3: Pull-Up Midrange Jumper In-Game](https://youtu.be/DkqGMNhSOWU?t=102), it is all quite similar.

Hmmm the lower body may not be the problem...

* *DO NOT FORGET*: The power for shooting the ball *should* come from you lower body and shooting on the way up (a la Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II), NOT from your upper body.

**UPPER BODY**

The upper body of Ben Simmons' jumper, to quote Clive Owen in ""Inside Man"": therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.

* Simmons had, as can be seen from the [2016 Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), the ball at a high shooting pocket, with his shooting thumb above his shooting eyebrow. This was great because he could see the hoop with both eyes when the ball was up into his shooting pocket. Also, since you are lining up your shooting foot, knee, hip, elbow (his is just slightly off from lining up with the rest, but it's really not a problem), and hand straight on with your target, everything simply has to extend up and out to go straight to your target. *And* having such a high shooting pocket coupled with great height and length makes his shot extremely difficult to block.

* *HOWEVER*, now, as evidenced [here](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22), Simmons has the ball moved over more in the centre of his head with his shooting thumb more above his opposite eyebrow. This means, as his lower body is still nicely lined up with his target and has not changed for the worse since 2016, he will be flicking more across from the centre of his head to finish his follow through lined up with his lead shooting foot. He's actually shooting across to get the ball to the hoop instead of just shooting it straight to the hoop... I believe because of this--as you can see--his shooting elbow is pointed out to his left a lot more in the recent shooting clips compared to the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit clips.  

* He *needs* to get that hand solidly lined up above his shooting eyebrow as it was [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg) and bring his elbow in. This would stop him from having this wacky fling from right to left when shooting. You'll notice most of Ben's misses are either right or left of the target... this is probably because of this right to left slingshot/catapult he is doing.

* Lastly, and another MAJOR KEY (this post has no affiliation with DJ Khaled and if any resemblance to Khaled is perceived it is completely accidental) is, when looking at [Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), Simmons shot it so fluidly because he shot on the way up! It was SO fluid looking and with great timing on his release he was properly transferring all the power from his lower body to the upper body of his shot.

* BUT, looking at it meow, you can see from the [2019-20 in-season clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkqGMNhSOWU) and the [bubble shootaround](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=8) it's like you've just held the 'shoot-button' in 2k a liiiiitle too long and your MyPlayer (who looks an awful lot like Ben Simmons) has held his release until he's on the way down. What this does is cause a shooter to lose all the power from their legs--and as we mentioned previously all the power for your shot *should* come from the largest muscles of your body: your legs. Simmons is effectively only getting power from his upper body, the left-to-right fling shot motion he has developed. Probably a reason you don't generally see Simmons miss long.

*Aspiring coaches and shooters, remember this:*

* The upper body technique is what smoothly guides the ball to the centre of the hoop, whereas *power* for getting the ball to the hoop comes from the lower body in conjunction with timing your shooting release point to get the maximum power from the lower body.  
*Especially* work on using the strength of the lower body during shooting, not after you've already shot: while on your way up is the optimal time to shoot the ball as the momentum/kinetic energy from your extending lower body will fully transfer to the ball. Think about loading a spring then letting it go! That bouncy/elastic energy is what you get from properly executed lower body shooting technique. If you combine that with good upper body technique and releasing your shot on the way up, you'll then be most-efficiently transferring the energy from your legs into getting the ball to the rim.

**OVERALL**

* When you put it all together, Simmons had a fluid, efficient, and comfortable looking shot form in [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg). It was all one motion, and he shot on the way up.

* But now, Simmons holds his shot until he is on the way down; he has lost any fluidity he had and is losing all the power from his lower body. He relies on the current right-to-left slingshot flick he's developed. I'd love to see him rebuild, or return, to that earlier form.  

__________

I don't understand what the fuck happened. Maybe it will always be a mystery. But Ben, if you ever read this, please get back to how you shot before. It was just so damn fluid and effective.

477,Why Seth Curry can be the best low usage scorer of all time,97,hxbfye,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxbfye/why_seth_curry_can_be_the_best_low_usage_scorer/,30,1595658627,"This may like a ridiculous statement, but the stats back it up. This is NOT an overreaction to his perfect shooting performance last night, but rather a long-standing belief about my favorite player in the league.

Many people think Seth Curry is just a shooter, but this is far from the truth. Seth is one of the most versatile offensive players in the league, allowing him to take advantage of the many varied opportunities next to Luka in the Mavs flow offense. let’s look at his case as an elite low-usage scorer:

**AT THE RIM**

Seth shoots **72% at the rim** (82 percentile), which is considered elite for a guard. He is great at abusing mismatches brought by the mavs offense and creating his own shots. He’s in the 90th percentile in efficiency scoring off drives and the 75th percentile scoring in PnR. He has a lot of skill controlling the big man on the inside, having the ability to freeze the big at the rim by feinting an attack, only to hit a short fade or hit him with a deadly floater. 


**IN THE MIDRANGE**

Seth is **1st in the league in midrange fg%** (minimum 50 attempts) at **57%** on above average volume. He has one of the most accurate middy floaters in the league, and he is deadly on long 2s, shooting **56% from 16ft-3p, good for 3rd in the league**. To put it simply, he’s the best low-usage midrange player in the NBA


**FROM 3**

I know I don’t have to tell anyone this, but Seth is an all-time great shooter. He is **2nd all-time in career 3p% 44.3%** and **2nd this season in 3p% at 45.3%**. He is always ready to pull the trigger, averaging **7.1 3p attempts per 36**, and his movement off ball, as well as the defense Luka draws, creates plenty of opportunity. 

After reading about his incredible efficiency on every part of the floor, it may not surprise you that, if he had enough minutes to qualify, Seth would be **11th all-time in career ts%, right behind Reggie Miller**



**IF HE’S SO GREAT, WHY HAS HE PLAYED BACKUP MINUETS HIS WHOLE CAREER?**

Unfortunately for Seth, he is the size of a PG while having the play-style of a SG. This makes it difficult for most teams to play him with a primary playmaker without sacrificing too much size (not an issue with the Mavs, considering their PG is 6’7 and guards forwards). Seth is not a bad defender, but he isn’t nearly good enough to make up for his positional awkwardness. This, combined with the fact that he was a late bloomer and didn’t get playing time until his late 20’s, means he’s just now getting his first real shot at being an important piece. 


**IN SUMMARY**

I believe if Seth was given the full-time starting role can score 18-20 a game on fairly low usage with near league-best efficiency (as he was after being reinstated into the starting rotation midway through the season), being third scoring in scoring on a championship level team.",0.91,hot,7/24/20 23:30

Michael Jordan's championship seasons are all top 25 scoring seasons of all time (regular season + post season). There are different methodologies for ranking scoring seasons but regardless of what methodology is used all six of Jordan's championships seasons will be somewhere around the top only.

This is very special because when we think of great scorers like Kobe and Harden they had to sort of dial back their scoring in order to allow the team to function better as a whole. Jordan also sacrificed but not to the same extent -- he was still averaging 30+ ppg in both the regular season and post season, or close to it, in his championship seasons. There are possible reasons for this, such as the lack of zone defenses at the time. But even then, that is truly remarkable and pretty much sums up why Michael Jordan is the GOAT.",0.64,hot,7/25/20 6:32
480,[OC] Why Kyle Kuzma sucks,1,hxvbdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxvbdp/oc_why_kyle_kuzma_sucks/,0,1595743974,"OFFICIAL r/FuckKyleKuzma Bible.

1. Kuzma shoots **29%** from three (6% below league average) and **43%** (3% below league average).  While already incredibly inefficient, these numbers become worse when you realize that Kuzma often shares the floor with a superstar such as LeBron James or Anthony Davis or both.  These superstars, while not only possessing otherworldly court vision, the defense often collapses and contorts to contain them.  These numbers elude to the fact that while Kuzma's looks may be rather uncontested or low in difficulty, **Kuzma either lacks the basketball IQ to select high percentage shots, or just lacks scoring talent.  Considering how Kuzma is a strictly offensive minded forward, these numbers are concerning for Lakers fans to say the least.**

2. While Kyle Kuzma's usage rate has been steady at around **21%-23%** compared to his previous two seasons, Kuzma averages **5.2** less points than last year.  **Stable usage and decreased scoring over multiple seasons means a drastic drop in efficiency.**

3. Kuzma's assist to turnover ratio, AST/TO is **.8**, and the lowest of the Laker's guards and forwards by a considerable margin.  This means he is more likely to turn the ball over than he is to set another player up for a score.  For reference, **Kentavious Caldwell Pope, a player who earns similar minutes and plays on the wings with Kuzma  AST/TO is 2.6, 1.8** ***higher.***

4. Kuzma's net rating is **5.3**.  Net rating can be defined as a metric to measure how much better or worse a team becomes when a player is on the floor.  While Kuzma has a positive net rating, the Laker's average net rating is **7.4**.  **The Lakers, a contending team with nearly 50 wins becomes inherently worse when Kuzma is on the floor.**  Kuzma's net rating is no doubt where it is because of the talent around him, and not himself.

5. While Kuzma is an offensive minded forward, his defense has somehow regressed from previous seasons.  Kuzma's struggles on the defensive end have been well documented by Laker fans, as he lacks the foot speed and defensive IQ to guard the more talented small forwards, but also lacks the strength and low post presence to contain power forwards.  This is proven by Kyle's **Defensive Box Plus/Minus** which calculates a players efficiency at stopping an opposing player from scoring, adjusting to a league average team.  Kuzma's is **-1.3, proving him to be a defensive liability.**  Kuzma does not lack the frame nor wingspan to be an effective defender, seemingly just the effort.

6. This the one that pisses me off the most.  While I dont have any fancy metrics or advanced stats to prove, Kuz seems more concerned with being an Instagram model than an NBA player.  Kuzma did a Vanity Fair photo shoot February 11th, one day before the Lakers pivotal February 12th matchup with the at the time 2nd place Denver Nuggets before the All Star Break.  Kuzma dropped 3 points, and had a plus minus of **-11.**  Furthermore, Coach Frank Vogel wisely decided against playing Kuzma in crunch time, instead opting those minutes to former two-way guard Alex Caruso.  **I'm sure there are many more instances of Kuz pulling shit like this, but I don't have the patience nor will power to scroll through his social medias and cross reference his shitty performances.**


I'm sure there is a mountain of evidence and statistics to prove that the Lakers should've dumped Kuz during the deadline when they had the chance, but I regress.  I feel I have encapsulated Kuz's offensive and defensive incompetency, as well as his reluctance to contribute to a contending NBA basketball team.  To simplify and summarize the article, Kuz has regressed majorly on offense, is a defensive liability, and makes the Lakers worse when he steps onto the floor.

Has potential to be the best in the league some day but right now his shooting isn't good enough. Regardless, the threat of his stepback three opens up opportunities, and the kid is an absolutely lethal scorer on drives.

**4. Lebron James**

It's not really his game but he's still a threat in isolation. His jumper has become respectable over the years. And a Lebron James drive to the rim is one of the most unstoppable scoring moves. 

**3. Damian Lillard**

Well-rounded three level scorer who was kinda forced to iso a lot this season with how decimated his team was. One of the best shooters in the NBA. 

**2. Kawhi Leonard**

Another lethal three level scorer. At points, he kept the Raptors afloat last postseason by constantly taking iso midrange shots. Strong and smart enough to get to his spots. 

**1. James Harden**

The iso king. He'll either take a high percentage stepback three, or drive for a high percentage shot at the rim or a foul. Harden isos could be a team's entire offense.

**Honorable Mention: Kevin Durant**

Sick scorer who would be #2 on this list when healthy with an argument for #1 over Harden. But I've left him off the list since we don't know what he'll look like post Achilles tear.",0.83,hot,7/25/20 1:30

He has an old man game that can slot into the 2000s quite seamlessly and he's shown his ability to step up when it matters and when the guy co-stars for isn't around, his only hiccup having been last year and even then it was because he spent a good deal of the Raptors series guarding someone who is arguably one of the best players in the NBA in Kawhi Leonard.

I'm not saying he'd be an insanely amazing addition for a team at that point in time, I'm just saying he'd be a great floor raiser on a good team in that era.",0.56,hot,7/25/20 17:35

He’s an amazing person (although not to the media), he’s worked his tail off, he’s an MVP and an all time great. It seems like people consider him low IQ? Or a ballhog/stat padder?

I'm interested to see how some of the players adjust to a calmer environment, and whether less attention harms or benefits different players in the league.

486,My NBA Awards for the 2019-20 season,22,hxekxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxekxo/my_nba_awards_for_the_201920_season/,40,1595670799,"So this is basically my award show, aka the players I think who won the award this year. And I know we still got 8 games left, and it could sway the voters a little bit, but for the most part, I feel like it is safe to say that we most likely know who the award is going to. So without further ado, let us get on with it. 

1. Sixth Man Of The Year- Dennis Schroder of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Now, this one maybe a little controversial, since a lot of you were expecting Lou Will or Montrezl Harrell to win this award, as they have put up great numbers coming off the bench. But I cannot deny the story behind OKC's success this season. Coming into the season, we did not expect OKC to be where they are, but with the help of their three-headed guard lineup of CP3. Shai, and Schroder, they have outplayed everyone's expectations. Coming off the bench, he is putting up 19.0 points on 46.8% from the field, and 38.1% from three on 5.1 attempts per game, which is the most threes he as attempted per game in his entire career, which shows that he has worked on his game in the off-season, as three point-shooting was a major problem in his career. Also, I assume voter fatigue will kick in for the voters, and after seeing the Cinderella story of OKC, and how much of a factor Schroder played in their success, I feel like he will most then likely get this award. 
2. Most Improved Player Of The Year- Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat. At this point, it should be in debates of whether or not Bam should win the award unanimously. I mean, let me put it this way; the guy went from starting 28 of his 82 games in the 2018-19 season, averaging a mere 8.9 points and 7.3 rebounds, to the center piece of the Miami Heat on both sides of the floor, averaging 16.8 points on 56.7% from the field, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks a game. This dude literally improved in every major statistical stat, and is now considered the prototype for the modern NBA Center. The man can do it all: he can handle the rock, be a great playmaker, a strong rim runner, and be a defensive monster either on the perimeter or in the paint (his world class strength and athleticism does help in this factor as well). The only thing he needs to add in his bag is a shot, and that is coming his way. But even without it, at the young age of 22, he is considered a top 5 center, a dark horse contender for Defensive Player of the year, and might get his first spots on the all-nba and all-defensive teams. 
3. And Speaking of Defensive Player Of The Year- Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. This was the hardest for me to vote on (yes, even harder than the MVP). I mean, you got 4 different candidates, who equally have the potential to win this award. You got the reigning DPOY winner in Rudy Gobert, who is having yet again another stellar season in anchoring the defense of the Jazz (which has kind of slipped from second to the eleventh place), averaging 13.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. We got Anthony Davis, who 9.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 2.4 blocks a game, while being the best defender on the floor for the Lakers, who have the third best defense in the league. You also got Ben Simmons, who leads the league in steals, at 2.2 steals a game, and his size gives him the ability to for real to guard positions from the 1 to the 5, as he is the most switchable and best guard defender in the league. But man, I got to keep it a buck with you (pun intended), Giannis is by far the best defender in the league. His mere 1.0 steal and 1.0 block a game may not be seen as valuable, but the man passes the eye test (and he does lead the league in most of the advanced defensive stats, when a player has played over 40 games). He has made this bucks defense one of the greatest of all time, and I cannot deny that, and so the award (according to me), rightfully goes to him.
4. Rookie Of The Year- Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies. This is almost as clear cut as the Most Improved Player Award, but with the bubble rules, this can change. You know what, nevermind, I'm still sticking with my guy Ja. The dude has been spectacular this season, and has put the Grizzlies on a good path for the future. No one expected him to take this team to the eight seed, and yet there they are. 17.6 points on 49.9% from the field, and 36.7% from three on 2.6 attempts per game, and 6.9 assists per game, which means he leads all rookies in total points and assists. Regardless of how good Zion has played since he came back to the pelicans in mid January, Ja has been ballin from the start, and I cannot deny the body of work, and how much the grizzlies have surpassed our expectations.
5. And speaking of surpassing our expectations, Coach Of The Year- Nick Nurse of the Toronto Raptors. Imagine this scenario. You are the NBA Champions, as you were lead there by the best player on your team. You expect him to return to your squad, but instead he hitches the wagon on the LA trail and heads west. You are then expected to be good, but not be contenders for trying to repeat as back-to-back champions. But then, you break all expectations and maybe in a good spot to repeat as NBA Champions. That is the Toronto Raptors this season, who are lead by an emerging star in Pascal Siakam, a good/underrated point guard in Kyle Lowry, and the defensive minded head coach in Nick Nurse. Despite losing the best two-way player in the game in Kawhi Leonard, the raptors have still managed to be a top 15 offensive team, and the second best defensive team in the league, and that is because of the good defensive scheme that is run by Coach Nurse, who for sure deserves this award. 
6. And finally, The Most Valuable Player- Lebron Ja..... Nah, I'm just playing. It has to go to the Greek Freak, aka Giannis Antetokounmpo  of the Milwaukee Bucks. Now, I know I have pissed off a lot of Lebron Stans, and they are waiting to call me a hater in the comments. But before you do so, I just want to make my points heard. Giannis is averaging 29.6 points on 54.7% from the field, and 30.6% from three on 4.8 attempts a game (which is an improvement from last year). He is also averaging 13.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists, and is the motor behind a bucks team that has a top 10 offense, and an historic defense as mentioned earlier. He is also doing this on 30.9 minutes per game, and without a co-star (not to diss Middleton. He is good. But for those of you Lebron Stans, would you rather have AD or Middleton as your co-star). He has also learned how to be a better leader, as he has improved on minute errors in his game, and is able to squeeze more wins out of his playstyle. Although Lebron has had a great comeback season, I am sorry, but I am going to have to give this one to Giannis.  

But there they are my awards. What do you guys think? Did I get them correct? Do comment down below your thoughts.",0.69,hot,7/25/20 2:53

489,My top 3 most improved players of the 2019-20 NBA season,14,hxddxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxddxs/my_top_3_most_improved_players_of_the_201920_nba/,50,1595665990,"1. Brandon Ingram 


Ingram has taken his level to a complete different level this season. His major improvements have come from his 3pt shooting and his free throw shooting which has seen his TS% rise from 55% to 59% while increasing his PPG by 6 points. His also averaging career highs in PPG, RPG, APG and SPG. He also made his first all star team in a tough western conference.


2. Bam Adebayo 

Bam has gone from a promising young player last year to an all star this year. He is averaging career highs in all major statistics and also averaging a double double. Although his TS% has lowered by 2% he still has an above average TS% of 60%. Maybe his biggest improvement has been his playmaking and passing. He’s averaging 3 more assists and also registered 3 triple doubles. 


3. Luka Doncic 


Everyone knows about the steps Luka has taken this year. He’s been arguable a top 3 player this season which is a massive improvement. The only knock on his case is the fact 2nd year players rarely win the award.

Of course there are generational players like Zion, Lebron and Kobe who could compete as teenagers. But look at a player like Kevin Knox who hasnt fully developed, and thus his potential is largely unknown but the Knicks are now in a dilemma bc his rookie contract is almost up and they have to decide to whether to extend him based upon perceived potential. And I'm not picking on Knox as I'm sure every team has a Knox. But I'm wondering whether it's more prudent to draft an older, more mature college player. What are your thoughts?",0.55,hot,7/25/20 14:06

1) The versatile skilled type of scorers. These are the guys like MJ, Kobe, Carmelo, Hakeem, KD. These are the guys that have several scoring moves.

2) The scorers that rely a lot on athleticism. These are the guys that rely on athleticism more than versatility. Guys like Shaq, Giannis, Zion and Lebron. These guys are typically the more efficient than the other two kinds of scorers

3) The scorers that spam one or two really, really effective, unstoppable moves. These are the guys like Curry, Harden and Kareem. They aren't as versatile as number 1 or as athletic as number 2. But they have 1 or 2 moves that are so effective that it more than makes up for it.

So what exactly makes a scorer? The ones that are versatile, the ones that rely on athleticism and more efficient, or the ones that spam one or two really unstoppable moves?",0.52,hot,7/25/20 9:51

When Richaun Holmes left the bubble to get a chicken wing food delivery, he likely made contact with 1-2 people before rejoining the bubble. While this was wrong of him, he got a 10 day quarantine which I think is excessive but not unwarranted.

Zion leaves the bubble for a family matter. While he likely came to the league to discuss this, he only got 4 days of quarantine even though he likely made contact with many more people

Lou Williams leaves the bubble for a family matter and then is CAUGHT going out to party and hang out with people outside the bubble, no quarantine or punishment announced. 

Is this a market issue? Or just something that the league didn’t think about? Pardon my skepticism, I’m a kings fan

Edit: Zion was continually being tested outside of the bubble, which is why his quarantine was shorter. This doesn’t excuse the NBA’s lack of a punishment for Lou",0.38,hot,7/25/20 18:17

I'd imagine Lebron, Giannis, and Westbrook would be towards the top while Jokic would be dead last. I'd also love to hear how you qualify athleticism. By nature I think bigger guys are less mobile and therefore less athletic which is why a guy like Giannis is so impressive. No idea how to sort the middle, but my ranking is something like this:

Giannis

Lebron

Westbrook

Davis

Dame

Harden

Kawhi

Embiid

Luka

CP3

Jokic

That got me thinking about this. In the NBA, we are so focused on players ""getting to their spots"" whether in the midrange or from 3. They have a stroke down from that certain distance. However the margin for error in shots is very slim from going in and rimming out, so would moving the hoop slightly while keeping the same lines on the court affect them? How would players fare in the short term? Long term, I think NBA players are good enough to where they'll be able to adjust.",0.6,hot,7/25/20 4:58
500,Players capable of winning DPOY and MVP in the same year within the next few years,12,hx6xmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx6xmq/players_capable_of_winning_dpoy_and_mvp_in_the/,72,1595643330,"There have only been a handful of players to have won DPOY and MVP in the same year including Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan. Here are the current NBA players capable of winning both awards in the same year.

5. Joel Embiid

I wish I could put Joel higher, but availability has to count for something. Joel has missed almost 20 games every season (he was on pace to play more games this year to be fair). When it comes to an award like DPOY, we all know Embiid is capable of showing that he is one of the best defenders in the league, however, since bigs like AD and Gobert are still a slight notch above him defensively. In my opinion, Joel had an underrated season last year and was both a monster on the defensive and offensive end. His production on both ends has gotten lower this year, and obviously that can be attributed to fit, but since this Sixers team has locked this roster for the next few years I kept him here.  Assuming he doesn't get any major injuries, he has around 7 prime years to win both awards.

(I wouldn't argue if you swapped 5 and 4 as I think they are pretty close)

4. Paul George

I have Paul George so low, because he I feel like there is no way he could give an MVP and DPOY case while on the same team with Kawhi. Last year Paul George was in contention for both awards, but when it came to voting he wasn't even close to getting DPOY or MVP. PG has around 4 more prime years left: one those years will be on the Clippers, so its more like 3 years for him since I doubt he wins either award on the same team with him. If PG decides next year to go to a team where he is the main star I think it is possible for him to win DPOY in the future; however, I don't see him being able to significantly top the production he had in OKC last year and put himself above future competition like Giannis or Luka Doncic. (I know Paul George didn't play as many games this season, but has been pretty healthy for the last 4 years)

3. Kawhi Leonard

It feels odd to put Kawhi so high yet in a way so low. These are all regular season awards, and like Embiid, availability needs to count for something. Kawhi has played fewer games for the past three years. In his last real year in San Antonio he was fairly close to winning both awards in the same year, but since then he hasn't seem to give as much regard for the regular season. It is more likely that he could win another DPOY. Though he is great at creating his own shot, has developed as a passer, I have doubts he will significantly increase his offensive production to the level like Giannis, LeBron, Luka, etc.

2. Anthony Davis

Anthony Davis is on track to  finish top 4 in MVP voting and top 3 in DPOY. Considering he is the second offensive option next to LeBron, it's impressive he's this high in MVP voting. To be fair, AD has also dealt with lack of availability, but has come closer to winning MVP or DPOY than players like Embiid. Like Kawhi I think he has a better chance to win DPOY in the near future than MVP. Getting these awards will obviously depend on what he does in free agency, but assuming he resigns with the Lakers I think he would have an okay chance at winning both awards in the same year (assuming LeBron takes a step back at some point in the next few years).

1.Giannis Antetokounmpo

Giannis is already on track to win his second MVP this year and also on track to finish as the DPOY as well. Award voting will only be considering whatever games players played before suspension and Giannis has come the closest to winning both awards in the same year within recent years. So if we are talking about future seasons, unless Giannis gets injured I don't think there should be doubt that he has the highest chance of winning both awards in the same year within the next few years.",0.75,hot,7/24/20 19:15
501,The Spurs Young Guns - Dejounte Murray,16,hx4lxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx4lxh/the_spurs_young_guns_dejounte_murray/,23,1595636015,"Hearing everyone associated with the organization repeating over and over again that these bubble games will be for the young guys got me properly fired up. We’ve waited all season to see these guys on the court together, and they didn’t waste any time getting to it. In this series of posts I’ll look at how each Spur on a rookie contract is progressing, how they performed in their first game back, and what I hope to see the rest of this bubble. 

Dejounte Murray - The head of the snake when it comes to the teams young core. It’s easy to see how much excitement the organization has had for him over the last three years and the progression of his jump shot this season showed us a glimpse of the player he could become in the coming years. 

Defense
The havoc Dejounte can cause on the defensive side of the ball was still apparent on Thursday. While that didn’t manifest itself in counting stats, the film shows how he impacts defense by blowing up actions off ball, hounding ball handlers in the pick and roll, and seemingly being in 2 places at once. He’s incredible aggressive, but nearly always finds a way to recover. While not quite the outlier he was rebounding the ball during his second season, he remains elite for his position and can truly impact the game giving the team extra possessions and pushing the break. He could be more disciplined in his rotations and attacking the glass, but in reality nothing on the defensive side of the ball gives me pause. 

Offense
On the other side of the court things are still very much a work in progress. He has always had great touch with his floater and we saw that Thursday. Multiple times he hit a little half runner/half jumper in the lane to avoid the contest from the big, and while he has become very efficient at that shots, the reason he has needed to use it so much is concerning. DJ struggled mightily to finish at the rim with the Lopez brothers and Giannis waiting in the wings. While he has very good vertical pop, he is not strong enough to explode in traffic. Too often he is eaten up by the big, who hardly even feels to the contact DJ initiates to try to get the shot off. His jumper didn’t look incredible today, but the foundation is there with his touch and improved form. The more he shoots the more comfortable he will become, and I am very high on his shooting upside considering his development arc. His passing is always an adventure. I am still not sure if he has the requisite vision needed to really drive a high level offense. He makes some really nice passes occasionally, but he hardly makes reads that show he understands the rotation the defense is going to make and how to actually maximize that advantage. He’s okay at hitting shooters in the pick and roll, but is much better hitting the roller where he can find creative angles to make the pass in a crowded space. I think he has the upside to be an All Star PG, but that is driven by his scoring ability and defensive playmaking. I think he will be best utilized in an offense with at least one other perimeter player with plus vision and creation equity if he doesn’t make a leap in that regard. 

Scrimmage Recap
The scrimmage for Dejounte really felt like an extension of the season. When he’s being aggressive attacking in PnR and in transition he can be really dangerous, but if his shot isn’t falling it can muck up his whole game. Having athletic defenders alongside him that can rotate well and cover for when he gets overeager is important, and I think the lineup with Derrick White and Lonnie Walker starting alongside him has a ton of upside. 

Looking Forward 
What I am looking for most through the rest of the bubble games from Dejounte is first improved chemistry playing with DWhite. I think he is a perfect foil for DJ (as long as Derrick actually shoots 3’s, more on that in my next post). He’s very steady in his rotations and very rarely gambles. He’s significantly sturdier than DJ and the two of them could make the best defensive backcourt in the league. DWhite also offers a little more passing vision and a steadier hand when running the offense, which helps paper over some of DJs limitations. Allowing DWhite to bring up the ball up and initiate the offense will give Dejounte more opportunity to shoot off the catch, attack close outs, and poach offensive rebounds. More specifically to Dejounte’s game, I would like to see some growth from him as a passer, using his quickness to break down the defense and punish teams for sending an extra man. With some added weight this offseason I think he’ll find ways to finish better around the basket (remember he is still coming back from a torn ACL where he got down to about 160 pounds at 6’4, so this season was always going to be tough) and I think his shooting will continue to improve. If he is going to make the leap into being the teams best player and leader moving forward a little improvement in vision and pass accuracy would go a long way.",0.94,hot,7/24/20 17:13

505,Life after COVID: Will the bubble's lack of courtside seats and baseline cameras translate to arenas?,1,hxe83k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxe83k/life_after_covid_will_the_bubbles_lack_of/,12,1595669323,"As we've seen in the initial bubble scrimmages, the courts look huge in comparison to pre-covid teams' arenas. The sidelines are much wider out of bounds, and the baselines have plenty of stopping room. The floors themselves are likely the same size, but the lack of peripheral people along the court boundaries provides tons of new, safe space for player movement.

No more worries about crashing into chairs (there's a solid wall), nor getting bashed by a camera. 

Will players get used to this improved safety boundary so that they will need it when teams return to arenas with fans?

Personally, I think players would be better off if the floors were clear always like this.

I think additional cameras will eventually be added, but perhaps with distancing concerns they will opt to use higher magnification and film from a distance.

507,"After a relatively disappointing 26-14 start to the 1989-90 season for the Pistons, head coach Chuck Daly inserted Dennis Rodman into the starting lineup. The Detroit went on to win 25 of their next 26 games.",609,hweumt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hweumt/after_a_relatively_disappointing_2614_start_to/,33,1595536472,"Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rodmade01/gamelog/1990/  
  
For more context, In 1989 the Pistons won 63 games and swept the Lakers in the finals. To be playing at *just* a 53 win pace early through the first half of the season was very disappointing for the Pistons who were widely expected to be competing for a championship again.  
  
After 40 games, Rodman had yet to start for Detroit, however his immediate addition to the starting lineup was the spark for the Pistons. His defensive impact and offensive rebounding ability saw the Pistons regain their elite form which would see them finish 1st in the East and 2nd in the entire league standings.  
  
He was acknowledged accordingly this season winning his first of two DPOY's in a close call with Hakeem Olajuwon. People acknowledge Rodman for his elite defence and for being arguably the GOAT rebounder and this instance here shows why.  
  
After conceding the fewest points in the league in 1990, the Pistons would repeat that feat in 1991 and 1992 with Rodman starting nearly every game. In his first season with the Spurs beginning in 1993 the team conceded the second fewest PPG against in the league after being 9th the year prior. He truly was a massively impact player, regardless of how you value the supporting cast around him.",0.98,hot,7/23/20 13:34

After center Clint Capela was shipped out of Texas and 3&D-specialist Robert Covington was launched into Houston to create a positionless, undersized starting lineup, the Rockets have been one of the league's most unique and entertaining teams. In addition to unleashing a newly-efficient Russell Westbrook on offense with the spacing accrued via eliminating a traditional center, the Rockets' defense has become quite interesting as well, forced to defend teams sans a 7-foot rim-protector.

This is far from the first time we've seen the Rockets going small, mind you. PJ Tucker was used very often at the 5-spot in the Rockets' previous two postseason tussles against the all-conquering KD-Warriors, stretching the Dubs out with shooters and taking one of the strongest offenses ever out of their rhythm with their switching defense.

From [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-with-robert-covington-radical-rockets-are-going-small-and-thinking-big-on-defense/):

>*""With defense, we think you have to start at the perimeter and be solid there,"" (Rockets GM) Daryl Morey told USA Today's Mark Medina. ""Unfortunately, rim protection is really difficult these days with the rules that they are if a guy is getting downhill. It's very hard even if the center is back to handle that. You have to cut off penetration at the start with a strong perimeter and then get the rebound and get out and go.""*

>*You don't need rim protection if you don't let anybody near the rim in the first place. And the Rockets, with their commitment to switching and their collection of strong, quick wings, believe they have the personnel to prove it. This is a big swing. Houston ranks 15th in defensive rating, and it needs to dramatically improve to win a title. Ideally, Covington will make the Rockets' defense look like the one that jammed up the Golden State Warriors' system in the conference finals two years ago and hasn't been the same since. That team was a pain to play against. Houston switched aggressively, with smart perimeter defenders like P.J. Tucker and Trevor Ariza who understood how to kill the rhythm of a possession. The results weren't beautiful to watch, exactly -- it essentially dared the other team to go matchup-hunting and try to score in isolation -- but the execution was impressive.*

#So individually, how have players performed since Covington joined the team?

The Rockets have now played 14 games with Covington on the floor before the NBA suspended its season. Here are some player averages since Covington officially entered the side:

Name| Games played (games started), Minutes| Pts/Rbs/Ast/Stl/Blk| FG% | 3PA, 3P% | TS%, rTS% (league-average TS% = 56.4)  
---|---|----|----|----|----
James Harden| 14 (14), 35.2| **29.4**/5.9/7.5/2.0/0.6| 43.1 | 11.4, 32.5 |  60.7, +4.3
Russell Westbrook | 11 (11), 35.9| **31.7**/8.2/5.5/1.7/0.2|  **54.6** | 2.4, 38.5|  **59.3, +2.9**
Danuel House Jr.| 14 (14), 27.5| 9.1/3.6/1.7/1.1/0.4| 42.9 | 4.6, 30.8 | 56.2, -0.2 
Robert Covington *(new addition)*| 14 (13), 32.6| 12.8/7.9/1.3/1.1/**2.5**| 42.1 | **8.0, 35.7** | 56.6, +0.2 
PJ Tucker| 14 (14), 31.5 | 6.0/5.9/1.3/0.7/0.7|  42.3 | 3.9, 40.0| 58.4, +2.0 

- **Westbrook** has taken up more more scoring duties (**31.7 ppg**, up from 26.4 ppg in 41 games prior). His efficiency (**59.3 TS%**, up from 52.4 TS%) has *exploded* with the improved 5-out spacing and better shot selection (fewer 3s) allowing him to attack the rim mercilessly, feasting in open space.


- **Harden**, in return, has ramped down his own scoring load slightly (29.4 ppg, down from 35.8 ppg in 47 games prior). His efficiency and playmaking have remained largely unchanged.


- **House** has seemingly become a mainstay in this new-look lineup, with his defense, hustle, plus-rebounding for his position (4 rebs/game), decent shooting (36.3 3p% on 5.3 3pa over the season), and passable ability to make plays off double-teams. **Eric Gordon** could replace House if he regains form, as he was a full-time starter during Houston's last postseason run and was highly effective in his role (18ppg, 60ts%, 40% from 3 on 8 3pa/game, plus-defense). **Jeff Green** (10/3/1 on 41% from 3) and **DeMarre Carroll** (6/3/1 on 62 TS%), brand-new Rockets, may see some postseason playing time as well if they continue to perform well, though that's never guaranteed considering MDA's notoriously stingy playoff rotations. **Austin Rivers** and **Ben McLemore** also provide important sparks off the bench with ancillary spacing and scoring.

#Covington and Tucker's defense

The Rockets are almost guaranteed to flourish on the offensive end, with 2 of the league's best offensive guards now surrounded by ample spacing, allowing the team to create Moreyball-friendly shots at the rim and 3-point-line almost at will. 

What will determine if they do go far in the playoffs, then, will be whether their undersized **defense** can slow down playoff offenses, and **Robert Covington and PJ Tucker** are key in determining whether Houston flourishes or flames out. 

**[Covington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eog0kLAZHyI)** is an All-Defensive forward capable of rebounding (8 rebs/game) and shooting 3s at a very high volume (8.0 3pa/game), but his most important role on this team is being one of the NBA's most disruptive and impactful team defenders, both willing *and* able to switch onto bigs and provide effective weakside rim-protection (2.5 blks/game). [As Daryl Morey himself has asserted](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-with-robert-covington-radical-rockets-are-going-small-and-thinking-big-on-defense/), *""He's very good off the ball, knowing how to position himself, anticipate, get steals, deny passing lanes"".* On the ball, RoCo's no Kawhi but he's still a highly capable man-defender: his 7-2 wingspan and sprightly frame combined with great footwork and positioning allow him to bother anyone he's switched onto. 

**[Tucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVoceFL96E)**, in addition to being a good outside shooter (37% from 3 on 4.3 attempts/game in last 3 seasons) and rebounder (7 rebs/game this season), is the defensive hub of this team and their do-it-all small-ball center on defense. He can switch onto any player in the league, with excellent footwork enabling him to keep up with [shifty guards](https://i.imgur.com/mXymyzg.gifv) and his strength and powerful hands allowing him to [bother bigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVoceFL96E&t=34s) in the post - Tucker is 6-6 and 245 pounds, built like a middle linebacker. He's also very cerebral, knowing opponent tendencies and often beating players to their spots. PJ is constantly communicating with the rest of his teammates, calling out switches and consistently making smart and effective rotations of his own (he is 4th in the NBA in charges drawn). 

**When on the court together, they've been incredibly effective defensively so far.**  [According to SB Nation's Mike Prada](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/3/4/21163408/houston-rockets-robert-covington-p-j-tucker-defense-rim-protection), *""Houston allows teams to shoot just 59.1 percent at the basket with that combination (PJ and RoCo) in the game, according to [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/11/lineups?on=739&on=3715#tab-shooting_defense_fg). That’s on par with the Lakers’ mark when Anthony Davis and JaVale McGee share the floor... 2.5 percentage points better than the 76ers surrender with Joel Embiid on the court, nearly three percentage points better than Jazz opponents shoot with Gobert on the floor.""*

So, how have they accomplished this?

Well, PJ and RoCo ""aren’t rim protectors, but they do everything a great rim protector does, along with so much more."" 

>Their lateral quickness is solid, but that’s not why they are able to stop so many different kinds of drives before they get to the rim. The reason they do is they have chests and hips of steel. To be successful at staying vertical and altering shots at the basket, one needs a strong enough chest to absorb a blow without losing balance and lowering your hands. Great perimeter defense in the anti-handcheck era is also about having a strong enough chest to absorb a blow without losing balance. Covington and Tucker, then, are essentially maintaining verticality, except further out on the floor.

>Tucker and (especially) Covington also eat up space as help defenders. Both are adept at swarming to the ball, and both do an excellent job of helping the helper so the next pass isn’t open. They ensure the weak Rockets defenders aren’t exposed in space.

>How does this make the Rockets tough to score against at the hoop when both share the floor? Consider the build of a prototypical rim protector: tall, strong, long, and able to keep those arms straight while in mid-air. Those traits seem essential because we think of big men as the type of players who can meet players at the apex of their jump. If P.J. Tuckington had to meet drivers at the apex of their jump, “he” will lose because “he” is not tall. But that’s only a problem if they actually reach the apex of their jump. By wedging their way into tight help positions and staying there due to the power of their lower body, Tucker and Covington ensure that anyone who tries to finish over them can’t in practice because they don’t have enough space to leap their highest.

>(Covington and Tucker) are each portable brick walls — or at least hand-held shields the Rockets can deploy anywhere. They allow the Rockets to string together crucial defensive possessions.

**Individually**, they're both shutdown artists: 

- PJ: harrassing and eventually denying [Kemba Walker](https://i.imgur.com/mXymyzg.gifv)  at the rim, shadowing  [Mike Conley's ](https://i.imgur.com/L0yq2Vb.gifv) drive to the rim and bothering his shot attempt, stone-walling [Daniel Theis and Gordon Hayward](https://i.imgur.com/T23fnJe.gifv).

- RoCo: picking up [Jaylen Brown](https://i.imgur.com/GPtpvFi.gifv), making himself a nuisance to [Donovan Mitchell](https://i.imgur.com/UrlpcqF.gifv), beating a spinning [LeBron James ](https://i.imgur.com/sN8zjpo.gifv) to his spot and forcing a turnover.

**Together**, they're poetry in motion, working in-sync beautifully to defend the paint and stop penetration, constantly helping the helper, plugging up gaps, and making timely and crucial rotations to keep the Rockets D humming:

#Early returns: Team performances

Results have been a mixed bag, with the Rockets going 8-6 in Covington's 14 games. 

**There are some impressive wins in there**: 1-point and 11-point wins vs Boston, a 10-point win vs the Lakers, and another 10-point win vs Utah. Strong offense combined with a locked-in and stingy switching defense allowed them to hold their own and prevail against some strong sides, taking numerous opponent scorers out of their rhythm (LeBron's 18 pts on 45 ts%, Tatum's 15 pts on 40 ts% and 32 pts on 48 ts%, Kemba's 14 pts on 32 ts%, Bojan 12 pts on 48 ts%).

**The losses, though**, range from more 'reasonable' ones that at least came against other playoff sides (15-point blowout loss vs Clippers, 1-point loss vs Jazz), to **a string of head-scratching upsets by below-.500 teams** (36-point massacre at the hands of the Suns, 2-point loss vs Knicks, 9-point loss vs Hornets, and a 20-point thwacking by the Magic). 

Some of this may have been a matter of size-disadvantage or Houston seemingly dialing down their effort-levels against lesser opposition and paying dearly for it: **they were out-rebounded by Phoenix 29-51, by the Knicks 34-65, and by the Magic 38-49.**

The **Clippers** didn't hold a significant rebound-advantage (57-51, shoutout to WB's 15 rebs) and Paul George had a rough offensive outing against the Rockets' switching defense (13pts on 43 ts%) but Kawhi remained as efficient as ever (25/6/5 on 66 ts%), while Clippers bigs **Zubac and Harrell both feasted** in the paint (17/12 on 98 ts% and 19/10 on 71 ts% respectively). Combined with an **extremely cold Harden shooting night** (4-17 fg, 36 ts%) and an **inefficient Westbrook one** (46ts%), it was not awfully surprising that Houston lost this game.

As for the 9-point loss to the Hornets, Westbrook missed this game. Houston actually outrebounded their opponents for once (42-30), but Harden's inefficient and relatively sloppy offensive night (53 ts% and 10 turnovers) as Houston's sole playmaker likely sealed Houston's fate, combined with white-hot shooting (67 ts%) from the entire Hornets team.


#All in all...
Houston had a +1.5 net rating in these 14 games. This is likely weighed down slightly by some of those aforementioned ugly blowout defeats (outscored by 56 points combined vs the Suns and Magic).  **Against good teams, the Rockets have been quite competitive on the whole: 4-2 record against teams w/ above .500 record, with a +2.7 net rating.** As long as they're locked-in and remain healthy, Houston absolutely have a fighter's chance of punching above their weight during the upcoming postseason run.

From mid February to mid March of 1987, the Lakers played 15 games. They won 14 of them. However, what really caught my eye was how elite Magic played during that specific stretch. 

He averaged 23.7 PTS, 16.1(!) ASTs and 7.4 TRB, on 57.5% FG. 1.5 STLs and 4.3 TOVs. 

The Lakers as a team scored 128, 121, 138, 122, 136, 143, 125, and 147 points in a game at different points during this stretch. 

Interestingly, they only scored under 100 points twice during this 15 game stretch, and both times were against the Phoenix Suns, back to back on Feb 24th and 25th. They scored 97 and 99, and won both games. 

I think when people who weren’t able to watch Magic play (like myself) see his numbers and how stacked teams were, we tend to not fully understand how good he was. He was clearly a basketball savant who is one of those players that impacted winning and rarely, if ever, had a time where he was putting up empty stats. If Magic was on that night, which was often, the Lakers were absolutely unstoppable. 

The Lakers went on to be the 1st seed in the West, and defeated the Boston Celtics in 6 games to win the NBA Championship. 

Magic won Finals MVP averaging 26-13-8 and 2.3 steals on 54% from the field, capping off possibly the best season we have ever seen out of a point guard.

Just want to give all the younger people like myself some frame of reference when they’re quick to put anyone in the same tier as Magic, he is in a league of his own!",0.87,hot,7/23/20 17:36

523,"How to make the ""draft lottery"" process better",0,hwzifr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwzifr/how_to_make_the_draft_lottery_process_better/,42,1595615972,"Hi guys,  this is my first post so apologies if there are formatting issues.  

I haven't looked through previous posts on this so apologies if someone else has voiced this.

What we do first, is remove the draft lottery process altogether, and replace it with a play in tournament for the top 4 draft picks.  This tournament can run in line with the NBA playoffs but it doesn't have to, if it's deemed to be too much basketball. For those picks that are 5 to 14 (lottery picks) these are then determined based on your NBA record.

The traditionally projected top two teams get a bye into the second round in order to make the bracket fill out.  If there is an expansion of 2 teams into the league you may wish to give the 2 teams, the top 2 picks going into the next 2 or 3 seasons and then following the introductory period to the league, the new teams would be required to enter the now 16 team bracket.  During the introductory period the 2 new teams would play each other for the first overall pick, in a best of three series

What this always for is the league expansion teams giving opportunities to Gleague, free agency, street ball players, to show their skills and potentially get semi pro/professional minutes.

The brackets would be organised in such a way that the teams with the lesser NBA record would have top seeds and they would play the team that would traditionally be expected to have the last pick in the lottery.  The brackets are not sorted by conference but by NBA ranking.

Obviously, this would lead to many expecting the 14th ranked team (the best of the teams to not make the NBA playoffs) so to remove this, we take the point difference  between starting fives during the season as a points handicap per game.  Each series is a best of 5 series with the final being best of 7 series.

It works in the trade market although I do need some ideas to make this better.  I will acknowledge that this is a little convoluted  but hear me out.

This could be introduced during the next CBA or if you're wanting to start on an even playing field, introduce it when the currently traded draft picks are finally selected.

Examples

If the 2nd seed pick belonging to  team A in the tournament is traded to team B that is also in the tournament,  then team B gains the 2nd seed along with their own pick seed.   

If the 2nd seed pick belonging to team A in the tournament is traded to team C  that has made the NBA playoffs, then team C enters the draft pick tournament (as the 14th pick, measured by NBA record if there are multiple team C in that years draft selection).  Team C also remain in the NBA playoffs.   Because Team C are in two tournaments they must nominate a squad for playoffs and another for the tournament.   Those in the playoff squad can only play in the draft pick tournament if they haven't played a professional game in 2 weeks due to injury.    Those who were nominated as the draft pick tournament squad would be permitted to play in the nba playoff tournament if there is an injury to a playoff played

In this circumstance, Team C can now allow for opportunities for gleague players, free agency players, street ballers, the opportunity to try to gain contracts by having the draft pic tournament on TV.

It also gives Assistant coaches the opportunity to act as Head coaches during the draft pick tournament, if both tournaments are at the same time.",0.47,hot,7/24/20 11:39
524,Players who can have their Jersey Retired on 3 Different Teams,29,hwiv8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwiv8y/players_who_can_have_their_jersey_retired_on_3/,59,1595550891,"The only player to get their jersey retired on three teams was Wilt Chamberlein. This shows how much free agency has changed throughout NBA history and how players are in search of a better situation at that moment and more prone to leave. All of these players are entering/still in/just leaving their prime

3. Kawhi Leonard

I have Kawhi higher on this list simply because we don’t know if Toronto, and possibly San Antonio, will retire his jersey. In San Antonio he did create a big fuss and demanded a trade: He was there for only a handful of years and set the franchise back when he left. However, he did win a Championship and DPOY twice with them. I personally believe he has done enough to get his jersey retired there, but there still may be some unknown tension between him and the franchise. Toronto is also somewhat iffy since he came in, won, then dipped. This was their first championship ever though, and it wouldn't have been possible without him, so I think there should be a decent chance Toronto retires his jersey. If Kawhi does win a chip as a Clipper, and possibly shows commitment by signing for and extended deal, I think he has a good chance of having his jersey retired by the Clippers too.

2. Kevin Durant:

Kevin Durant is already a lock for OKC, even if most OKC fans still hate him. 4 scoring titles and a championship run should be enough. Especially after 9 seasons with the franchise and being close to the player to play for OKC right next to Westbrook, KD deserves to have his jersey retired by OKC. I understand he didn't leave OKC on the best of terms, but just by how long he was there and how he gave the franchise some of its best seasons it has ever had he should be considered. Additionally, he did fulfill his contract and didn't force a trade that would have resulted in OKC probably getting a worse player than him. Golden state had already announced they are going to retire his jersey after his achilles tear. Now if KD can recover to at least 70% of what he once was he’ll make noise. The east is strong, but the Nets could have a good chance of making the finals if they perhaps add another piece. If KD were to win a championship or even have a fair amount of strong seasons with the team (more than 4 seasons), that drastically would increase his chances of getting his jersey retired by the Nets.

1. LeBron James

LeBron had some of his best prime years with the Heat. He won 2 MVPS and 2 FMVPS with them. He was a crucial part in them winning, and will probably have his jersey retired there. For the Lakers, LeBron will have to win a championship or at least pick up an MVP. The Lakers have elite company among those who have had their jersey retired by the team. I feel like it should be very possible for LeBron to have his jersey retired by the Lakers simply, because we know the Lakers (assuming AD resigns) are and will be strong contenders for a couple years, and during that time I could easily see LeBron win a championship

Lastly, for Cleveland it’s up in the air. Sure LeBron had a couple good years there and won a championship, but I think he may be overshadowed by the legacy of Matthew Dellavadova. Delly was superior LeBron in almost every facet of the game during LeBron's second tenure in Clevland. I think LeBron has an okay chance of getting his number retired by the Cavs, but only if the media can shift their view from true greatness to LeBron",0.85,hot,7/23/20 17:34
525,What's Next For The Atlanta Hawks? Part 3: Free Agency [OC],30,hwhwal,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwhwal/whats_next_for_the_atlanta_hawks_part_3_free/,11,1595547790,"This upcoming offseason the Atlanta Hawks are in a prime position to make a major acquisition through free agency. Their 48.4 million dollars in cap space is the most in the league and puts the Hawks in an interesting predicament. Do they want to commit big money to a high-end free agent or would they rather spend their money on role players on short term contracts? Today we will be looking at free agents that the Hawks should be looking to target in this upcoming offseason. We will separate these free agents into separate tiers (low-tier, mid-tier, and high-tier) based upon the predicted impact of said free agent. Without further adieu, let’s talk some Hawks.

Low-Tier Free Agents:

Micheal Kidd-Gilchrist:

MKG just had the worst season of his underwhelming career this last season. He struggled to stay on the court and even when healthy he had a hard time finding himself minutes on a middling Hornets team and a surging Maverick squad. MKG has offered little on offense in his career but the one thing he has always been solid at is defending. MKG could bring some much-needed perimeter and interior defense to this Hawks squad that ranked 26th in defensive rating this past year. MKG, in limited minutes, could bolster the Hawks defense as he could effectively defend opposing wings on the perimeter and offer a solid defensive presence on the interior. Now he’s not going to be doing much on the offensive end but the Hawks wouldn’t really need him to. MKG would serve as a rim roller and lob threat, no more. He could also set some screens and grab some boards but his offense is very limited. Let’s not even talk about that fugly jump shot (like seriously ew, that shit nasty). The Hawks could probably get MKG on a minimum contract considering he didn’t exactly torch the league this past season, putting up whopping averages of 2.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 0.6 assists. On a minimum contract, it’s a very low-risk deal and in my opinion, it’s a risk worth taking.

Torrey Craig:

Over the last two seasons, Torrey Craig has been a piece of some very strong defensive in Denver. He’s shown to be a very strong perimeter defender, occasionally locking down the opposing team's twos and threes and, at very least, making their life a bit more difficult. He’s the type of player to bring energy to the defense off the bench and make winning plays on that end. His 6’7 frame limits what he can do defensively against big men, but he does a good job of closing down passing lanes and providing help defense on the interior.

Craig’s no phenom on offense but he’s not an absolute zero. His shooting is a bit underwhelming, but he can definitely hit an open three (33% from three this season). He’s athletic enough to get to the basket on occasion, where he shoots a very respectable 71.4%. He is ineffective from the midrange, but luckily for his team, he’s not one to launch up a ton of dumb shots. His playmaking is underwhelming at best, however, he will not kill his team with a barrage of turnovers. Ultimately Craig is a smart, hardworking, hustler that could provide a quality defense and shooting on the court while also acting as a leader in the locker room. Craig is a restricted free agent this summer so the Hawks would need to be willing to outbid the Nuggets. I think the Hawks could get Craig at something like a two-year, 12-13 million dollar deal. If they can get him in that price range, I'd like to see Craig on the Hawks. 

Nerlens Noel:

If the Hawks are looking to upgrade at the backup five-position Nerlens Noel might just be their guy. Nerlens has had an up and down career up to this point but he seems to have finally found his footing in OKC. This season, Noel put up a mega efficient 7.7 point, 4.9 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1.5 blocks in just 18.4 minutes a game. On offense, Noel is your typical rim roller. He runs the pick and roll, finishes at the basket, and occasionally catches lobs. Noel is a serviceable post player, whipping out a fade away or hook shot every now and then. Over the years Noel has expanded his game to the midrange where he’s been semi-effective (shooting 33.3% between 15-19ft). Noel isn’t a playmaker but he is a smart passer. He’s good at getting the ball to players who then carry out a play. He does turn over the ball a bit more than you’d like but it’s not a serious problem. Let’s move on to his bread and butter, his defense.

Defense has been the one constant thing Noel has had going for him in his NBA career. He’s always been a good interior defender who’s more than capable of swatting shots right back at where they came from. Noel’s got the body to be a great NBA defender as he’s 6’10 and 220lbs however it’s his defensive IQ that really makes him what he is on defense. Noel is a great help defender, always covering his teammate's weak side and being in the position to contest shots. He’s an adept reader of passing lanes and is always ready to pounce on a misplaced place, it shows in his stats as well as he grabs a steal in just over 18 minutes a game. His perimeter defense is suspect, but at the center position, that is less essential. Noel is a strong rebounder, notching 4.9 rebounds a game, and an impressive 1.5 offensive rebounds a game for the Thunder. Out of all the cheaper options, Nerlens is probably my favorite for the Hawks. He’d be a very nice defensive piece off the bench, acting as a sort of unconventional sixth man. Noel could thrive next to a passer like Trae Young and really grow along with this team as he’s still only 25 years old. Noel will probably be looking for a longer-term deal with more guaranteed money but if the Hawks are willing to pay up he could be a very nice piece for them. 

Avery Bradley:

I know what you’re thinking, would Bradley really leave the Lakers to play for this young, inexperienced Hawks team. If the paycheck was large enough I think he would. Bradley has been a very solid player for the Lakers and I'm sure they’d like to retain him but I believe that if the Hawks wanted him bad enough they could get him. Bradley has always been a high-level defender and he would certainly bring experience and leadership on that end for the Hawks. Due to his elite perimeter defense, Bradley would take on the hardest defensive assignment between the two guards and help hide Trae’s piss poor defense. He could also net the Hawks some more steals with his excellent off-ball defense, leading to more transition opportunities for the team.

On offense, Bradley would act mainly as a spot-up shooter (similar to what he’s doing in L.A.). Bradley’s been a strong shooter for most of his career, which is good because you can never have too much shooting. Bradley won’t be out their making pinpoint passes or breaking ankles but he doesn’t need to. He is the epitome of a 3&D player. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Middle Tier Free Agents:

Kris Dunn: 

Kris Dunn has become a pretty underrated player in today's game. His lack of scoring ability has made him go under the radar for all the other things he can do on the court for you. Dunn has made a name for himself on the defensive end where he’s legitimately an all-defensive level player. I know counting stats don’t really paint a good picture of how good a player is defensively but let's just take a look real quick. In just 24 minutes a game Dunn snagged himself two steals a game (nearly three steals a game per 36). That’s super impressive and really highlights Dunn’s ability to read passing lanes and use his athleticism to capitalize on misplaced passes. Dunn would provide what Bradley does on defense except it would be like Bradley on crack cocaine. Dunn is a superior athlete compared to Bradley and at this point in his career a better lockdown defender. Dunn could clamp down on both point guards and shooting guard while still holding his own against some of the smaller wings. Dunn would be a perfect fit defensively next to Trae. He could take on the harder defensive assignment between the two and even use his defensive IQ to back up Trae when he needs it. 

Offensively Dunn, as I stated, is a bit limited. He can finish at the basket as he’s shooting roughly 64% on shots within five feet of the basket. But other than that his shooting is pretty atrocious, especially for a guard. He shoots below average from pretty much everywhere else on the court. His midrange stats are pretty gross and his three-point shooting is no better. The good thing is that Dunn doesn’t force up a ton of shots he's not good at. For instance, he only shot two threes a game this season. Luckily Dunn is a damn good passer who’s definitely capable of acting as a secondary playmaker. Dunn constantly makes smart passes, getting the ball to open shooters and cutters. He’s simply good at initiating the offense and getting the ball where it needs to go. In transition Dunn can be both a finisher and initiator, making well-aimed passes if he gets overwhelmed on his way to the basket. His fit next to Trae is excellent, he can help initiate the defense, allowing Trae to play off-ball while also covering for Trae’s lack of defense. When you take into account his age (25) it becomes even more clear how seamless a fit Dunn would be on the Hawks.

Paul Millsap:

How about a reunion! Millsap spent four excellent years in Atlanta where he made a name for himself by being a gritty defender and leader. Millsap has been a winning player his whole career and at the age of 34, that is yet to change. He’d bring some much-needed experience to the locker room. Millsap could really help the Hawks on defense where he would bolster their interior defense tremendously. Millsap would be able to use his size, strength, and length to keep the opposition from reaching the basket. His help defense would also pay major dividends for the Hawks as he could help make up for some of Capela’s and Collin’s shortcomings on that end. Millsap is also a useful perimeter defender as he’s quick enough to keep up with a majority of wings despite being on the older side. More than anything Millsap would give the Hawks defense a leader and a consistent defensive presence. He could help teach some of the young Hawks to learn defense and show bigs like Collins how to better perceive the game on that end of the floor. 

Millsap would also act as a solid offensive edition to the Hawks. Over the last seven years, Millsap has developed a pretty reliable jump shot. This development of his jumper has really shown out this last season where he shot a career-high three-point percentage (44%) on 2.5 threes a game. In fact, 25.6% of his shots came from catch and shoot situations from three. He’s also become quite proficient at making shots from the midrange, especially fadeaways. This season Millsap shot an impressive 50% from between 10-14ft away from the basket. At the basket, Millsap is a proficient finisher and low post player. Millsap uses his hulk-like strength to back down defenders and push past said defenders for put backs. He’s also quite a skilled post player, using a wide range of fakes, fades, and hook shots to get buckets. He’s a pretty skilled rebounder, he’ll use his strength to outcompete the opposition for rebounders. He’s also good at positioning himself for rebounds and boxing out players for the rebound. Playmaking isn’t really Millsaps thing. He’s not a bad passer, just a bad playmaker. He makes good decisions with the ball but he often misses open teammates due to a simple lack of vision. It’s all good though if you were the Hawks you really wouldn’t want the ball to be taken out of Trae’s hands anyway. Millsap would be an awesome addition to the Hawks, however, it might be tricky finding him enough playing time considering he’d have to split time with John Collins. But if they could make it work Millsap would definitely help the Hawks win more games. It’s just whether or not they’d be willing to play Millsap over some of their young players (mainly John Collins). Getting Millsap would be the type of move that would really highlight the direction of the Hawks. Are they going all-in on making the Hawks good now or are they going to take it slow? I guess we will have to see. 

Derrick Favors: 

Don’t let the stats fool you. Derrick Favors is a very good player. Whereas some players make their mark on the offensive end Favors has always been a defender first. He’s an absolute force on the interior, making opposing ball handlers second guess their decision to visit the paint. He’s a more than capable shot blocker, notching 1.3 blocks a game for his career. He’s not the type to be back down by other bigs either as he’s built like a fucking bulldozer (like holy fuck bud). He makes life hard for the opposition in the interior but how does he fare on the perimeter? Not great, he’s a bit slow on his feet so keeping up with guards and quicker wings is a bit of a problem for Favors. He’s better suited staying in the paint where he has less ground to traverse and he can focus on bodying everybody. Favors is also a great rebounder. This past season he grabbed 9.9 rebounds and 3.3 offensive boards. This was in large part because of his elite positioning as well as his ability slither around box-outs to get to the ball. 

Favors is mainly an interior scorer. He’s very reminiscent of the bigs of the NBA's past, using a variety of post moves to finesse his way to points. He also uses his size to his advantage finishing through heavy contests/contact. Said size is also used to push around defenders in the post, putting Favors in prime position for a dunk or put back. He’s also a quality roller to the basket, which would be great to have off the bench (assuming they don’t start him over Collins or Capela). Favors rarely shoot threes, however, he’s not opposed to shooting the occasional mid-range shot. He’s shown to be a decent shooter from within 14ft so there's that. But overall he’s a subpar shooter. Favors helps his teammates by setting hard screens, allowing his teammates to make plays, and get shots off. I’d love to see Favors on the Hawks. He’s the type of selfless, defensive anchor the Hawks need to take a step forward. Back in Utah, he came off the bench for multiple years with little fuss, which is a great sign that he would probably not start for the Hawks. Rather he would act as a sort of defensive based sixth man. In my opinion, the Hawks should favor Favors in free agency (god that was a shitty pun).

High Tier Free Agents:

Otto Porter:

The last two seasons haven’t been the kindest to Otto Porter. He went from being stuck in a reportedly toxic locker room in Washington and then was shipped to Chicago to play on the bottom-feeding Bulls. This last season Porter really struggled to stay healthy, leading to limited success on the court. When healthy Porter has been a very solid player, putting up 14.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2 assists on 50/44/83 shooting splits. He was a damn good offensive player, well suited to play as a third option. Porter is already a good shooter but he could really be optimized playing next to a transcendent player like Trae Young. He could spot in the corner for more threes. Porter would also benefit from being next to Trae as he would get more opportunities to act as the roll man in the pick and roll, where Otto has been quite effective (66.5% shooting within five feet of the basket in his last full season in Washington). Porter would add another shot creator to the Hawks lineup as he’s more than willing and capable of shooting from the midrange (55% 2017-2018 season) and from deep (44.1% on 4.1 threes a game). Porter uses his lateral quickness to dash by defenders and cut to the basket. He’s also become pretty solid at creating his own shot from outside, using fakes and hesitations to throw off the defenders timing and get the shot off. Despite Otto only averaging 1.5 assists for his career I’d argue that he’s actually a pretty effective passer. He’s shown to be an effective passer in the pick and roll, swiftly identifying the open cutter and nail him (pause) with a bullseye pass. In transition Otto is nothing special, he’s more than capable of finishing at the basket but he doesn’t have the Fox-like speed to be a premier threat in the full court. 

Defensively Porter is pretty solid. He’s not going to be getting an all-defensive team selection anytime soon but he’s no slouch either. Porter is quick on his feet, which allows him to keep up with a vast array of wings on the perimeter. He’s really effective at staying in front of his man and contesting shots at the basket. His interior defense is limited due to his lack of size and strength but he’s not a complete pushover. He’s long enough to make guards live hard at the basket but has a hard time not getting overpowered by big men. Porter would add another layer to both the Hawks defense and offense. He’d thrive as the third-option next to Young and Collins, getting plenty of open looks from three, the midrange, and at the basket. If Porter can stay healthy and go back to being the player he was back in the 2017-2018 season, he could be quite the pickup for the Hawks.

Bogdan Bogdanovic: 

Bogdan is coming off a career year in which he took the starting spot away from sharpshooter Buddy Hield. Bogdan was simply a more versatile player than Heild, both as a defender and scorer. He can score from anywhere on the court, making his own offense with finesse and skill. He shot 43.3% from the field, 36.1% from three on 7.2 attempts a game, and a career-low 72.4% from the line this last season (which is an outlier for his career). So yeah… he’s a damn good shooter. His playmaking is also pretty strong. He didn’t get to flash it a ton this season since Fox was deservingly the lead ball-handler and playmaker for the Kings but Bogdan is more than capable of leading an offense. He makes smart passes, finding open cutters and shooters. He’s the type of player that doesn’t make a ton of stupid decisions with the ball, which is valuable in itself. He’d also be a nice transition threat for the Hawks, both as a passer or finisher. His biggest contribution to the Hawks would lie in his shot creation ability as he’s quick enough and skilled enough as a ball-handler to get and make shots on his own. On offense, Bogdan would be a seamless fit next to the team's other young players.

Now onto the defense. Bogdan is by no means a terrible defender. He’s a decent perimeter defender who uses his quickness to stay in front of opposing guards. He’s not a very active off-ball defender however, he lacks spatial awareness at times. He’s not a particularly great help defender either since he sometimes struggles to read the floor. Like most guards, his defense on the interior is lacking. He can guard other guards but the second you put a big man on him in the post he’s fried chicken. He just simply isn’t big enough or strong enough to hang with 4’s and 5’s of the NBA. He is okay to slightly above average defender overall but if you're acquiring him you're doing it for what he brings on the offensive side of the ball. His fit on the Hawks is a bit more questionable than some of the other players we have listed as you’d ideally want an elite defender next to Trae at the other guard position but his offensive fit could be seamless. He could take up secondary ball-handling and playmaking opportunities, allowing Trea to play off-ball more. He could also lead the second unit at the point when Trae is sitting on the bench. That way they would always have a high-level playmaker in the game. It would certainly be a win-now move to pay big money for Bogdan. But if the Hawks are focused on winning now they should be prepared to pay a king's ransom as it will be hard to pry him away from Sacramento. 

Danilo Gallinari:

This would be the Hawks going all-in on offense. Gallo’s a straight-up bucket and he’d definitely bring some more shot creation to the lineup. His ability to hit from anywhere on the court would alleviate some of the scoring burden off of Trae shoulders and allow him to focus a bit more on facilitating the ball. Gallo would give them another player to give the ball in crunch time as he’s more than capable of making his own shot. He’s more than capable of getting you a bucket in the post as well, which could allow Collins to get more spot-up attempts from outside. Gallo wouldn’t fill the team's need for a secondary playmaker but his scoring would be more than enough to make up for it. Plus you don’t really want to take the ball out of Trae's hands unless you have to. 

Gallo’s a notably shaky defender compared to others on this list. He can provide serviceable defense on the interior, where he uses his length to block off areas and contest shots. Unfortunately, Gallo is pretty shitty as a perimeter defender. His lack of athleticism leads to players being able to blow by him with relative ease. I mean he’s not a traffic cone on that end of the floor. He has some ability to read the offense and position himself, but the overall defense just isn’t his forte. Of all the players we’ve spoken of so far, Gallo might just be the best out of all of them. He also might be the worst fit for the Hawks. True, his shot creation would alleviate the scoring burden that both Trae and Collins take on but his defense would undoubtedly hurt the team. You would be adding a subpar defender to one of the worst defenses in the league...no thanks. His age would also be an issue as he’s 31 years old. Gallo is a very good player, but I don’t think he’s the right player to put next to this young, burgeoning core.

Gordon Hayward:

Hayward doesn’t get enough love. After a gruesome leg injury a few years back many people wondered if he’d ever be the same player he once was. He’s yet to reach the highs that he did back in Utah but he’s still managed to be a high-impact player despite his setbacks. This year as the fourth option on a supremely talented Celtics team Hayward put up an impressive 17.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4 assists on all-around efficient shooting. That was as a fourth option! Sure Hayward may never be quite the same as he was in Utah but he’s still a really fucking good player. The stats back it up too, this season the Celtics net rating was +6.2 with Hayward playing. He’s another one of those all-around scorers, able to drive to the basket, hit from midrange, and snipe from deep. This shooting mixed with his high-level ball-handling skills make him a threat at all times as he could just as easily cut to the basket as he could pull up from deep. He could also take on that secondary playmaking role we’ve been talking about as Gordon is an above-average facilitator. He’s especially good at finding cutters to the basket and working as a passer in the pick and roll. Skills that would very much so come in handy next to Collins and Capela. 

How’s the defensive fit next to the rest of the Hawks? Well, Hayward is just alright on defense. His perimeter defense is solid, he can keep up with most wings. If he lets a ball-handler slip by him Hayward has the burst to chase his man down and still get up to contest the shot. His man to man defense is strong but his off-ball defense could use some work. He can be inconsistent on that end, which is problematic as Atlanta needs a consistent defensive presence, someone they can really rely on. His interior defense, as a whole, is underwhelming. He’s not as tall or heavy as some other wings, leading him to getting bodied in the post more often than not. Despite some of his defensive flaws I like the idea of the Hawks picking up Gordon Hayward (assuming he doesn’t pick up his player option). He’d slide right into the Hawks lineup as a shot creator and playmaker while not hurting them on defense. His game would add another dimension to the Hawks offense, a dimension that might just get the Hawks to the playoffs.

Side Note: I didn’t include Brandon Ingram on the list because I don’t see any way the Pelicans don’t match any offer that is given to him.

527,[OC] Jamal Murray Has Time on His Side,50,hwduhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwduhu/oc_jamal_murray_has_time_on_his_side/,14,1595531719,"With every fresh bout of inconsistent play, it feels like a few more people give up on the idea of Jamal Murray ever being the perennial All-Star many pegged him to be after his first season with Denver Nuggets. And to be fair, as the 2019-20 season stumbles into (maybe) the post-season, Murray is yet to feature – or even warrant much consideration – for that particular honour. However, those outside the Nuggets fanbase (who are kind of obligated to believe in Murray considering the 5yr/$170 Million contract the organisation signed him to) shouldn’t dump all their stock just yet. 

As has already been detailed by many, Murray can be an incredibly frustrating player to watch. On the one hand, there are games like the one he had himself against Memphis early in the season, where he posted a 39/8/4 stat line to go along with 3 steals, 7 made 3-pointers (on 12 3PA), and a +23 NetRtg. And then on the other, there are games like the one he had against Golden State just before the league-wide shut down, where he posted a 14/3/6 line while shooting 3/14 from the field and 0/6 from 3. And although every player goes through highs and lows – especially when said players are high-volume shooters who play the point – few are as volatile while Murray and less warrant his level of interest from the national media. 

All that being said, Murray is still young, and inconsistency comes with the territory. And all one has to do to remind themselves (and others) of just how much room a player like Murray has to grow is to study the past seasons of similar, yet more-established point guards. 

Below is a per game and advanced stats comparison of Murray and 4 guards that fit the above mould:

Player A (22yrs/4th season): 36.4 MP, 21.7 PTS, 5.2 AST, 1.5 STL, 1.9 TOV on 47/42/85 splits

Player B (22yrs/1st season): 38.6 MP, 19.0 PTS, 6.5 AST, 0.9 STL, 2.1 TOV on 43/37/84 splits

Player C (22yrs/2nd season): 33.6 MP, 18.6 PTS, 5.8 AST, 1.5 STL, 3.1 TOV on 48/44/93 splits 

Player D (22yrs/4th season): 32.8 MP, 18.8 PTS, 4.8 AST, 1.2 STL, 2.3 TOV on 46/35/89 splits

Player E (22yrs/2nd season): 34.9 MP, 17.7 PTS, 5.7 AST, 2.0 STL, 2.4 TOV on 42/32/80 splits

Per:

1. Player A
2. Player C
3. Player E
4. Player D
5. Player B

WS/48

1. Player A
2. Player C
3. Player D

3. Player E
4. Player D
5. Player B

VORP:

1. Player A
2. Player C
3. Player E
4. Player B
5. Player D

	Of the above: one is a two-time MVP, another played his age-22 season alongside perhaps the greatest player in history, and two others are both multi-time All-Stars each with at least one All-NBA nod. The other: Jamal Murray. 

Now, none of this to say that Jamal Murray will ever win an MVP award, make an All-NBA team, or even make an All-Star appearance (although for the record my money would be on no, yes, and multiple respectively). But rather, this post should serve only as a reminder that Murray (and other young players like him) should always be discussed in the proper context. Murray is young. He’s relatively inexperienced. He plays the hardest spot on the floor to master. **And he is the only point guard in the NBA who has to defer primary playmaking responsibilities to a seven-footer**. 

Sure, Murray is not the player we want him to be right now, but does that mean he’ll never be? Only time will tell. 

For reference:

Player A: Kyrie Irving
Player B: Stephen Curry
Player C: Damian Lillard
Player D: Jamal Murray
Player E: Kemba Walker",0.89,hot,7/23/20 12:15

Looking at Luka's holistic performance over the season I'd say he's overrated.

* Already has a supporting cast many stars in bad situations would dream of. So many shooters and lob catchers. Perfectly suited for both the modern NBA and Luka's game. 

* Mavericks do well without him in comparison to other superstars who drive their offense.

* I don't think he'll become a good shooter like many are expecting. His FT% (75%) is average. He shoots 32% on threes because he attempts Harden-level difficulty shots without Harden-level shooting. 

* Wasn't clutch this year due to aforementioned three bricking in crunch time. But he was clutch in his rookie year so who knows. 

* Stat stuffing is due to high usage and almost always handling the ball + initiating plays when on the floor. 

**The case for underrated**

This boils down to one thing: he might not have been healthy. 

* He started off the season AMAZING. Leading the league in WS/48, BPM, VORP. 

* Apparently he sustained injuries at some point? And was playing through them. While still good, his numbers dropped. 

* So, Luka might lowkey be the best player in the league already who could average an efficient 30 point trible double when completely healthy. 

**The case for properly rated**

He's usually rated 5th among healthy players this season. Honestly I don't really have a case that he should be exactly here. I think he should either be closer to first, or rated lower with players like AD, Jokic, Dame, Embiid ahead of him. What do you think?",0.65,hot,7/23/20 18:23

Caruso was prepared to pay for private flights from Orlando to Austin and back, he said. He would leave after the Lakers' practice on July 17 -- the day before the wedding. He contemplated attending the ceremony, which was outdoors, and skipping the indoor reception. He looked into finding a ""safe house"" in the Austin area where he might be able to sleep after leaving the ceremony, but finding one on short notice proved impossible.

Last Thursday, two days before the wedding, he made his decision and texted his family: he would skip it. He had friends record ""basically the whole event"" and send him video, he said. Caruso spent his downtime over the weekend watching the footage in his room.

""There were some people that should have had masks on that didn't,"" Caruso said of the wedding. ""I would say 75% of the people had them on. Texas and Florida -- they can kind of be their own countries at times. Some people just like to do their own thing.""

He could not FaceTime into the wedding live because the reception was not good enough, he said. Caruso is sad, but at peace with his choice.

Some comments proposed setting a minutes limit, while others proposed not being allowed to be in the top 5 in minutes played per game on their own team.

Montrezl would also have won under this method. Lou Will would be a 3-time winner. Bobby Jackson, Eddie Johnson, John Drew, Leandro Barbosa and Ricky Pierce would all be two-time winners.

541,Most MVP votes for players who never won MVP in the last 20 years,266,hvxfs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvxfs6/most_mvp_votes_for_players_who_never_won_mvp_in/,130,1595465863,"Looking back, there were so many great players who never won MVP. Even many who were so close to winning the MVP, or those that were just ""in the conversation"" a lot, but never got close.

So i devised a very simple formula to see who these people were. 

* Take the voting for players who have never won an MVP
* Divide by the maximum votes (since the scoring system fluctuates year to year) that year to devise a ""Almost-MVP score""
* Add it all up; simple as that, to get their ""Total Almost-MVP Score""

Do note that because I only went up to the last 20 years (could go further if I had time), some players who crossed the 90's into the 2000's were likely misrepresented just a little in the data in terms of how they impacted MVP races. Most notably Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Reggie miller etc.

I won't post the detailed year-by-year results in this thread, but you can find everything [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtarP_npuCJqAxK-j43167yazK-8TMB1AXWlF4RrRRE/edit?usp=sharing).

Onto the top 20:

|Player|Total Almost-MVP Score|
|:-|:-|
|1. Chris Paul|163.9|
|2. Dwight Howard|124.9|
|3. Kawhi Leonard|99.2|
|4. Tracy McGrady|85.5|
|5. Dwyane Wade|79.3|
|6. Jason Kidd|78.7|
|7. Anthony Davis|59.9|
|8. Chris Webber|54.5|
|9. Carmelo Anthony|45.3|
|10. Jermaine O'Neal|42.5|

Some observations about the top 10:

* This methodology generally skews towards one of two groups; people who were top 3 MVP voting in close races, or people who received MVP voting a lot. 
* Chris Paul is one of the rare cases where its both. In 14 seasons he received MVP voting in a whopping 8 different years (tied first with Wade), and will undoubtedly get some points this year as well. That combined with a 2nd place finish in 08, 3rd in 2012 and 4th in 2013 puts him deservedly at the top of the list
* Dwight was definitely the one that burned the brightest, only receiving votes in 5 years, but in those 5 years he was top 5 voting in 4, including a 2nd place finish
* Similarly, Kawhi only received votes in 4 years, but has a 2nd and 3rd place finish; lets assume in a few years he probably gets a lot more.
* McGrady also had 2 strong finishes, though I must say got a ton of votes even on those mediocre Magic teams
* Kidd is mostly on the list due to his 2nd place finish against Tim Duncan, though since we aren't including the 90's he likely has much more
* Wade only had 1 big vote year, though got votes in 8 seasons.
* AD, Melo, Webber and Jermaine Oneal make the top 10 due to one high finish. 

Stray Observations

* A total of 73 players who have never won MVP have received at least 1 MVP vote in the last 20 years
* Of those, 17 players have received exactly one 5th place MVP vote. They are (from most recent) Klay Thompson, Mike Conley, Ty Lawson, David Lee, Stephen Jackson, Antawn Jamison, Rasheed Wallace, PJ Brown, Marcus Camby, Michael Redd, Jamal Mashburn, Mike Bibby, Anthony Mason, John Stockton, Darrell Armstrong, Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose (the last 2 in the same year while both on the Pacers).
* Marcus Camby, PJ Brown and Darrell Armstrong all received a vote despite never having made an all-star team. Though each had their own hardware (and were better than Jamal Mashburn)
* In addition to those 17, 11 players also received votes only once: Andrei Kirilenko, Sam Cassell, Brandon Roy, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, John Wall, Isaiah Thomas, Victor Oladipo and Jimmy Butler
* Of the players who only received votes once, Isaiah Thomas has far and away the most points (8) with a fifth place finish. 
* Of the players who only received votes twice, Paul George and Joakim Noah are way ahead of everyone else.
* Tony Parker got votes in 7 years, but finished outside the top 5 in voting in 6 of those years
* Players most likely to move way up on this list in a decades time (if they don't win an MVP) will be Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic
* The most votes without ever receiving a top 5 finish in multiple years are Paul Pierce (4.1 in 5 years), Amare Stoudemire (6.3 in 4 years), Ben Wallace, (6.63 in 3 years), Vince Carter (5 in 3 years) and Lamarcus Aldridge (3.1 in 3 years)
* Yao Ming, Michael Finley and Joe Johnson share the distinction of only ever receiving a single 5th place vote in multiple years. 

**TL;DR -** Of players who never won an MVP in the last 20 years, Chris Paul and Dwight got the most votes. There's other stuff too. Thanks for reading.",0.98,hot,7/22/20 17:57
542,"[OC] Ahead of the re-start, lets look at where every team likes to shoot from (relative to league average)",336,hvv6ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvv6ua/oc_ahead_of_the_restart_lets_look_at_where_every/,99,1595458471,"tl;dr: [This chart shows how often each team shoots from the various parts of the court relative to league average. Darker areas indicate a higher amount of attempts from the corresponding area relative to the rest of the league.](https://imgur.com/UPAarqF)

***

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/UPAarqF), I show how often each team shoots from the different parts of the court, relative to league average. Darker areas on the court indicate a higher amount of volume from the corresponding area compared to the rest of the league. 

For example, take a look at the patch of dark red +30 feet from the hoop on the Atlanta Hawks chart. That means the Hawks (read: Trae Young) take more shots from that part of the court than any other team. 

Meanwhile, the Spurs have a blanket of black in the mid-range. Accordingly, they take more mid-range shots per game than anyone else (the next closest is Indiana).  

It's pretty easy to pick out certain players impact on their teams' shot selection 

* Melo's antiquated shot selection in Portland 
* CP3's signature elbow jumper 
* The pick and pop game of Brogdon and Sabonis in Indiana 
* AD's baseline jumper game in LA
* PJ Tucker and the rest of the Houston Rocket Corner Threes 

Note that blank areas show where a team shoots at or below league average volume. For example, the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets have almost no color in the mid-range because they take at or less than the league average number of attempts from that part of the court. A team like the Celtics takes roughly a league average number of attempts from almost all parts of the court, which is why their whole chart is mostly blank. 

*** 

**Methodology:**

I charted every shot taken this season (2019-20) and binned them into similarly sized hexagons. I then found out the league average number of attempts from each hexagon and calculated how many standard deviations away from the mean each team was from each hexagon. The darker the color on the chart, the higher the deviation. A team taking a league-average number of attempts from each location would have a blank chart.

2006 he has no argument. His team wins 54 games (I don't care about injuries because that has never helped other MVP candidates before when they also had to deal with injured teammates) which is 4th best in the league and 3rd in the West. So he doesn't even fall within the conventional ""top 2 seed"" that most MVPs are.

Is anyone really going to argue he was better than Lebron, Kobe, Dirk, Chauncey Billups or Dwayne Wade that season?

Dirk who led a 60 win team and Billups who led a 64 win team have the best arguments strictly because of record. So what the hell were the voters thinking?",0.27,hot,7/24/20 15:38
545,Recreating the 2009 WCF Denver Nuggets team,42,hw5k60,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw5k60/recreating_the_2009_wcf_denver_nuggets_team/,38,1595492341,"I've seen some other recreations for the '04 Pistons, etc. but wanted to try my hand at one of my favorite teams of all time, the 2009 Denver Nuggets who reached the Western Conference Finals that season. Here goes:

STARTERS

PG: Chauncey Billups = **Kyle Lowry**. Two highly durable floor generals who can run an efficient offense, hit their shots, and operate with a pass-first mentality. Lowry is a bit more active on the boards, but their offensive game is extremely similar.

SG: Dahntay Jones = **Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot**. Jones was probably the weakest SGs the Nuggets have started over the last decade+, but was able to fill the starting lineup while J.R. Smith came off the bench. Jones was a bit more of a facilitator, but neither he nor Luwawu-Cabarrot were really asked to do much other than stand around with their hands open.

SF: Carmelo Anthony = **Pascal Siakam**. Both reliable offensive juggernauts and skilled No.1 options. Siakam is naturally more of a big, but Melo was beginning to rely more on his size at that point in his career and even showed flashes of his defensive capabilities (though there's really no comparison with Siakam's). Still, they're both elite scorers and strong rebounders, and while it's hard to make comparisons to players of Melo's caliber, I see a lot of similarities when I watch Siakam's one-on-one game (especially with the added mobility and range this year). Overall, the Lowry/Siakam combo reminds me a lot of Billups/Melo, and I think it works. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5\_2WDJe0Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5_2WDJe0Lo)

PF: Kenyon Martin = **Thaddeus Young.** Both 31-years old and declining, but still valuable on the defensive end. Kenyon Martin was great at getting into passing lanes and earning fast break opportunities similar to Young. K-Mart was more of a blocker in his day, but both players are good at cleaning up the glass and fulfilling their role.

C: Nenê = **Jaxson Hayes.** Sometimes overlooked by defenses, but about as solid offensively as you can get. Jaxson is much more mobile, but is also 7 years younger than '09 Nenê, and I could see him growing into that type of player as he adds more mass and experience (perhaps with a few more modern touches). Hayes is already a strong rebounder despite his lean frame and has shown flashes of Nenê's defensive versatility that will only improve as he learns to avoid fouls.

BENCH

J.R. Smith = **Bogdan Bogdanović**. Two deadly 3-pt snipers despite some streakiness. Bogdanović fills the same psuedo-6th man role on the Kings that J.R. filled on the '09 Nuggets, but when either one gets hot, they can take over the game. J.R. was a more aggressive offensive player, but both are decent facilitators as well.

Anthony Carter = **Rajon Rondo.** As above, both are 33-years old and are still valuable distributors and pass disruptors, but are often more liability than asset. Rondo seems to have lost some interest defensively (perhaps due to injuries), but you could do worse.

Linas Kleiza = **Jeff Green.** Green is already nearly a decade older than Kleiza was at this point, but their career trajectories meet pretty well in the middle. Green is really more of a defensive-minded 4 than Kleiza (who primarily played the 3), but both were decent catch-and-shoot options.

Chris Andersen = **JaVale McGee.** JaVale is probably the closest we have to Birdman in terms of monster blockers with generally underwhelming skillsets otherwise. McGee is more involved in the offensive scheme though, so he's not quite as strictly the defensive role player as Andersen was.

Renaldo Balkman = **Taj Gibson.** Gibson is a shell of his former self while Balkman was always kinda trash. He was actually a bit more of a craftier defender than Gibson is now, but I'm sure playing defense on the Knicks is just demoralizing, so I give Taj a pass here.

Johan Petro = **Dewayne Dedmon.** We traded for Petro halfway through the season (actually giving OKC the pick that became Taj Gibson) but he never really saw the floor too much. If he'd had a bit more of an opportunity, he probably would've looked similar to Dedmon (he's improved since moving back to Atlanta, but I'm still not sold. Don't forget he's nearly 31, too). Petro was a legit 7-footer like Dedmon, so he was able to catch a few rebounds, but didn't quite have Dedmon's defensive capabilities to be able to stick around in the league.

Jason Hart = **Frank Mason III.** Garbage time point guards that once showed some flashes but probably won't make it far in the league. Hart was able to use his size to some success defensively and they were both decent hustlers, but you really don't want them on the floor for long periods of time. Luckily Mason was able to take advantage of a two-way with Milwaulkee.

Anyway, let me know what you think of these comparisons. Taking ages and minutes into account, I think it's a decent looking team on paper, but how far would you see them going? Better or worse than the real deal Nuggets?",0.82,hot,7/23/20 1:19

I'll leave my personal picks below and feel free to disagree.

Clippers: Its undoubtedly the Rockets, the Rockets stretch the floor out better than everyone and have been a matchup problem all year for the Clips. I think the Clips are really hard to beat on paper because this roster is unbelievable, but Houston's ability to score half their points on 3s is a terrifying thought, especially with their beefed perimeter defense against LACs stars

Bucks: I know their are Miami truthers, but I have to go Toronto. This team did it once and even though they don't have Kawhi, they have a new cutthroat star in Siakam. While Miami can stop Giannis, the goal of this series isn't to stop Giannis, it's to stop the Bucks and Miami just doesn't have the offensive firepower that Toronto does while still maintaining elite defense. The Raptors have an uphill battle to win this series but they have a punchers chance.

Lakers: I struggled most with this one because I think while the Lakers to me are the scariest team this year they also feel the most vulnerable. Since I already picked Houston I'll go with Denver. The Nuggets have size now, the only team in the West that can outsize the Lakers. I don't expect the Nuggets to run 3 centers but I think their height advantage and rim protection may be enough to slow AD and force the Lakers out to the 3pt line which is an area they aren't as comfortable in.


Im not saying these teams will win, but they're the just the biggest threats",0.69,hot,7/23/20 5:02

549,Thread I stole from twitter about the validity of some advanced stats.,15,hw8dr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw8dr1/thread_i_stole_from_twitter_about_the_validity_of/,19,1595503550,"According to BPM (OBPM, DBPM too)
which “estimates player contribution”,

Kobe (01-10) barely hooped at an All-NBA level (6.0 BPM is thought of as an All-NBA player, Kobe was at 5.7).

Stephen Curry from 2014-16 has a higher DBPM (1.5) than Gary Payton did from 1995-97 (1.2).

Klay Thompson since 2016 has a - 1.7 DBPM. For comparison, James Harden  (1.1), Kemba Walker (-0.5) and Damian Lillard (-0.6) were all apparently superior on defense. 

LeBron in 2009 was a better defender (3.7 DBPM) than Tim Duncan (3.3) and Ben Wallace (3.5) ever were.

Manu Ginobili in 2005 was as good as/better (6.9 BPM) than Michael Jordan in 1998 (6.9 BPM), Kevin Durant in 2019 (5.5 BPM), 2017 Steph Curry (6.9 BPM), 1984-86 Magic Johnson (6.7 BPM), and all but 2 seasons of Kobe Bryant’s 20 year career (5.9 or less).


Bruce Bowen from 2003-08 (his peak) apparently defended worse (1.6 DBPM) than current day Donte DiVincenzo (2.7 DBPM). While we’re on the subject of Donte, his current season is better (DBPM wise) than the best of Kobe’s, Payton’s, Wade’s, Kidd’s, Butler’s, and Holiday’s careers.

Horace Grant (11.4 BPM) apparently matched Michael Jordan’s brilliance (11.5 BPM) in G4 of the 93 Finals....or did he? 

Jordan: 55/8/4 on 61.2% 
Grant: 17/16/2 on 62.3% 

In last years Finals, Siakam’s 32/8/5 in G1 (17.7 BPM) was better than Curry’s 47/8/7 in G3 (17.2 BPM).

Moving on to VORP (basically how much better a player is than the worst player in the league). 

Harden in the 2018 playoffs (1.6 VORP) was about as good as Hakeem in the 1995 playoffs (1.7 VORP). 

Chris Paul from 2008-09 (19.2 VORP) > 2x MVP Tim Duncan from 2002-03 (15.7 VORP).

Kawhi’s 2019 playoff run (2.9 VORP) is as good as the best run Michael Jordan’s ever had (2.9 VORP in ‘92).

LeBron’s 17’ playoff run (33/9/7 on 65% in 18 games with a 2.2 VORP) was BARELY better than LeBron’s infamous 11’ playoff run (24/8/6 on 56% in 21 games with a 2.1 VORP).


1h
2019 Nikola Vucevic (5.5 VORP) is apparently better then any version of Steve Nash (peaked at 5.3), Dwight Howard (peaked at 5.4), and better than all of AI’s seasons except 2001. 

On to Win Shares (basically how many wins a player is responsible for). 

JaVale McGee (4.5 WS) is more valuable to the Lakers this year than Russ (4.3 WS) is to the Rockets. 

Based on his rankings in DWS and DBPM, Nikola Jokic is a top 10 defender this year..

In 2019 Russell Westbrook (5 DWS) was more valuable defensively to OKC than DPOY Finalist Paul George (4.9 DWS). 

These barely scratch the surface, there’s dozens more, but the point of this is: if advanced stats play a big role in your evaluation of players, ...Grimacing face 

From what I’ve gathered, the only advanced stat that’s good is multi-year RAPM. Efficiency stats like eFG% and TS% (my favorite) are good too.

550,[OC] Defining Defensive Success,15,hw85j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw85j7/oc_defining_defensive_success/,0,1595502621,"I'm just an average Joe who really likes defense, and as such, I'm on a quest to clear up misconceptions about how defense works. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/h9srqd/quick_oc_have_defenses_really_gotten_worse/), I attempted to address idea that defenses have gotten worse over time by showing the leagues increase in offensive rating is mostly if not entirely explained by the increase in 3 point attempts and that, relative to offenses, defenses are as good as they've ever been.

This time I want to tackle the idea that ""good offense beats good defense"" or ""offense is more important than defense."" To be absolutely clear, I'm talking about *team* offense and *team* defense, and to compare the two, I'd have to be able directly compare what constitutes success for defense and how it compares to what constitutes success for offense. Let's start simple with defense, a defense is successful when they prevent the offense from scoring, this can be approximately calculated using this formula (all numbers are taken from NBA.com's per 100 possessions stats page):

(FGA - FGM - OFF REB) + TOV% + (100 + OFF REB - FGA - TOV%) x FT%^2.2

Basically, this formula calculates what percentage of the time the defense gains possession of the ball via either 1) a missed field goal attempt that does not result in an offensive rebound, 2) a turnover, or 3) a trip to the free throw line (not caused by an ""and 1"") and all free throws are missed. It's not a perfect formula, I have no way of tracking how often the offense keeps possession after a shot attempt because the ball goes out of bounds last touching a defender, or the actual average number of free throw attempts per trip to the line (I pulled 2.2 out of my butt), it also assumes all free throw shooters are average, but the number should be within an acceptable margin of error. When you plug in the numbers, you get that the defense was successful at keeping the offense from scoring this season...

#52.0% of the time!

Given the margin of error, I'm going to go ahead and round to an even 50%, which is actually incredible. This makes basketball one of the most balanced head to head sports in the world. This is in stark contrast to sports like soccer (sorry non-americans) where the success rate of an offensive possession is tiny because it requires winning several interactions in a row.

**But what about 3 pointers?** Ah yes, to decide how offense compares to defense, we don't need to just define defensive success, but how it compares to offensive success. Unfortunately, that's realistically impossible. Is a made 2 point field goal a successful possession when you could have scored 3? What about a single made free throw? Heck, the total potential point accumulation for a single possession is theoretically infinite due to mechanics like technicals and offensive rebounds from free throw attempts. This conundrum shows that the simple and objective measure of ""did the offense score or not"" fails to actually articulate if a possession was successful or not, teams do things like take lower percentage shots that yield higher point totals on average all the time. The only way to really tell if an offensive possession, and by extension, a defensive possession, is successful is *relatively*. This leads to an interesting problem though, league average offensive and defensive rating are the same number, if we're defining success relatively, then offense and defense will always be of equal value, after all, 1 more point for you has the same net value as 1 less point for the other team, which may sound like the most obvious statement in the world since it's the entire premise of net rating, but it basically means we'll never be able to call one more important than the other.

If you made it through all that, you're probably a nerd like me. I hope it was at least partially interesting. I look forward to the comments, both because I'm sure some of you will find flaws in my reasoning I didn't think of, but also because I find people who believe in the idea offense is inherently more valuable, even on a team level, absolutely hilarious. Next time I plan on tackling the idea *individual* offense is more important than *individual* defense, but that might take a while because that's got a kernal of truth in it.

Hope y'all are staying safe!",0.78,hot,7/23/20 4:10

For the third consecutive year, James Harden leads the league in 3 pointers made.

2017-2018: 265 3PM

2018-2019: 378 3PM

2019-2020: 271 3PM

So if he plays the remaining 8 games, it´s pretty likely that he will finish the regular season with 300 3p FGs for the second year in a row.

Steph Curry though has led the league in 3PM in 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16 and 16-17.

It seems likely that both of them will pass Ray Allen, who is the all time leader in 3 Point Field Goals with 2973. Right now Curry has 2495, Harden 2296.",0.88,hot,7/22/20 15:56

But his final season was botched by the pandemic, where we missed giving him a proper send-off in April, and a celebration of his last game in Toronto. Should he have made his intention to leave the game last year like Dirk and Wade did, seeing how they even got the All Star treatment? It doesn't help that he got overshadowed by Kobe's passing as well (meant no malice with that statement, rest in power to the Mamba).

We've basically had an offseason in the middle of the regular season, allowing players to work on their games/bodies and/or allow lingering injuries to fully heal.

As a result, we could be seeing some significant changes and improvements that we normally only see season to season. It's entirely possible that players who were previously on the cusp of stardom will take that step in the restart.

Which players do you see making a significant improvement during the conclusion of this season?

My pick is **OG Anunoby**, who could've been a breakout defensive star already if he was healthy for 2019's title run. He's shown improvements in his offensive game, and should turn a lot of heads as he gets more TV exposure guarding #1 options in the playoffs.",0.7,hot,7/22/20 22:15

Giannis ranking first overall in defensive win shares, plus-minus and defensive rating.

The eye test also shows you how much space Giannis can cover and how he can guard positions 1-5 really well. 

He makes the Bucks the best defensive team in the NBA by far.

He also needs to play offense. I'm not saying that AD plays little offense but I'm saying that Giannis is the main focus on offense and on defense which is pretty tiring. AD has LeBron to take some load off of him on offense and let AD focus on more defense and still, Giannis ranks higher than AD in all of the advanced defensive stats. Literally the only stat AD leads Giannis in is blocks and we all know that although important, the block stat is not truly reliable.",0.43,hot,7/23/20 14:38

I thought that was normal though, I never really noticed what foot players fade away from but I decided to take notice. Literally every right-handed player fades from their left foot. 

I thought it was normal because I also fade off my dominant foot. I play competitively and have a pretty good fadeaway if I say so myself. I just tried fading off my left and I don't really feel a difference. 

Is it bad fundamentals to do so? Or is it just unorthodox because it's more difficult to do? Is it harder to guard? Does it not matter at all?

I practiced the move by myself so it's not like i had anyone teach me the proper foot work. i just make sure not to travel. 

i also go left to right on two foot jumps (i understand this is abnormal for a right handed person) but finish layups on my left foot if that means anything",0.62,hot,7/23/20 0:36

I'm wondering if people are too confident in the three favorites. Just to be clear, **""money to be made"" doesn't mean the field should be favored to win but that the field should have higher odds than they do**. 

Currently, to win the title [Vegas](https://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/odds/futures/) has the Lakers at +240, the Bucks at +250, and the Clips at +333, with the next highest odds being the Rockets at +1200. Now no one can make accurate decisions on how four months of rust and the Bubble conditions are gonna affect each team. **But it's reasonable to assume there's gonna be a lot more variance in each team's relative performance.** Increased variance hurts the three teams who are runaway favorites over the field. There's a greater chance a worse team will be able to perform better relative to the competition (e.g. as many users here are predicting, the Rockets could get hot at the right time and win a ring due to the unique scenario). Despite this, the betting odds look very similar to how they did in the beginning of March when people didn't know the end of the season would be so abnormal. **While I don't think the ordering of odds should be changed, I don't think the Lakers, Bucks, and Clippers should be such heavy favorites**. 

This seems to be common sentiment among this sub and much of the media: it's highly unlikely a team outside of those three wins the championship. What do you think?",0.82,hot,7/22/20 18:18

For that last spot my friend picked Kawhi, and I picked Westbrook; now, don't get me wrong, if we're talking just the last 4 years in particular, when you take into account efficiency/TS%/defensive performance Kawhi deserves the 5th spot in a landslide; my argument was that if we're considering the entirety of the decade, Westbrook steamrolls Kawhi from an accolades and production standpoint. TLDR: I'd rather have Kawhi as a player overall, but for an all-decade team, I rewarded Westbrook.",0.5,hot,7/23/20 8:21

It’s a good way to benchmark your players capabilities and highlight glaring issues or build on present strengths.

Also, remember at the beginning when Giannis was against Luka in the MVP discussion then it was Harden for a little bit now it's LeBron? That shows the absolute consistency of Giannis.

Oh yeah, if that wasn't enough, Giannis did that all in just 30 minutes per game because the Bucks blew so many teams out that he could just rest at the end.

The league shifted dramatically last offseason and we’ve gotten to see these teams play in the regular season. The 2021 season should be the next “uninterrupted” season and unless something happens in these playoffs, the league should be at full health. Personally, I would love to see a healthy Warriors vs a healthy Nets team. There’s a huge storyline there and the Draymond-KD interactions would be entertaining as hell. Steph and Kyrie also have history from their past matchups. And then there’s always the Steph or KD narrative that kinda led to KD leaving. What are your thoughts?",0.3,hot,7/23/20 17:47

Rose says he doesnt want to be traded so he wont be leaving. Blake has too big of a contract to be traded right now. He will most likely be tradable in the 2021-22 season, but not right now. I'd love to see a rebuild but it cant happen yet. 

They have a talented roster. They are better than all the awful teams in the east and better than the magic for sure. They're record wasnt only bad bc of blake and rose injuries. They also lost Luke Kennard who was having a great season. Reggie Jackson was also injured and then got traded. Blake also played 100% of his games this year while being injured. Theres no way he plays next season like he played this one. 

They got rid of Drummond so they could have room to resign wood. Christain Wood is better than Drummond at every aspect besides rebounding. He can score better, shoot 3s better and dunk better. He also shows potential on the defensive side of the ball. DR Doom is a work in progress but showed a lot of potential. He averaged more points per game than rookie Giannis. Still only 19. I'm not saying the pistons will win 55 games. That's impossible. But they arent as bad as everyone thinks they are. Could they get 50 wins? Maybe. It's possible. But if everyone gets injured again. But if everyone gets injured again.  Then yeah just tank and lose every game possible. 

The 2020-21 pistons have enough talent to be a decent team. They could surprise some people who have doubts. 40-50 wins is what they'll get. Even though I'd like to see atleast a partial rebuild, it just cant happen right away.",0.35,hot,7/23/20 11:38

Hey everyone - in this 4.5 min video analysis, I took a deeper look at how Lakers’ wing Danny Green combines physical attributes, mental tools, and specific techniques to expertly navigate on and off ball screens. Thanks to the mods for letting me post.

Here’s a table of contents, header (sub-headings):

\- 0:00 Intro

\- 0:35 On ball screens (fight over & recover, hand speed & timing, gameplay awareness)

\- 1:57 Off ball screens (single handedly foils entire sequences, evading contact + balance, never panics, reading + communication, showing it all off)

\- 4:10 Outro

For those at work or the hard of hearing, I've transcribed subtitles on YouTube so sound isn't required.

For reference, I’m a DPT and youth basketball coach well-versed in sports science and biomechanics, with sports rehab & performance online consults and clinics in LA. Feel free to hit me with questions.

574,The 2018 Draft was the first since 1984 in which all of the top five picks made the All-Rookie Team the next season,54,hvkyff,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvkyff/the_2018_draft_was_the_first_since_1984_in_which/,18,1595412134,"Apologies if this is common knowledge but I thought it was neat fact worth sharing

The 2018 draft was the first draft since 1984 — often considered the greatest draft in NBA history — in which all of the top five picks were selected for the NBA All-Rookie First Team the following season.

2018 Draft:

1. Deandre Ayton
2. Marvin Bagley III
3. Luka Dončić
4. Jaren Jackson Jr.
5. Trae Young

***

1984 Draft:

1. Hakeem Olajuwon
2. Sam Bowie
3. Michael Jordan
4. Sam Perkins
5. Charles Barkley

Perhaps a good omen for the 2018 class moving forward that it can be named alongside the 1984 class? Or perhaps a sign that only three of the top five will end up with Hall of Fame careers?

There were also a couple near-misses with the '91 and '92 draft classes (**bolded** names were voted to the All-Rookie First Team):

1991 Draft:

**1. Larry Johnson**

*2. Kenny Anderson*

**6. Tom Gugliotta**

Interestingly, Jim Jackson put up decent numbers in his rookie season and might've had a shot at getting voted to the first team. But he only played the final 28 games of the season due to a contract holdout. In his own words:

> So when I got drafted, and they tried to offer me a deal that was about what the eighth pick got. So Donald Carter came to Columbus in the big plane, and picked me up, and we were flying over Columbus, and he says, ‘Well Jimmy, I don’t think we should pay a guard this much money, because Randy White and Doug Smith didn’t really work out’

> “And I said, ‘Mr. Carter, no disrespect,’ I said, ‘But that’s not my fault that they didn’t work out.’ I said, ‘Now, I’m the fourth pick. I’m not going to ask for anything more, but I’m not going to take less than what my market value is

[Some interesting quotes from him on that holdout.](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2014/01/26/ex-mav-jim-jackson-divulges-details-of-his-1992-holdout-explains-why-three-js-era-never-panned-out/)",0.95,hot,7/22/20 3:02

And they score at volume, all four of them, which means you can't really fully key-in on just one or two of them. Here's some numbers which highlight just how efficient they are:

All four of them are above-average to elite at pretty much every single facet of offensive play. I wonder what it would take to neutralise such a potent offense. Obviously the defensive side of the floor is a whole different ball-game, but it seems like, in trading their two superstars, OKC may have (unintentionally) stumbled onto something unique here, something that feels and has proven to be sustainable over the course of a season.

But how close has anyone come to winning MVP at an even younger age? Here is every player to finish top 5 in MVP voting at a younger age than Rose was his MVP season. Note: I calculated their age as of January 1st of that season.

|Player|Season|Age in days|MVP Finish|

|Derrick Rose|2010-11|8,124|1st|
|Kevin Durant|2009-10|7,764|2nd|

|Luka Doncic|2019-20|7,612|?|

I included Luka because I think he'll finish top 5 this season, and if he were to win MVP next season, he'd then be the youngest MVP in history. 

Probably not a huge surprise that KD and LeBron came the closest. KD lost to LeBron in MVP voting by a landslide in 2009-10, so to me the answer here is LeBron in 2005-06. LeBron averaged 31/7/7 that season and the Cavs won 50 games with Ilgauskas being their 2nd best player. Ultimately LeBron lost to Nash in MVP voting, but he's got the best case for a player younger than Rose to have won MVP.",0.89,hot,7/21/20 16:51

Russ and Adams were teammates so they already have that chemistry and protective bond. Russ is psychotic and I don’t think would ever give up or run out of energy in a fight. I wouldn’t be surprised if Adams has fought a grizzly bear and won handily (but then calmed it down and befriended it because of how cordial he is lmao)

PJ Tucker is the closest thing to a brick house out of anyone 6’5 and under. Embiid is just one of the most massive players in the league and would have an advantage with his reach over the vast majority of guys 6’10 and up.

I go through my thinking for each team, and give a ranking at the end. Obviously this is all speculation, so feel free to offer your own list.

 Two things:

1. I EXTREMELY stretched the definition of ""star""/""notable"" player for the sake of thoroughness

2. Despite what happened with Porzingus, I don't count people on Rookie contracts because they still have to become restricted free agents and thus have very little leverage (as far as I know, no player worth a max contract has ever taken their qualifying offer to get out of a place sooner)

**Pacific**

**Lakers:**AD could just walk this offseason if he really wanted, really can't see Lebron asking for a trade unless maybe they implode in the playoffs and AD walks (but again, that doesn't seem very likely)

**Clippers:** PG/Kawhi just got there and have player options in 21-22, so it would be more likely they leave than ask for a trade

**Warriors:** Curry seems happy, Klay/Dray just re-signed

**Kings:** Fox is on rookie deal, imo no one else fits the bill

**Suns:** Booker is signed through 23-24, with no player option, so he really doesn't have a lot of leverage 

**Northwest**

**Nuggets:** Jokic is signed through 22-23 and doesn't seem unhappy, Murray begins his 5 year deal next year

**OKC:** Whether CP3 wants out or not is not the issue with trading him lol, SGA is on a rookie deal

**Portland:** Dame/CJ just re-signed and don't seem to be unhappy

**Timberwolves:** Same as Booker, KAT is signed through 23-24 with no player option so he doesn't have a lot of leverage, also they just traded for his buddy D'Lo (who he himself is signed through 22-23)

**Jazz:** The team with the most ""He Gone"" buzz atm. Mitchell is an RFA so unless the team REALLY thinks he will take his QO (which no Max RFA has done before), he doesn't have leverage. However, Gobert has a year left and is in prime position to demand a trade (but there have been rumors, or at least speculation, that the Jazz would want to trade him rather than overpay him anyway)

**Southwest**

**Spurs:** This is assuming DeMar/LMA still count. DeMar has a PO and can walk if he wants. LMA has a year left and it's totally possible he asks for a trade if the team goes in a different direction next year, but he's not exactly a hot commodity at 35 years old and $24 mil

**Mavs:** Zinger just got there/signed, and Cuban is more likely to sell the team than he is to give into a Luka trade demand

**Grizz:** Ja/JJJ are on rookie contracts

**Pels:** BI is an RFA this off-season, and Zion has 0 leverage

**Rockets:** Maybeeee in 1-2 years if this duo isn't successful, but Westbrook/Harden are buddies and probably wouldn't want to break it off after 1 year even if it didn't go well in the playoffs this year. 

**Atlantic**

**Raptors:** Siakam is signed through 23-24, Lowry has 1 more year but they just won the title so he probably stays as long as the team will have him

**Celtics:** Kemba just signed, Brown just got extended, and Tatum is an RFA 

**76ers:** Horford seems unhappy, but he just signed and his contract isn't great so idk if they could even trade him. Harris also just re-signed (and his contract is also not awesome). Simmons is signed through 24-25, and embiid is signed through 22-23 but since there seems to be fit questions about the two together, I could see the team capitulating if one of them do request a trade.

**Nets:** KD/Kyrie just got there, but who knows with Kyrie lol

**Knicks:** RJ is a rookie, and uh, does Mitchell Robinson count?

**Central**

**Bucks:** Giannis is a tough case. The current team is built to his strengths well enough to have won the most games in the regular season two years in a row, and unless this playoffs is a total flame out, he probably will have confidence that next year they will be contenders as well. The only way I see him getting traded instead of walking on his own next year would be him being dead-set on the 5 year supermax for his next team (but everything Giannis has said till now makes it seem like he cares more about winning a championship than getting the absolute most money he possibly can), or there being a team that can offer a great package for him without gutting their team. For those reasons, I think it's more likely he stays one more year rather than request a trade. As for Middleton, his PO isn't until 23-24

**Bulls:** If Lavine counts, he could, but more likely Boylen get fired and Lavine gets to continue to be the man

**Pistons:** They want to trade Griffin lol

**Cavs:** Sexton still on rookie deal, no one wants to give up assets for Love

**Pacers:** Oladipo could request a trade but, with injury issues and one year left, he probably would just want to play out his deal normally to establish his value for the next contract. Sabonis/Turner are both signed for a while, but similar to Embiid/Simmons there are fit issues and the team would probably capitulate if one asked to be traded

**Southeast** 

**Heat:** Bam is RFA, Butler just signed there (and unlike his past two locations, specifically wanted to be here)

**Magic:** Vucci Mane signed til 22/23, Isaac RFA, Gordon is a legit possibility (and yes I'm REALLY stretching the definition of ""notable player"" here)

**Wiz:** Good luck moving Wall, Beal re-signed at the point people previously expected him to say ""get me outta here"" and seems to like being THE guy

**Hawks:** Trae is on rookie deal

**Hornets:** I apologize to Charlotte fans, but even I can't stretch the definitions that far

**Rankings** (based on likelihood, not skill)

1. Gobert

*gap*

2. LMA (If he counts)
3. Lavine (if Boylen isn't fired)
4. Sabonis or Turner
5. Giannis

With that, the cases are locked, the campaigns are closed, and the voting will begin.

While the media may focus on the MVP award and other prestigious honors, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP. **[The LEAST Valuable Player](https://images.app.goo.gl/jwXWsKEJUk6LQhNc6
)**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2016-17, when aging Indiana SG Monta Ellis won the inaugural trophy and then promptly disappeared from the NBA forever. In 2017-18, Minnesota SG [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/?st=jsdf3cqi&sh=70ff7ca4) won the (dis)honor with some incredibly bad defensive numbers. Last season, New Orleans SF [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won LVP by helping to sink a drowning team and accelerating Anthony Davis' decision to fly the coop.  

Before we announce this year's winner, let's review the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet. 

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. For example, the Wizards would have a hard time competing with John Wall on the sidelines (0 games played, $32M in salary), but we want to focus on players' on-court performance instead.

---

######**dishonorable mentions**

**PG Mike Conley, Utah: 28.6 minutes per game, -0.80 RPM**

We're using Mike Conley to reiterate that the LVP does NOT factor salary into the equation any more than the MVP does. But if it *did*, Mike Conley and his $33M salary may be in trouble. 

It was a disastrous start to the season for Conley. Playing in a new role as a second fiddle to another guard, he could never find his groove. His assists plummeted (down to 4.3 per game), his free-throw attempts cut in half (from 5.8 to 2.9), and he only shot 42.9% from two-point range. That said, he still shot pretty well from 3 (37.6%) and played OK defense, keeping him off our official ballot.

**SF Miles Bridges, Charlotte: 30.7 minutes per game, -2.68 RPM**

Like Mike Conley, Miles Bridges seems like a great guy whom you'd hate to criticize. Alas, that's our exercise here. Caught in between positions, Bridges hasn't been able to figure out his rhythm on offense in the NBA either. He hasn't shot well (33% from three, 48.6% from two) and doesn't get to the line enough (2.0 FTA) to make up for it. The advanced stats get even worse from there (although to be fair, they get dragged down by playing in a bad starting lineup.)

Fortunately for him, Bridges is spared by his youth. At 22, he's technically over our ""21 year old"" threshold, but it still feels unfair to pick on his growing pains as a sophomore. Perhaps in time, he can find a role that can take advantage of his athleticism and talent. But be warned: the clock is ticking. We're taking the kid gloves off soon. Bridges and fellow analytics-allergic Kevin Knox (-7.7 RPM!) will be entering Year 3 next season and will need to step their games up to avoid LVP discussion. 

**SF Kyle Kuzma, L.A. Lakers: 24.6 minutes per game, -0.74 RPM**

Kyle Kuzma can score if need be, but his skill set never made him a natural fit to play third banana to superstars like LeBron James and Anthony Davis. He's not a 3+D player -- he's more of a no-3 (30% this year) no-D player. At the same time, the LVP is about negative impact, and it's hard to find much of consequence here. After all, the Lakers still finished with the # 1 record in the West. Kuzma struggling to find his way is like a tree falling in the woods or a person farting in an empty elevator – ultimately it didn't matter.

**SF Andre Iguodala, Memphis/Miami**

It feels like ancient history now, but this past offseason, the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Andre Iguodala in a trade (under the presumption he may be dealt again.) According to official reports, Iguodala and the Grizzlies MUTUALLY decided that he wouldn't play for Memphis and wouldn't even report to the team in the meantime. Okay. Fine. We'll go along with that.

Still, that situation leaves a sour taste in the LVP headquarters. Memphis turned out to be better than expected, and could have used an extra rotational player. And even if Iguodala wouldn't have helped much on the court, he could have been a valuable mentor for their young kids. That's the least you can expect for a nice $15M in salary.

######**our official top 5 LVP ballot**

**(5) PF Anthony Tolliver (POR, SAC, MEM): 15.6 minutes per game, -3.60 RPM**

I've always had a soft spot for the wise ol' owl, Anthony Tolliver. He's reportedly a great teammate and locker room presence. He also started to develop into an effective stretch four towards the end of this career.

But alas, the end of his career may have snuck up on us sooner than we expected. Tolliver disappointed for Minnesota last season, and completely flopped in his return to Portland. At age 34, he doesn't seem to be a viable rotation player anymore. He didn't play quite enough to merit LVP, but he still played more than he should have.

There's a chance Tolliver comes back next year to serve as a veteran mentor and pseudo-assistant coach somewhere, but it's more likely that he retires. If he does, he'll have played for 10 different franchises in his not-so-illustrious but very respectable career.

**(4) SG Bryn Forbes, San Antonio: 25.1 minutes per game, -0.95 RPM**

The NBA is all about shooting these days, and Bryn Forbes can shoot. He's hit an even 40.0% from three during his NBA career so far, and wasn't too far removed from that this season with 38.8% on 6.0 attempts per game. As a result, his true shooting percentage (57%) was above average. The Spurs lacked spacers, and Forbes fit that bill.

So what's the problem...? Turns out, basketball is more than a halfcourt game. And whenever the ball crosses that pesky midcourt line, Bryn Forbes starts to become a liability. 

At only 6'3"", Forbes is undersized to play the SG position, which is where the Spurs played him 74% of the time (according to basketball-reference.) Partly due to those athletic limitations, he only registered 0.5 steals per game, and blocked a grand total of 0 shots in his 1579 minutes of action. The advanced stats get ugly; Forbes ranks near the bottom at his position in DRPM, DBPM, all the alphabet formulas that you can cook up.

At the end of the day, LVP is about negative impact, and there's plenty here. Forbes is not a bad player in a vacuum, but he did not help the Spurs this year. In fact, their undersized lineup is a big reason why they're struggling so much on defense (25th in the NBA). As a direct result, they're on track to miss the playoffs for the first time in decades. 

**(3) SF Mario Hezonja, Portland: 16.3 minutes per game, -2.79 RPM**

During the entire run of the Damian Lillard - C.J. McCollum era, Portland has struggled to figure out their wing rotation. That would be tested even more this season, with familiar faces like Moe Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, and Evan Turner slipping out the door.
The trials and tribulations kept coming like Damian Lillard was Job, as injuries ravaged the Blazers' new depth chart. The team didn't need a star to emerge at forward -- but they needed [*somebody.* Anybody.](https://images.app.goo.gl/yzu1jBoNpAY3DiGC6)

In theory, that player should have been Mario Hezonja, a former lottery pick and a live body with good athleticism and size at 6'8"". Signed this summer for a modest price ($1.7M), Hezonja had the chance to jumpstart his NBA career with a major opportunity on the team. Instead, he flopped like Marcus Smart taking a phantom elbow.

Hezonja's biggest problem is that, at age 25, he still hasn't found his feel on the court. He's not a good shooter (32.8% from three), and doesn't use his athleticism to find his way to the line (1.1 attempts per game.) He was a non-factor (5 PPG, 3 RPG) on a team that desperately needed him to step up. In fact, the Blazers were so desperate for help that they not only signed Carmelo Anthony, but they played him over 32 minutes a game.

Again, we see a real ""LVP"" candidacy here with a direct effect on the standings. The Blazers' getting a big fat nothing from Hezonja was a major part of their struggle to get to .500 this season.

**(2) C Dewayne Dedmon, SAC/ATL: 17.6 minutes per game, -2.51 RPM**

We're not supposed to factor in salaries into this equation, but Dewayne Dedmon's situation merits a mention for context. The Sacramento Kings signed the big man to a head-scratching 3-year, $40M deal this summer (seriously.) Clearly, GM Vlade Divac thought his young Kings were only a few veterans away from making the playoffs, bringing in (and over-paying) Dedmon, Cory Joseph, and Trevor Ariza.

Among the three, Dedmon turned out to be the most disappointing for several reasons. He didn't play well to start the season, and got usurped in the rotation by underrated Richaun Holmes. Rather than suck it up, take a deep breath, and take a relaxing dive in his new Scrooge McDuck money pool, Dedmon started to whine and complain and push for a trade. For a team that was struggling, Dedmon's headache became the *last* thing they needed. Ultimately, they ditched him back to where he came from in Atlanta.

Now, being difficult and being a prima donna isn't enough to get you LVP honors. You have to stink on the court as well. And sure enough, Dedmon started to check those boxes. Billed as a stretch five after hitting some threes in Atlanta, Dedmon lost his shot in the SMF airport baggage claim. He shot only 19.7% from three for the Kings, registering a 47.3% true shooting percentage on the season. His defense is OK, but it's not good enough make up for his poor offensive play. He's not bad *enough* to get LVP, but he hurt his team this year.

**(1) PG Isaiah Thomas, Washington: 23.1 minutes per game, -2.75 RPM**

We've awarded three LVP trophies in the past, and a familiar pattern is starting to emerge. The most dangerous players aren't necessarily the *bad* players; they're the players who used to be *good.* Because of their prior success, they tend to get overplayed by their coaches and drag their teams down with them.

It wasn't too long ago that Isaiah Thomas found himself in the MVP conversation for the Boston Celtics, as his incredible shotmaking helped make up for any defensive limitations he may have as a 5'9"" player. That said, a small player like Thomas is always going to have a thin margin for error to remain a winning player. He needs to be GREAT offensively to make up for his defense. Unfortunately, his offense has not been great since his infamous injury. He can still make shots (hitting 41.3% of his threes), but he's not getting inside the paint and not getting to the free-throw line (1.9 attempts per game.) As a result, his true-shooting percentage lagged to 53.1%, well below league average.

If Isaiah Thomas isn't making scoring efficiently, then what is he doing to help a team win? He's not a great distributor (3.7 assists per game.) He's a very poor rebounder (1.7 per game.) And yes, that defense is still a major problem. According to ESPN's RPM metric, Thomas graded as a -4.2 impact per 100 possessions, the second worst in the league at PG after Trae Young. Basketball-reference lists his ""defensive rating"" at 121. For comparison's sake, the worst team defense in the league still held teams under 116. (That worst team? The Wizards.)

You can make an argument that there's still a place for Thomas in the NBA as a sparkplug scorer off the bench. Alas, that's not how the Wizards had been using him this season. He started 37 of 40 games for the team. Largely as a result of that, the Wizards' starting lineup was atrocious defensively. Fellow starters like Bradley Beal and Rui Hachimura ranked toward the bottom of their position in defensive metrics as well. When your lineup stinks defensively, a good coach may look in the mirror and say: hey, maybe we need a change here. Sadly, quick reactions are not Scottie Brooks' strong suit. He has the type of sloth-like speed that even frustrate workers at the DMV. The Wizards *eventually* dumped IT, but it took far too long to make that shift.

To be fair, the Wizards' options at point guard were limited with John Wall injured. Veteran Ish Smith is mediocre right now, and Shabazz Napier arrived late in the season. Still, the point here is: almost *any* competent point guard (like a Napier) would have helped the Wizards more than Isaiah Thomas. He had become a negative for them. The cold hard truth is that: it's very difficult to win basketball games with Thomas starting. And given that, he is our official **LVP.**",0.96,hot,7/20/20 14:06

In middle school while Shaq was playing for the Sun's I went trick or treating with my friend from Boy's and Girl's club basketball who lived in his neighborhood. Shaq gave out king sized candy bars because he wouldn't have been able to open the fun sized candy bars people normally gave out.

Steph finished tied for 7th last year, and it's possible he's the best golfer in the NBA universe right now. Ray Allen might be the only challenger (finished 3rd in this event a few years ago but didn't play this year). 

There was a shortage of other current/former NBA folks in this year's tournament, likely due to Covid. Other notable NBA/basketball finishers:

* Vinny Del Negro - also tied for 7th with Dell Curry

* Deron Williams - 13th

In the NBA there's a problem with only half of the league being competitive and the other half don't really care about that season and are only focused on snagging a star through the draft or free agency. The draft promotes complacency, bad teams are okay with being bad because they'll get good players because of it. And the top 4 teams are leveraging everything they have to win it this year because their window might be closing. 

I think what relegation systems are useful for is increasing the level of play because it forces even the worst teams to be competitive and fight in every game. Relegation would really be beneficial in the MLS because the league is so much weaker than other international leagues. But the NBA is by far the best league in the world and if you put the worst team in the NBA in Euroleague it would probably win. And the best players not in the NBA would not score more than 10 points a game (I know Luke exists he was just too young to play in the NBA)

No other sport has an equivalent award and it's close to meaningless. It just means the best player that doesn't start, which is already a pretty arbitrary distinction depending on your team makeup. The most prominent examples of how arbitrary that can be are Harden in 2011-12 and Ginobli 07-08. Both of those guys would have started in just about any other team in the league but their team makeup made it beneficial for them to come off the bench. Then, they always closed games for their team. With the exception of Jamal Crawford in 2013-14, every 6MOTY has been top 5 in minutes on their team dating back to 2005. 

Even if we took that arbitrary distinction out of the picture, what does the 6MOTY mean? The 151st best player in the NBA?

601,Giannis has played less MPG than Dennis Schroeder and just 1.6 more MPG than Lou Williams,22,hxtgnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxtgnb/giannis_has_played_less_mpg_than_dennis_schroeder/,31,1595737101,"I know one of the biggest things people highlight about Giannis is his effectiveness in absurdly low minutes, but I never really put it into perspective like this. He’s putting up an MVP campaign in 6th man minutes.

Giannis has also played the same MPG as Joe Harris, and 1.6 MPG less than Marcus Smart, another very notable 6th man. 

Granted, all of these players basically play starter minutes, but their minutes are de facto restricted on their team because the starter at their position is more well-rounded and hence deserves more minutes (except for Lou’s case) except in certain circumstances. Giannis has no such restriction. Him playing more than he does is literally unsportsmanlike with the way he dominates. 

He’s even played less minutes than “Mr. Load Management” Kawhi Leonard, despite Kawhi having a far better supporting cast to ease his minutes. 

He is 63rd in the league in minutes, putting up top 5 rebounding and points per game, and is top-2 on his team in **every statistical category** except 3-pt shooting. Not to mention top-2 DPOY candidate. 

It’s just wild that his play style is basically auto-load-managing. He could play more if he wanted to. He doesn’t have to. They still have the best record in the league and he’s the runaway MVP. 

I just don’t see anyone can make a case against this man for not just MVP but a historic season. He just can’t stop getting better. 

Tangentially speaking of trajectories, Pascal Siakam is basically gonna be this man with slightly less dominance but a way better jump shot in just 1-2 more years. It’s a good time to be an NBA fan.

602,I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.,89093,dt0ucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/,4274,1573175984,"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\[CITY\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

There are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) 

As you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores.

 

[ google search results for generic query \\""San Antonio Women\\""](https://preview.redd.it/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)

From his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  


***But did you ever wonder why… Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***

  
***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***

So began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…

&#x200B;

# The Research

I started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… 

* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? 
* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and
* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?

Well let’s break it down one-by-one…

 

**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**

I compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…

[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)

As it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.

Interesting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.

[google trend statistics for search term \\""bbw\\""](https://preview.redd.it/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)

 *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*

 

**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**

Using [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.

[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)

Again, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).

I guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.

*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*

 

**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**

Tremendously, that’s how.

I literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros & Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!

Using cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\[CITY\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).

[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)

Well Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… 

&#x200B;

We have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?

&#x200B;

# The Analysis

With my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \*sniff\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.

Charles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…

&#x200B;

**‘The Biggest Loser’**

Between the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the ""*curious""* column.

* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)
* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)

 

[ W\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https://preview.redd.it/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)

Now I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.

&#x200B;

**‘My -25% Life’**

San Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:

* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg
* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg
* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg

Note: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\*FG)–(0.7\*FGA)–\[0.4\*(FTA-FT)\]+(0.7\*ORB)+(0.3\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\*AST)+(0.7\*BLK)–(0.4\*PF)-TOV*

Here’s what the analysis looks like:

[ Barkley performance analysis via heat mapping ](https://preview.redd.it/bm4bja82nwg41.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8908dd66fda7cb895c93a1f498644ed734988d1)

You can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.

Heat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*).

These huge performance declines are damning. But what do they truly *tell us*?

&#x200B;

#  Conclusion

Well, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?

Every Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t hit free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.

For Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.

The Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).

The excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…

>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  
>  
>  
*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*

It is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. 

That’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**

**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™. In fact, it’s** ***great.***

606,Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:,30997,6cbgx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6cbgx1/wilt_chamberlain_secretly_dominated_professional/,1490,1495329131,"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http://imgur.com/vNZZsm5)

Calculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:

* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)

* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)

* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)

* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league

Wilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, ""George Marcus"", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.

This is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.

*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!

*EDIT*

IMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http://www.bardown.com/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He ""only"" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!",0.92,top,5/20/17 18:12

608,Bad officiating calls in Warriors-Rockets G7,26705,8mzetu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8mzetu/bad_officiating_calls_in_warriorsrockets_g7/,3108,1527632056,"Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.

#Calls going against Rockets:

1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.

2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.

3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.

4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).

5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)

6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)

7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)

8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.

#Calls going against Warriors:

1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.

2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

609,How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets.,24926,4e8ikq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4e8ikq/how_my_nba_experience_turned_into_a_nightmare/,1360,1460365294,"**4/11 - Here is an update since I don't think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me.**
___________________________________

StubHub has reached out to me and advised me that, in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats, they will get me tickets to the home opener next year.

The rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation. I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.
I'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.
__________________________________



**TL:DR – StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) – they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**
_______________

Let me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.

I am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of… everything.  We don’t have much.  We haven’t been to the playoffs in 10 years – the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.

I’ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building – Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  

The entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena – tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don’t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It’s the only real arena we have ever had – we don’t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  

It is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a “cow town” – unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.

After all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team – Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.

With that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the “old barn” after 28 years.

I was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources – Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others – Craigslist comes to mind.  

I would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub – I’ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.

Unfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.
 
Yesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 – expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  

The Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures – it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.

I [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.

We arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I’ve ever seen it.

We made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn’t register so I tried again.  REFUND.

At this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed – like I was some scammer or didn’t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  

I pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  

The door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, “I’m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can’t help you – you need to call them but they’re very good at refunds.”

REFUND.  There’s that word again.  

I don’t want a refund – I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, “all of our representatives are assisting other callers – we will be with you shortly.”

I am basically beside myself by now – I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets – plus fees.  

I can’t believe what I am hearing.  I still don’t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.

I don’t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, “man, I’m so sorry – we’ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.”

7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm

By 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line – after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.

He was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, “Did the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.”  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.

I couldn’t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game – this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That’s when he dropped the bomb on me.

He said, and I quote, **“I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.”**

So there it is – StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  

He told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn’t then, and it’s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.

We went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot – with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn’t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.

The final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their “guarantee” to get you in the game.  I couldn’t believe it.  

As soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, “oh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.”  I knew I got my refund last night!  

I asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, “No I don’t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It’s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.”  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I’m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.

A couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  

I have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:

* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?

* Why does StubHub not warn it’s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?

* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn’t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.

- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.

* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative’s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.

Here is StubHub’s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):

**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**

* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*

* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*

* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*

*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*


I was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.


I apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this.",0.88,top,4/11/16 2:01
610,Lakers/Raptors fans should turn the Kawhi situation into something positive.

Could be something nice coming out of all this increased attention.

Wow this blew up quick. I'm going to turn off mailbox replies lol.

I'm a Toronto fan so I'll be making a $20 donation to https://www.chla.org/ if Kawhi signs with Toronto. I hope others do the same.

Toronto's Childrens Hospital is Sick Kids Hospital - https://www.sickkids.ca/

I've cross posted this to both /r/torontoraptors and /r/lakers as well to get more eyes on it.

FINAL EDIT: 

So this is a turn of events. Clippers got him. I honestly thought they weren't really in the running anymore and it was a toss up between Lakers and Raptors. As I've said in comments I never meant any disrespect to Clippers fans and congrats to them! When they were brought up I really didn't know how to do a 3 way deal between 2 cities. Now that here here though...

The spirit of the wager was the winning team donates to the other teams kids hospital. Clippes fans have wanted to be in this so much I'm hoping now they step up. I'd suggest donating to either city's kids hospital. You want to keep your donation local give to CHLA, want to show Toronto some love give to Sick Kids in Toronto. for Lakes and Raptors fans I'm suggesting they each give to the other charity. As a Raptors fan I'm still going to give to CHLA. There is no reason not to in my mind.

I'm glad my post could bring people together in a positive way and I know some good has come out of it.

FINAL FINAL EDIT:

I know this post is old now but I wanted to show that I put my money where my mouth is:

611,People don't talk enough about how awful the Hornets are,23661,cecxoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cecxoc/people_dont_talk_enough_about_how_awful_the/,2738,1563399363,"* One of only 6 teams in the NBA/NFL/MLB/NHL that's never even made a conference finals. They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.

* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.

* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.

* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.

* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.

* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.

* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.

* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.

* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.

* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.

* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.

* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.

612,Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night,23520,bowigy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bowigy/rachel_nichols_and_the_espn_crew_were_extremely/,2420,1557946856,"I’m not sure if this has been posted by someone already, but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams, save for maybe the Knicks, to all of the other draft picks, and to the Pelicans. Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. 

First off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don’t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.

Then, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as “who gets Zion.” Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it’s only going to Zion?

And finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team’s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an “asset” to trade for AD. I’m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.

Now I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said “no.”

EDIT: Apparently, there are rumors circulating that Rachel Nichols was drunk. Honestly...that’s not surprising",0.88,top,5/15/19 12:00

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

LeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it’s more convenient than moving to a different city.

**Dallas Mavericks**

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

Justice is served! Josh reach out and sent me this.
Thank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!

Back in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.
He made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.
The conversation went as follows:

 http://imgur.com/gallery/WkSFMJm

We agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.

He did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.

That was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.

I have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.

So please Josh....just pay up bro.

Because DeSean’s post was a quote attributed to Hitler, it cannot be debated that it wasn’t anti-Semitic and thus I don’t see any possible errors with the title. PLEASE leave this up for discussion. We need some kind of discourse.

I’m amazed and shocked by this. For those who don’t know, [DeSean Jackson posted a quote from Hitler](https://imgur.com/gallery/gSb7eyd) (edit- now said to be Farrakhan but written as Hitler) last night on his Instagram. Stephen Jackson replied with [this video today](https://streamable.com/yk2vur) about the whole situation, saying Jackson was “speaking the truth” and trying to get educated. The comments of the post also encourage the same “Jews control everything” hate that have fueled terrors of the past, with [Stephen Jackson even replying to one of them.](https://imgur.com/a/7YFggCE?fbclid=IwAR325lH10U5judJVIOxr3o3Ay-OUV6k7muLRgMCYMTzQxkoNVZPS58Cy-uI)

I’m extremely disappointed by Stephen Jackson (who has been a face of BLM) as well as this not getting traction in the media yet and even getting removed here. We say we are anti-hate but we can’t have double standards when we do so.

**EDIT-** Stephen Jackson deleted the video and has posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCXdZpzlVEf/), basically doubling down on his comments with a follow-up just as infuriating as the first post. He has seen a bit of backlash on IG (and some praise) but this should really be a bigger story given his platform and following. **How is it getting almost no traction in the NBA world?** The majority of the responses to this thread here have been really encouraging to see, and to the people commenting “Well, Jews do run everything”… I urge you to read about how dangerous this notion has been in history, particularly in the context of the Holocaust.

Her first statement after the tragedy. 

“My girls and I want to thank the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time. Thank you for all the prayers. We definitely need them. We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe — the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna — a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri. We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality. To honor our Team Mamba family, the Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the MambaOnThree Fund to help support the other families affected by this tragedy. To donate, please go to MambaOnThree.org.

617,The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.,22824,byskdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/byskdn/the_outrage_of_nba_fans_is_disproportionate/,2960,1560163772,"I'd like to preface this by stating that what GSW part-owner Mark Stevens did in game 3 was unacceptable. He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.

&nbsp;

However, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.

&nbsp;

I realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. 

&nbsp;

The public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.

&nbsp;

People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.

&nbsp;

>""A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.""

&nbsp;

>""The support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done.""

&nbsp;

>""I have 2 young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard. Which I do. I hold myself to a high, high standard.""

&nbsp;

These are all quotes from Kyle Lowry. The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. 

&nbsp;

This was one of his quotes on that day:

&nbsp;

>""B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!""

&nbsp;

He then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. 

&nbsp;

If Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?

&nbsp;

In August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. 

&nbsp;

Two years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.

&nbsp;

He went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. 

&nbsp;

At the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. 

&nbsp;

I was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.

&nbsp;

OJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to ""drugs of abuse"" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.

&nbsp;

Jason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.

&nbsp;

Darren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.

&nbsp;

I'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA.

Not even once.,21047,8xkmtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8xkmtb/carmelo_anthony_was_never_a_top_5_player_not_even/,2059,1531222303,"I was in the ""538 Hates Melo"" thread, about to reply to someone arguing ""Melo actually used to be top 5,"" then I decided, fuck it. I've *always* hated melo's game. 

What follows is me trying to illustrate that not only was Melo not a top 5 player *of his era*, he was never a top 5 player at all.  Not even fucking once. I'm doing this for me.

### Melo, at a glance
* only twice made it out of the first round
* 215th all-time in ws/48, tied with Corey Maggette
* not in top 250 for career TS%
* not in top 250 for career Offensive Rating
* made up for this relative inefficiency by not passing much or trying on defense
* [tried to combat questions about work ethic by posting video of himself jogging](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWCHXsYDoXx/?utm_source=ig_embed)
* [this entire article](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/11904296/new-york-knicks-forward-carmelo-anthony-wants-bulletproof-reputation)

#### The Most Overated Player of his Era

Anthony has made 10 all-star games, and was often cited  as a top 5 player.

Carmelo's net offensive and defensive rating are the exactly the same (108). That means he's giving up a lot of what he gives you. And 108, as mentioned above, isn't anything special.  [Here is the full list of players who have made at least 3 all-star games with Carmelo's defensive rating or worse, capped at Melo's offensive rating.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=combined&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=3&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=def_rtg&c1comp=gt&c1val=108&c2stat=off_rtg&c2comp=lt&c2val=108&order_by=ws)

###Melo in Denver 
""Melo was actually good in denver!"" Sure!  ""Melo was a top 5 player in denver!"" [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DCJXYbBB7w) While more dynamic than his plodding, interminably jab-stepping, Knicks iteration, he was never actually a top 5 player. He only made it out of the first round once.
 
####First: Melo has never been better than LeBron. 
Lebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on.

####Second: Denver Melo was  *never* better than Kobe or Dirk
From 2005-2012, there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk. Melo *never* finishes above these guys in all-nba over this period. Not once. More importantly, with the benefit of retrospect, we can see these two (along with LeBron) were great every season, always healthy, and whenever they had *any* talent around them, contended for titles/MVPs. They got everything out of their team, year after year. There's not a single season you wouldn't trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver.  (To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in 2009, when he beat the Mavs in the second round: Dirk averaged 34/12/4 on 53/38/92 shooting in that series--if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team, they would've been even better. Dirk was also 1st team All-Nba to Melo's 3rd. Melo also didn't even make the all-star team.)

So: Melo is at best, the 4th best player any season from 2005-2012. I now just have to establish that there were at least *2* other guys who were better each season during that period, and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top 5 rankings.

#### Numbers 4, 5, 6 
Here i'm going to list three players (in any order), that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season. Why three, when I only need two? Because fuck Melo. Honestly, in a lot of these seasons I could list ~10+ players. Finally, just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they're no longer better than Melo--they probably are--it's just that there are 3 more inarguable players.

### Melo in New York
Unlike his team USA compatriots, Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam, instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks. While not as athletic as Denver Melo, it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter. It's also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games. He won *one* playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks. In the east, guys.

And then it got worse. Knicks Melo never made the playoffs, let alone an all-nba team after 2013, so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top 5 purposes. Just because people still *thought* he was good, I went all the way to 2015, where became pretty clear he's wasnt even top 15 anymore. Kobe and Dirk start declining here, so I expanded it to **4** players besides LeBron. Still wasnt very hard. Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non-Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo.

As a sidenote: the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in 3 of the next 4 seasons (including 57 in 2012), and only finished behind in 2014 by 1 game (37 to 36).

##### 2013: The year Melo might have been top 5
Ok, even I have to admit this. In 2013, Melo has a decent case for his only top 5 season. He leads the league in scoring, shoots a good percentage, and even wins a playoff series. It's by far his best season as a Knick, and likely, the best season of his career. He has a career high in ws/48, with .184, and finishes 9th overall in offensive win shares (really high for him).

Melo also finishes 3rd in MVP voting, and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time (and being in NYC), he did have a great year. 

Still though: LeBron, Durant, clearly better. CP3 has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference.  Tim Duncan makes 1st team all-nba, and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals. Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year, wins more games, and goes to the western conference finals. He finishes *3rd* in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant. It's counter-intuitive, but Gasol has a really strong argument. That's 5, but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation, and honestly, I'd take either of them over Melo in 2013. That's 7. 

Maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe Melo was top 5 in 2013. But that would be his *one* year as a top 5 player. One very debatable season. The next year he misses the playoffs and falls out of the conversation forever.

The shitposts were posted by nephews with care, 
in hopes that sweet upvotes soon would be there,

The Canadians were nestled all snug at Tim Hortons, visions of Nav dancing, they cried out “oh Board Man” 

And Magic in LA and Ballmer there too,
They’d just calmed the hell down, which was long over due.

When all of a sudden there arose a new tweet, 
People sprang to hit new, to see who had who beat. 

Away to their phones they flew like a flash
They smashed on f5, and prayed the whole internet didn’t crash.

Lebron sees his chance of a new superteam grow, 
But ask him if it is one and I’m sure he’ll say no,

When what to our wondering eyes should appear,
Why a brand new post right there in the clear,

With a little bold writer, so lively and quick,
I knew in that moment a woj bomb I did click,

More rapid than raptors his words they came,
And he stayed very silent, his sources he never names,

Now SIMMONS, now SHAMS, now SKIP and SHANNON, 
on RDA, on Masai, on Windhorst and JALEN,

To the top of the window! To the Top of r/all!
The excitement’s so palpable there’s sweat on my balls. 

As band wagoners that before a big trade trade fly,
When someone calls out their flair switch, they say “bye bitch, bye.”

False alarm?! Yes sadly, Woj did have some news,
about the Greek freak?!... YES! but just about his new shoes,

They sprang to their helicopter, the cameramen they did go, 
And away they all flew to a car, #tbt to that white bronco. 

But I heard the Klaw say as he drove out of sight,
He.He.He. Indubitably, Happy Kawhismas to all, and to r/all good night!",0.86,top,7/4/19 2:28
621,I sold Josh Hart a Nintendo Switch in 2017. And he has paid me back,20171,collc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/collc1/i_sold_josh_hart_a_nintendo_switch_in_2017_and_he/,1015,1565490032,"A few months ago I posted about my situation with now former Los Angeles Lakers Guard, Josh Hart. If your not familiar with the story, [here it is](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/brvala/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

I never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.

July 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c134ht/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.

[He sent me a box in the mail.](https://imgur.com/a/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.

Being a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.

If there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.

Edit: Apologies if I came off as asking for more. That was not my intention whatsoever. I could've made a better choice of words, but I don't expect anymore. I could've done without the smash Bros comment, but I wasn't asking for more. I got more than I asked for.",0.87,top,8/10/19 19:20

> Gay: The most he talked was on the hard court, and Kawhi was not afraid to let you know that you weren’t going to score on him, that you couldn’t get past him or that he would score on you. Every time the ball went through the net, he just said, “Bucket. Bucket.” That was it.

> Tyrone Shelley, guard: Most people say it like, “Oh, I’m about to get buckets on you.” He was just like, “Buckets. Layup.” Just one word.

> Shelton: He’d be like, “You’re not scoring. You’re not doing anything.” Or he’d be like, “No, no, no.” He’d just move his feet and say, “No.”

> Gay: You couldn’t score on him, so that’s what he would say: “Nope, nope, nope.” And when he would score on you: “Bucket. Bucket.”

> LaBradford Franklin, guard: If he was grabbing a rebound, he’d say, “Give me that” or “Board man” or “Board man gets paid.”

> Coach Hutson: If I heard it once, I heard it 50 times. “Board man. I’m a board man.” That’s what he said. Absolutely. “I’m a board man. Yeah, I’m a board man. Board man gets paid.” He spoke in phrases like that.

> Shelley: Instead of saying, “We need to walk to the store” or “Let’s go to the store,” he’d just say, “I’m up.” When he leaves, he just says, “I’m up.”

> Shelton: If he joked, it would be like one or two comments, and he’d go like, “Yeeee.” He’d make more sounds than he actually talked.",0.95,top,6/4/19 20:17
623,"Not enough is made of the fact that LeBron got Kevin Love to join him in Cleveland and commit long-term, but then LeBron himself didn't commit long-term and routinely undercut Love in one way or another. And through all that Love never complained once and appreciated everything.",18652,8yyx4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not_enough_is_made_of_the_fact_that_lebron_got/,1420,1531654541,"Kevin Love changed his game more than anyone to adapt to playing with LeBron. He also bore the brunt of LeBron's frustrations during his Cavs tenure with indirect jabs and rumors of trades involving Love.

This is a summary of how Brian Windhorst described it on The Lowe Post:

> Kyrie Irving ""opted out of what Love is dealing with,"" Windhorst said. ""Love deals with the persecution of being a LeBron teammate, of being blamed, of dealing with his social-media undercutting, of being the fall guy, as he's called himself.""

> He added: ""There have been so many days and nights where Kevin Love has walked out of a building feeling beleaguered or beaten down either directly because of LeBron"" or indirectly.

> But Windhorst says Love insists that it's all worth it because playing with James also means playing late into the season and competing for championships.

> ""I have to give Kevin a real major hat tip for being a professional and being an adult about it,"" Windhorst said. ""He has always seen the big picture ... He has always maintained that this is all worth it, that playing in these late games — I mean, this is a guy who played for six years, whatever it was, never sniffed the playoffs. He's like: 'This is where I'm at right now. This is the charge for playing with [James].'"" 

For fuck's sake, Kevin Love literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with LeBron.

Despite all that LeBron to the very end never seemed to appreciate what Love went through for him. When he signed with the Lakers, Love found out from a notification and HE called LeBron to tell him he loved him.

Man, I just really admire Kevin Love and his strength and big heart in the face of what he puts up with.

627,Is having Lebron really worth the trouble?,17470,6olkrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6olkrv/is_having_lebron_really_worth_the_trouble/,1009,1500638686,"People were interested in seeing how I came up with the value Lebron brings to the Cavs, Dan Gilbert, and Downtown Cleveland as a whole. I've decided to make this thread so those that were interested could see how I arrived at the valuation.

A few days ago an interesting thread arose accusing Lebron of handicapping the Cavs this offseason. Because of his contract demands for his friends, the Cavs could not make many offseason moves. Further, they're having to pay tens of millions in luxury tax just to make this man happy. This prompted u/jushin33 to ask:
> Has anyone looked at how much value Cavs would lose if Lebron left vs the tax savings? 

Why is Dan Gilbert so willing to pay out the nose in luxury taxes rather than let Lebron walk and pocket the savings? Surely he's not worth it at this point, right? 

Let’s begin by looking at attendance before we get into the financial aspect. How many more faces travel to Quicken Loans Arena to see the King?

> Attendance prior to return: 17,329
> Return: 20,562
> 2017: 20,562

Given 41 home games, this is 132,553 more people coming in yearly compared to the most recent season without him.

With playoffs that is at LEAST another 164,496 people whose offseason has not come early provided there is a minimum 8 playoff home games. To get this number I accounted for the fact that QLA would have a patronage of 0 because the team has not made the playoffs without Lebron in the last 20 years, so each home game is an increase by 20,562. 

Interesting to note, Quicken Loans Arena max capacity is, you’ve guessed it, 20,562 people. The arena has been sold out every game since Lebron’s return. 
 
Now let's look at revenue:
> Year before: $145M
> Return: $149M
> 2017: $233M

I’m going to say 2015 was an outlier year. Lebron announced his return in July, 3 months before the NBA season began. The organization may have needed time to adjust to the sudden good fortune. In 2016, after having Lebron for a full regular and offseason, the team took advantage of his prowess, posting a revenue of $191M.

A lot of people asked about playoff revenue. The Cavaliers make an average of $81 per fan at full capacity during the regular season. Assuming a sweep each round, we get 8 hosted home games per post season. **This gives us $13,324,176 a year in revenue brought in** **SOLELY FROM HAVING LEBRON ON THE TEAM**. He’s been a lock to make the finals every year and, for a team that suffered four straight years of zero playoff games, this is literally money they would not see without him.

The Cavaliers had an operating loss of 40m in the 2017 season. I should note that this is the only loss the team has seen since drafting Lebron. This is wholly attributed to the dramatic increase in player expenses this year. In 2016 the team spent 87M on players. In 2017, this number rose to a whopping $131M. Before that, the Cavaliers went from an average operating income of $10m a year without Lebron, to $22.5M a year between 2015-2016. This is interesting to note because, given these figures, the team’s actual operating hit from adding Lebron drops to around $16M. 

Mr. Gilbert has suffered a net loss from re-signing Lebron of $16M…so far. Let’s see if he makes it back into the black. 


The Cavalier’s player expense hit is a sight to behold. Luxury tax ain’t no joke. However, after this season, the Cavaliers have a lot of salaries coming off the books and will only have $80-90M in owed player expenses. Were Dan Gilbert to resign Lebron, find cheaper talent, and maintain a revenue stream of, let’s say $200M to be conservative, he would make out like a bandit. Lebron would demand a salary higher than Curry’s and Harden’s, yes, but the team also has multiple deals coming in that would offset this. Goodyear, I believe, just signed on a $10m/year logo placement and the local tv deal of ten years at $26m a year ended this past season and is expected to at least double when the new deal is signed. All of that is in the future, however. Let’s look at what Lebron has already brought him.
> **Edit: Some people are taking issue with his impact on the valuation of the team as a whole. Whether it be the Clippers sale or revenue sharing. It was just a quick thing I noticed while putting this together and thought it would be interesting to add. Has no effect on the amount of revenue Lebron generates yearly. Dude brings in bank. I'll still leave it below, though.** 
> 
> Cavs value year before return: 515M
> Year of: 915M
> 2017: $1.2B
> 
> Wow. Dan Gilbert’s networth is $5.1B. The team he purchased at $375M has ballooned to become an asset worth $1.2B. ~~Lebron is literally responsible for $825M of his net worth from basketball operations alone.~~

Basketball operations alone? Donajello, are you saying that Lebron has generated even MORE wealth for Dan Gilbert? Short answer: yes. Long answer: …you should probably sit down for this.

With foot traffic in downtown Cleveland skyrocketing with everyone coming to watch Lebron play, it is only natural that local businesses would reap the rewards. Dan Gilbert is the largest solo investor into the downtown Cleveland economy. He has invested more than $1B into the area and is the owner of 12 local businesses. This includes clubs, bars, and restaurants – all things people look for after a high-octane game. Bar owners in the area, ranging from small to large, have seen an increase in revenue of 30-200% on game nights. Demand for local hotel rooms have risen 8.6% since Lebron’s return. Lebron’s presence “increased the number of restaurants within 1 mile of a stadium by about 12.8% and the number of eating and drinking establishments by about 13.7%” to meet demand per a Harvard study. Employment in the hospitality industry in increased 9.9% upon the King’s return.

How much is all this worth? A study funded by the city of Cleveland along with the Cavaliers that was conducted by The Plain Dealer estimated in 2010 that Lebron James was key to bringing $135 per additional person downtown to see a home game. This includes parking, dinners, occasional hotels, and other expenses. That’s about $600k a night and $18,265,500 a year. The study also estimated that the downtown area sees an increase in foot traffic of 105,000 during playoffs. That gives us $113,400,000 over 8 home games. Note: the original estimate in the study of $180 included ticket prices. I’ve removed the $45 average ticket price because we are solely looking at revenue outside of the stadium. Their number did NOT include concession spending. 

**TL;DR: Dan Gilbert suffered a $40m loss, $27m of that coming from luxury taxes last season. Lebron increased team revenue by $88M from the highest grossing year without him to today. Outside of the stadium Lebron is responsible for $18,265,500 in spending during the season in downtown Cleveland, and $113,400,000 during playoffs. Dan Gilbert owns the Cavaliers and is the largest investor into downtown Cleveland to the tune of over $1B and 12 businesses.**

**Lebron has brought in about $219,665,500 a year just by coming back home.**

**Why would Dan Gilbert and the organization hop, jump, and skip to please Lebron, even to the point of paying exorbitant luxury taxes to sign his friends? Well, the proof is in the numbers. No king has been this profitable since Midas.**  

Edit 2: Lebron has even brought me gold. Is there anything this man cannot do? Seriously, thank you kind stranger.

Going to quickly clarify a few common questions. (Like 100 folks asked the same things)

1. The City of Cleveland reported an increase in traffic to the downtown area of 105,000 PER DAY A HOME PLAYOFF GAME WAS PLAYED. $135 * (105,000*8) for the lowest estimate.

2. $135 doesnt mean every person literally spent $135 per night. The city took their increased revenue and divided by the increased traffic on game nights.

3. No Dan Gilbert doesn't make every penny of the 131M/year Lebron brings to the downtown area... However, businesses saw an average yearly increase in revenue ranging from 30% to 200% depending on their size, much of this coming during the period of playoffs. Gilbert owns billions worth of businesses in the area, revenue of those businesses increased as a direct result of the increased spending.

4. The Clippers sold for $2B. Thanks, I get it. Lebron isn't responsible for ALL of the 1.2B valuation, but he does add to it. However, that has ZERO impact on the revenue he brings in from people who come to see him play, which is my main concern. No one travels to Cleveland because they heard the Clippers were sold. C'mon now.",0.88,top,7/21/17 5:04

And it's free, with no microtransactions or other gimmicks",17178,cgs1y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cgs1y7/i_made_basketball_gm_a_basketball_management/,845,1563914148,"I'm back again for my annual ""tell people about [Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/) during the dead of the NBA offseason"" post! First of all, if you've never played Basketball GM, [give it a try](https://basketball-gm.com/), I think you might like it. It's a video game where you get to be the general manager of a pro basketball team, kind of like Football Manager or franchise mode in 2k. You sign players, draft players, make trades, manage the finances, and try not to get fired.

Most importantly: it's free. Actually free. That means no microtransactions or ""free to play"" or any kind of horrible corrupting nonsense like that.

If you've played Basketball GM before... listen, I'm not gonna lie to you. At its core, it's the same game it was a year ago. If you didn't like it then, you probably won't like it now. But if you did like it before, it's even better now! There have been a ton of small improvements, such as:

* More customization options in God Mode. [Add/remove teams](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/cafqfp/in_god_mode_the_edit_team_info_page_has_been/), [don't allow your players to refuse to re-sign](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/bxcca8/new_in_v201906060088_a_god_mode_option_to_disable/), [edit relatives of players](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/btqh8w/more_minor_new_stuff_edit_relatives_when/), [use the new or old lottery odds](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2019/05/draft-lottery-updates/), [set hard/soft cap and playoff byes](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/11/new-options-hard-soft-cap-and-playoff-byes/), [edit playoff series lengths](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9i47ul/playoff_series_length_is_now_customizable/), and [load draft classes way into the future](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2019/07/far-future-draft-classes/).

* More depth, such as ways to view [family trees, tragic deaths, roster continuity, and the best players who never made the playoffs](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2019/05/frivolities/), [more realistic contracts and draft history in new leagues](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/11/more-realistic-new-leagues/), and [more](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2018/09/a-few-recent-minor-improvements/).

* A ton of UI improvements, like [""untouchable"" players and picks in trades](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9o9v7g/untouchable_players_and_picks_in_trades/), [dark mode](https://gfycat.com/distortedspottedcopepod), [play/pause/next buttons in live games](https://gfycat.com/idealcleveriberianmidwifetoad), [a sexy new playoffs UI](https://imgur.com/JCOkIai), [a ""Play > Until end of round"" menu item in the playoffs](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9e17bb/minor_new_feature_play_until_end_of_round_in_the/), and [a ""Download Spreadsheet"" button on nearly every table](https://np.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/9s8r8p/download_spreadsheet_button_on_nearly_every_table/).

I get to brag about my team once a decade, fuck off.)*

The Orlando Magic have come off the blocks hotter than a raccoon in a tin garbage can in the middle of June.  Whether it lasts will remain to be seen but as of right now they're knocking off heavyweights like the Cavs and Spurs like they're D-League teams and **bitch I am shook**.  We've been hot garbage ever since that tall ass pedophile dude left so ion even know what to do with myself right now.  Tried touching myself but I'm not gonna be able to get a nut off till we get that ring.  Blue ballin for the boys in blue.    

**THE TEAM**

We've got a scrappy squad of a bunch of young dick touchers coached by main man Frank the tank Vogel.  He's a cute guy for real.

**A-God** - This a real ass man right here.  He's young but he's got a big boy game now. Big dick shit only. Averaging 23 and 9 right now.  Please don't take him LA.  I swear to god.

**Vucci Mane** - This white boy right here is the truth.  We gotta make sure we get him in the racial draft next year before the race war.  Protect the Vooch

**The french dude** - I was low key mad when we traded away Dipo to give Fournier more minutes but imma take the L on that one cause my boy came through.  Also, Evan Fournier will fuck your girl.  And make you watch.  

*(Full disclosure:  I ate an edible like an hour and a half ago and that shit just hit me like a ton of bricks and I no longer have the energy to do the rest of the team.  You know the rest of them fools, just go with it)*


**THE CITY**

Orlando is mostly known as a vacation destination for people who think Olive Garden is fancy and Brazilian pickpockets.  Our two biggest celebrities of the past 10 years have been Casey Anthony and George Zimmerman.  [We are trash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6BKGpPIi58) and honestly North Korea should just nuke us.  We'd thank them.  

You ever wanted to go to a 2 story Sizzler?  You ever wanted to see a guy smoke crack in the middle of a highway?  Well this is your kinda place then.  We're close to Miami so we got pretty good drugs, but beyond that we're trash as hell.

Which is why the Magic not being trash is so vital to our life.  When you live in the **tackiest city in the country** you gotta do waht you gotta do.  Orlando is what most philosophers call a ""Garbage city"".  As in, its garbage, the people are garbage, there's garbage everywhere, crackheads will piss on your car, everyone is like 57% suicidal, just don't ever come here.

I know this is more of a prime off-season post, however I believe I should post this here:

In the summer of 2018, I was a manager at my local movie theater (Central Florida area). I was 20 years old at the time, and I’ve always been a major fan of sports associations such as the NFL and NBA. For more context, I would consider myself someone with above-average knowledge on topics NBA-related. Anyways, one morning I was opening the building, and the janitor turned in a lost wallet that was found from the previous night. This was no ordinary wallet, as it was a checkered Louis Vuitton design with engraved initials. I tried looking to see if there was any contact information from the wallet, and I immediately spotted his name (If I ever lost my wallet, I would like if the person who found it contacted me).  I still can’t believe that he lost his wallet at this random movie theater outside of Orlando, FL during the off-season (The odds of the person knowing who he is and finding his wallet are probably wild). Continuing on, I was shocked and immediately tried to find ways to contact him on social media. I tried contacting Harkless and his manager on multiple platforms, until I finally received a response on Instagram (Picture #1). After talking back and forth via direct messages, I ended up sending out the wallet to his address, including a small letter displaying how much of a fan I was (I’m a magic fan and supported him when he was on the team). After he received the package, it took several days for a response, however he replied by telling me next time the trail blazers come in town to play the Magic, he will hook me up with two tickets as well as post game passes. I was so excited and ecstatic for something like this because I’m a huge fan of the Magic and I love to watch the blazers! I told all my family and friends what happened, and my girlfriend and I called out of work for that day so we could enjoy ourselves. Long story short, he ghosted me, and I never got those tickets. (Picture #3-#5).

Let me preface by saying that I don’t mind that he didn’t send anything in return for sending back his wallet. What I do mind is that he promised me something that he never went through with. Both me and my girl called out of work for this and I was so excited to go to the game and see what the post-game passes were all about. I’m a fan and this was a genuine let-down for me.

I’m still a fan of Maurice Harkless, and I’m glad to see he’s on a championship contender this year, however I am still extremely disappointed and upset in how he completely lied to me/ghosted me once he got the wallet (that I paid priority shipping for). 

TL;DR – Found Moe Harkless’ wallet and sent it back to him in the mail. He promised me tickets and post-game passes, however once he received the wallet in the mail, he ghosted me.

EDIT #1 : I was very cringey and perhaps a bit excessive with my messages, however I don’t apologize for trying to get his attention. 

EDIT #2 : I can see if he reads a message, and all of those final messages weren’t read. The only reason I sent those messages were basically to bump up our conversation.

EDIT #3 : bro!

EDIT #4 : thanks to those of you that are kind, i appreciate it! Several people are attacking me for “expecting a return” when the only reason I’m expecting something in return is because he said he would reward me. I’ve returned plenty of lost items before without a reward, but anyone would be disappointed if they were promised something that they didn’t receive.",0.75,top,12/4/19 18:22

636,[OC] Westbrook can build a 1350 Sq. Ft. house with his bricks.,14729,cxi3hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cxi3hv/oc_westbrook_can_build_a_1350_sq_ft_house_with/,812,1567206022,"to start things off, A bricked shot by definition is typically any shot that bounces off the backboard or rim.  Unfortunately, there is currently no statistic for how a player misses, so I am counting all of his misses as bricks.

Over Westbrook's career, he has missed 8,627 shots during the regular season so if my math is correct, that gives us 8,627 bricks.

There are at least 10 different brick sizes, but we are going to go with a [standard modular brick - 7 5/8"" x 2 1/4"".](https://imgur.com/a/JH6X319) We are going to plan for 7 bricks per sq. ft.

With the house being 1,350 sq.ft., the perimeter of the house would be approximately 154 linear feet (27′ x 50′). Multiply that by a height of 8 feet to get a total square wall footage of 1,232.

At 7 bricks per sq. ft., you'll end up using 8,624 bricks out of the total 8,627.

Here are some nice brick homes in Houston around 1350 Sq. Ft. for reference:

Could this be solved by the Bucks changing their team name to the Milwaukee Talkies?,14532,6l22py,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6l22py/bucks_fans_claim_that_nba_fans_and_the_national/,465,1499138931,"I've been a huge supporter of this change for years, and I think now is the time to strike. The East is looking as weak as it has ever been and Giannis is starting to catch the eye of casual fans and the mainstream media alike. I believe now is the perfect time for Milwaukee to captivate sports fans across the Earth with a new name/identity that puts them at the forefront of the world of sports and entertainment. 

The name will not only attract young people who are always communicating on their social medias, but the geriatric crowd who will hear the name and reflect fondly on their youth where they would go to talking picture shows and do the Charleston before succumbing to the tuberculosis. Good times. 

Additionally, with jersey advertisements becoming an inevitability, the possibilities are endless for the Milwaukee Talkies. A cool cellular service like Jitterbug or Alltel, or a hip social media platform like Snapgram or Instaspace would both be fitting with the team name as well as appeal to the aforementioned youths/decrepits. Or they could go in a different direction and get an ad patch [appealing to the Latin American crowd](https://sep.yimg.com/ay/mex-grocer/takis-xplosion-cheese-and-chili-pepper-by-barcel-pack-of-3-3.gif)

Transcript of the text:

> Lou Williams: I didn't talk him out of killing me. Once he said what he said, I came up with a solution, but I didn't talk him out of it. Once he said what he said, I didn't tell him ""aye man, wait.” Story is, I was at the barbershop.....I get my hair cut in the hood. 22nd and Indiana in the hood. My security was with me at the barbershop. We leave the barbershop, I'm at the light. He called me and he said ""you good?” I said ""yea I'm straight.” He said ""alright good.” I watched him do a U turn behind me and pull off. I reached down and started playing with my phone sitting at the light. I look up and hear a knock at the window. I look up, dude got the gun. I don't know why I didn't get out the car......I should have got out the car, but instinctively I rolled the window down.........I rolled the window down and he told me to get out the car. We made eye contact and he said “Damn Lou, I can't even do it to you.' He just said 'Damn Lou, I can't even do it to you.' The next thing he said was 'man as much as you do for the city. As much as you do for the neighborhood, I can't even do you like that.' So what ended up happening is - in North Philly - again I am a dreamchaser. I've known Meek before the world knew Meek. When it was cold out, we would give out coats and sweaters. We did it out of pocket. Going to Burlington coat factory ourselves. Pulling up in Uhaul trucks and pulling stuff out......we used to do these things. Camps in the summertime. It was just a community that embraced me. This dude was from that community. He said ""I just got out of jail, I'm hurting. I'm hungry. All I got is this gun” So I look around and there's a McDonalds right there and I told him ""bro, if you pull in, lets go in and I'll buy you anything you want to eat.” It wasn't like he robbed me and then we got in the car. I just told him that I will buy him whatever. And that's what I did.....we sat there and chopped it up. He was just like ""I'm down and out out here."" I told him ""bro I get it, but this ain't the way.""

639,NBA 400 3-Pointer Challenge Completed in 2:45 w/Proof,14305,6swm2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6swm2g/nba_400_3pointer_challenge_completed_in_245_wproof/,1089,1502430194,"**I lived to tell the tale of 400 NBA 3’s!!**

A few days ago I saw the [400 NBA three pointer challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6rzyc6/youre_locked_in_a_gym_and_need_to_make_400_threes/). No food, no drink, just 400 made NBA threes or death. Something about the challenge spoke to me, so I decided to give it a go. I bought a GoPro camera and headed to the gym. 

I’m 42 and consider myself a good shot. I live next to a rec center and go shoot there once a month or so. I quit basketball after my sophomore year of high school and haven’t played 5 on 5 basketball in 20 years. I’ve never shot on a court with a NBA three point line. 

Without any food, drink, bathroom breaks, or leaving the frame of the camera (except for a few long rebounds), I finished the challenge in 2 hours 45 minutes. I shot almost exactly 50% (400 / 804). 

* [12 Minute Highlight Video with a few comments after each 100](https://youtu.be/F0qRdeOsYR8)

* [10 straight makes (shots 121 - 130)](https://youtu.be/xdobqrE1A3Q)

**Stats:**

* First 100 makes took 180 shots (55.56%)

* Second 100 took 167 shots (59.88%)

* Third 100 took 224 shots (44.64%)

* Fourth 100 took 233 shots (42.92%)

* Airballs: 2 (including my 3rd from last shot)

* Made streaks of 10,9,8,7,5,5,5,5,5
* Longest cold streak: 8
* Hottest Streak: Made 30/38 (79%) to start my second 100. 

It was hard. Kind of like running a half marathon hard. I was for sure thirsty, especially at the beginning before I settled in. I had a feeling the third 100 would suck, and it did. It was the “maybe I should quit” 100. Once you get past 300, you’re in it until the end. 

I have the entire event recorded and could put it all up on Youtube if there are any doubters. I pledge on my grandmother’s soul that I never left the gym, ate food, or had a drink. I took a 1-2 minute break each 100, where I talked to the camera for a moment. 

So, until proven otherwise by a well-documented attempt, I consider myself the world record holder in the NBA Subreddit 400. Two hours forty five.

641,Why Derrick Rose is the most overrated player of this Decade,12,acd3ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/acd3ek/why_derrick_rose_is_the_most_overrated_player_of/,142,1546595715,"Derrick Rose is famous for being the youngest MVP ever. Rose is also infamous for being extremely injury prone. 

Due to Rose's injuries he has gained lots of sympathy over the years. Most of it is deserved, he was an MVP level player whose career got ruined by injuries. 

Rose has always had a large fan base over the years, and because of his injury history, no one really talked negatively about him. (besides injury jokes) 

I have always believed Rose to be overrated, and for little good reason it has always made me annoyed and angry when people talk about him like he was going to be Michael Jordan if he didn't get injured. 

I have kept my stance to myself over the years, since there is no real need for me to bash on a player who hasn't been relevant or healthy for years. 

But this All-Star voting result has pushed me over the edge. 

I get it. It's a popularity contest. Dwayne Wade is #2 in the East, and Kobe Bryant was an all-star starter in a year he was awful. And Rose has been having a comeback season and it is impressive he is playing at a high level after what seemed like the end of his career. 

But I'm here to tell you that it's all good ole nostalgia that is blinding you from the fact that Rose wasn't as good as everyone makes him out to be. 

Let's look at Rose's MVP season, his stats were;
25 PPG, 7.7 APG, 4.1 RPG, 1 SPG, 0.6 BPG, 13.1 Win Shares. 

Since Rose's MVP season in 2010-2011, (last 8 years in the NBA, not including this year), there have been 18 other instances of players averaging a stat line of;
23+ PPG, 5+ APG, 4+ RPG, 13 Win Shares

Those players are;
Lebron (6), Harden (4), Curry (3), Durant (2), Westbrook (2), Butler (1) 

Out of those 19 instances (18 + Rose's MVP season), here are Rose's ranks in each of the following categories;

PPG: 15th
RPG: 19th
APG: Tied 7th 
Win Shares: Tied 18th
SPG: Tied 18th
BPG: Tied 8th
TPG: Tied 6th 
FG%: 15th
3P%: 16th
FT%: Tied 9th
TS%: 19th
PER: 19th
ORTG: 18th
DRTG: Tied 5th 
USG%: 7th 


My point is, Derrick Rose had one great year, which when compared to other MVP caliber players the past decade, wasn't even that great. 

I understand that he was young and had potential to get better, but he is put on a pedestal by some people that he doesn't deserve. 

Jimmy Butler's 2016-2017 year with the Bulls;
23.9 PPG, 5.5 APG, 6.2 RPG 1.9 SPG, 0.4 BPG, 13.8 Win Shares 
Is extremely similar to Rose's MVP season, and I would expect nothing but laughter if I were to ever compare the two in their prime. 

All stats according to Basketball Reference.

I understand this is a controversial topic that will get me a lot of hate, but please if you disagree with me, please try to be polite and present facts as to why I am wrong, instead of just calling me an idiot who knows nothing about basketball.

642,Kevin Durant is Overrated,0,vcrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/vcrct/kevin_durant_is_overrated/,170,1340263595,"I've honestly been thinking this the whole season when people were comparing him to Lebron and saying he deserves MVP, and he might be the better player between the two. Now seeing his effort and Stats throughout the finals I feel comfortable and I think some people will agree with me when I say this.

**ALL DURANT CAN DO EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IS SCORE** 

* Dude is almost 7 feet tall and averaging less then 6 rebounds per game. Last night he had 2 rebounds which is absolutely embarrassing. 

*  He has no court vision. Can't remember the last time I've been amazed by a pass he's thrown, most of his assists come from a jumpshot made by a team mate who happens to be open. He is averaging less then 2 assists for the finals 

* He usually gives a half ass effort trying to get open when a play is drawn for him. I've seen wade who is much shorter then him body him into a terrible position many times. Since Durant can't manage to get open its usually westbrook who has to jack up a terrible shot.

* It has been exposed that Durant is a below average defender. His Mistakes just get erased because he has Serge and Perkins lurking in the paint to stop drives and block shots. Melo is usually called out for his defense but Durant's is worse. I've never seen Melo have to be switched off a man.

I think people who have watched the NBA back in the day will agree when I say that Durant is a watered down prime T-Mac.

Edit: So none of you have actually tried to counter my points and went on about how he's young, and can score and all that. Derrick Rose, Dwight, Rondo, Kevin Love, Westbrook, Griffin etc, are all young and can score. But they bring more to the table then just that. Which is my point. You cant be a top 3 player if all you can do well is score.",0.49,controversial,6/21/12 0:26
643,When does D Rose's free pass expire?,24,1b4dj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1b4dj9/when_does_d_roses_free_pass_expire/,356,1364434341,"Admittedly, I'm entering this with bias as have always thought he was overrated, but I'd like to know the board's thoughts (especially Bulls fans). He's officially out vs ""El Heat"" tonight so no miraculous return to try and stop the streak and send a pre-playoff message. When does the gushing praise and love for this guy stop?

He's not a great shooter, but he shoots all the time. I bet there's 10-15 guys in the league you could put in his spot and give them the same freedom and ball dominance that could put up similar stats. That's not a superstar, that's a ballhog with handles.

He would not help the Bulls recruit any big free agents 2 summers ago

He was completely shut down by Lebron in the playoffs (as most would be in all fairness) but showed he could not adjust his game

Hasn't won anything of note

Doctors cleared him WEEKS ago. Could you imagine telling your boss you're not going to work even though the doctor said you're not sick anymore? What do you think would happen?

Not that it's game related, but Adidas spent a pretty penny pushing #thereturn, which was clearly just throwing a bunch of cash in the trashcan as there will not be a return.

His teammates play like warriors and give up their bodies and risk injury every night. Every athlete does. Kobe blew the ankle and at least TRIED before coming out of the game. He's supposedly practicing full speed, I'd be pissed if I was his teammate. 

Those same teammates are going to have the Bulls with a very respectable record and in the playoffs without him. Take any other MVP candidate off their team and tell me if you get a similar result (excluding the Heat).

And my all-time favorite: 'the all-star game is not a place for smiling and dancing'. Dude, get over yourself. I know this one has nothing to do with the actual game, but it really made me dislike him. 

When does he stop getting showered with praise without actually doing anything?",0.52,controversial,3/27/13 18:32

645,When is the NBA going to start calling offensive fouls on Andrew Bogut??,130,33qbkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/33qbkl/when_is_the_nba_going_to_start_calling_offensive/,343,1429924169,"The Warriors are practically unwatchable for me.  Almost every single play Bogut sets a screen where he is obviously moving.  It's gotten so rdiculous that he straight up bear hugged Anthony Davis and then, the very next play, grabbed Omer Asik's jersey to the point where it stretch out like a flag.  Both players were in correct defensive position and were so blatantly hindered from making their rotation by Bogut.  Those plays led to an And 1 and a dunk.

I don't expect players to play it clean every play or for refs to catch them every time, but this isn't ""heady basketball,"" or ""using an advantage.""  Those are used when a player gets away with something once a game.  Bogut does stuff like this the majority of the time he is out there.  What he is doing is straight up illegal, and it's ruining the games when the refs don't call it.

The moving screen is impossible to defend because it turns a passive obstacle into an active one.  NBA players are hard enough to defend with somebody acting as an offensive linemen, taking multiple steps to try and hinder your progress.  Holding is even worse, for obvious reasons.  And watching the Warriors, Bogut gets away with this stuff probably 10-20 times a game.

I don't see any possible way that NBA refs can be so consistently bad at calling this stuff.  Something else is happening, because they are definitely turning a blind eye.  An official was looking right at the Bogut/Davis bearhug, called nothing, AD threw a fit (as he should), and 24 second later they ignored another blatant hold.

This isn't an argument that the Pelicans deserved to win, and I'm not a fan of either team, so I have no dog in this fight.  I want to watch good, playoff, basketball.  When I see one of the easiest calls in the game botched over and over and over again, and there's only one perpetrator, it absolutely takes away the entire viewing experience.  I feel cheated that I put a ton of time and money into being a fan this year, and now the league appears to letting a player foul at will without fear of being called for it.

This is ridiculous.  Watch one of Steph's highlight videos, you're bound to see at least 5-6 blatant offensive fouls by Bogut.  If he was doing it every now and again, I'd shrug my shoulders because stuff like that happens.  But, he's doing it consistently.  Game in, game out.  His fouls have to be accounting for significant swings in scoring, as they often lead to baskets (why they're illegal in the first place).  And NBA refs are doing nothing.  I refuse to believe in an NBA that called more offensive fouls on AD than Bogut got in the entire game.  I really don't fault Bogut all that much either.  If they're letting him play like that, he's be a numbskull not to exploit it.

Shameless.  This reeks of WWE and kingmaking by the league.  Different commissioner, same shady shit.  The NBA obviously cares more about profits than the integrity of the game, which is pathetic.

Start calling offensive fouls on Bogut.  The Warriors are good enough with their talent to possibly win a title alone.",0.56,controversial,4/24/15 18:09

*In a times of vibrant globalization of NBA, with China being its biggest partner (overseas), the public outburst and conflicts on this issue have grown explosively. The NBA however is making a superficial, ambiguous statement, trying to convert a political discussion into a cultural one.* 

*It's no surprise.*

*I never expected the NBA to issue any fines on Morey, nor will Rockets fire him even if the owner wanted to.* 

*Obviously in this issue, politics position outweighs right or wrong. For China, we have our bottom line (in diplomatic matters related to Hong Kong), while the US has its own political correctness. As the ""candle-stick"" country (this is an interesting reference to US, not sure if the context is clear. Basically it refers to the Book of Mathew in Bible and teases US for its propaganda of western values), the US has its mainstream values and always tries to measure other nation's reality with their own culture and beliefs.* 

*Look at Reddit (yup the author has VPN, as does many others netizens): considerable of American netizens voice support for Morey, just because he advocates ""democracy"" for ""people"", but without realizing Morey offended our sovereignty greatly. They think he just voices an opinion of his and what's wrong with that?*

*In reality, this so-called freedom has evolved into violence. The long-term living conditions of the ""people"" they support, the US doesn't care to understand and this is their arrogance (he's arguing that some American folks just follow the trend without really understand the issue of HK).*

*Thus, it's not hard to understand the attitude of NBA.*

*In US, as long as the bottom line of racial and sexual discrimination is not touched, it's illegal to fine people on their words because of freedom of speech. The NBA in recent years has also been encouraging their stars to comment on progressive affairs, in order to boast its own social and political value. They won't contradict themselves by punishing Morey.*

*If NBA criticizes Morey or Fertitta fires him, this will cause the public opinion to say that ""they chose money over freedom"" or ""does the NBA have the right to take away its employees' opinions?"" Granted they might fear the loss of Chinese market, but the American market is the fundamentals of NBA. It goes without saying which one is prioritized. Thus, Fertitta's saying ""We have the best GM in the league"" (This was taken out of context; I think it was wording before a turn of tone but it's taken as defense for Morey) is not because he ignores the seriousness of the issue, but it's the inevitable development of events.*

*So what's our take on this? I personally think we should stand with what the leadership decides to take.*

*If the state does not ban NBA, it's also not necessary for us to keep bashing (Morey and NBA). Only the uncultured and the boorish shout “perish together” to their end. The NBA is very closely knitted with China's sports industry, be it forums, media, reporters or sports company. Many count on NBA as their income.* 

*I've said this in a group chat, a nation has to protect its sovereignty to develop, but it doesn't mean pushing it too hard.* 

*I don't have the relevant numbers and stats for the sports industry, and don't have a think tank to report on cost-benefit analysis. But I trust that after a full day's silence, the State has a more accurate estimate of developments on this matter, and has planned accordingly. Whether it's forgiving concession or a heavy punch to the NBA, we shall wait and see.*

*Another way to understand this is by thinking in their shoes: if you partner with US but sends a tweet that insults African American, and try to say that ""my country has freedom of speech, and my views do not represent my company"", this most definitely won't be accepted by Americans.*

*At the end of this, one has to contemplate: under David Stern, the Houston Rockets became the barometer and milestone of NBA's Chinese market. This was why the issue was so destructive. Also, if it happened during a less subtle time (China's National Day is Oct 1st), or on a less sensitive topic (sovereignty), or a less important person (GM of the most popular NBA team in China), this matter wound't have expanded like this.*

*Perhaps, the biggest victim in this incident are the Chinese fans who devoted their love to Rockets and NBA.* 

""""""

Tl;dr: Explains why the NBA releases an ambiguous statement since it's bound by western values but still values Chinese market. Provides context of Western universal values and how it clashes with China's sovereignty issues. Points out that ban of NBA harms both sides. Explains why this particular issue exploded so dramatically.

My thoughts: 

1) The author clearly understands a fair amount of American cultural contexts, and explains on the issue from both nations' cultural and political beliefs. It‘s actually a good education for the Chinese public on why the NBA/Rockets/American fans react in their ways. Hopefully this brings more meaningful conversations on this Chinese forum.

2) Has a very good point: China doesn't want to just permanently cut ties because of conflict since China's sports industry also suffers damage if the NBA doesn't flourish in the country.

3) Ultimately I see two clashing fundamental beliefs on the topic freedom of speech. In Western values you can say anything about politics as long as it doesn't touch racial or sexual discrimination. In China, it's deemed the freedom of speech does not protect speech that ""undermines national sovereignty"". The rest of world knows how China is ""petty"" on issues like this, but they might not understand is that China and its netizens treats its sovereignty issues just as seriously as the west treats racial issues. Territorial integrity is its fundamental value and is indoctrinated from grade school, just as racial equality is taught in US educational system. And it's a very successful strategy: *not everyone* agrees with the government's ways, but *everyone* gets fired up on territorial issues. Most Chinese fans genuinely  think it's a double standard to not allow someone criticize a specific race, but supporting ""separatist movement"" is allowed. 
But that's what freedom of speech is, a western person might say. This is why this clash of ideas is so fundamental.

4) In his last sentence, you can tell he really believes the Chinese fans are heart-broken by this issue, despite their angry reactions. And in a way it's true. The NBA has been a progressive, positive influence in China, and even educates the public on matters like racial equality. Fans really treat their franchise players as inspiring role models, and devote lots of emotions into the team. And now out of nowhere Morey posted this comment that's deemed outrageous in the country, and both fanbase despise each other in heated argument, with possibility of NBA being banned. There's definitely emotional loss there. 

For me, the NBA and the Rockets have been great ambassadors (like it or not) in modern China-US relationship due to the influence. It's sad to see them entangled in this position.

Not arguing for any side through this post; meant to share this for some insights. Please correct me on anything that I got wrong. Note: this Zhihu response was obviously written before China goes all in and announces suspension of NBA broadcast, while the OP predicted a less aggressive reaction from the leadership. I can make an update on newest fans sentiment, if anyone is interested.",0.53,controversial,10/8/19 13:50
647,"There is no such thing as a ""clutch"" player...",7,asceds,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/asceds/there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_clutch_player/,222,1550623555,"After you're done being upset at the audacity I must have to make such a claim take the time to do a little research, as well as look at the data for yourself.  Clutch moments exist, hitting a game winning shot is in fact clutch.  But clutch players do not - just good / great ones who we mistake their greatness for clutchness.  

&#x200B;

The science suggests that these events are overrated in our memory because there are so few of them and the stakes are much higher that the results from these events stick with us longer and remain more meaningful to our perception.  But that's just a human limitation - not anything real.  Hitting a big shot in a big moment is more of a product of randomness than anything.  With such small sample sizes nothing meaningful can be truly derived from the data, especially without the full picture (i.e. the context behind each attempt).  When these samples grow the picture becomes clearer - the best players tend to perform the best no matter the situation. 

&#x200B;

With all that said I'll leave this data here...a players TS% during ""clutch"" moments from one year to the next (2010-2019).  If clutch were real, wouldn't it be repeatable?  

&#x200B;

  


[Source:  NBA .com](https://preview.redd.it/nn49ozyazjh21.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=912cff6f0fddb511cea76d695b719bc7c57cffc6)

&#x200B;

Each quadrant is split almost 25 / 25 / 25 / 25.  That's pretty remarkable and telling of pure randomness.  Out of the 204 players that are included at least 3x in the data, just 13 (about 6%) were above average each year.  They're exactly who you would consider clutch too - Steph Curry, Steve Nash, Al Horford, Ray Allen, Gordon Hayward, Samuel Dalembert, Amir Johnson, Julius Randle, Kyle Korver, Dwight Howard, Tyson Chandler, Derrick Favors, and Markieff Morris.  A veritable who's who of the most clutch players in the game.  Or, in all actuality, guys who have limited years (who will eventually fall victim to the random output of ""clutch"" time statistics) or players who were still incredibly inconsistent but are so GD good at shooting that it's hard for them to fall below average (Steph, anyone?).  

&#x200B;

The point is, clutch players don't really exist.  If they did, they could do it over and over and over and we would find it in the data - but it's not there.  I know that many sports fans treasure the idea of players being clutch, so it's hard to admit reality when you don't want to.  But that doesn't make it any less true.  Sorry.

648,Debunking narratives about the Warriors-Rockets 2018 Western Conference finals,117,g7tgd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g7tgd9/debunking_narratives_about_the_warriorsrockets/,306,1587849830,"Disclaimer:I am a Knicks fan not a Warriors fan not a Rockets fan I never was a blind hatrer towards Stephen Curry or James Harden and appreciate their greatness, Klay Thompson and PJ Tucker are some of my favorite players as well. Full disclosure I watched every single game and wanted the Rockets to win the series so if that disqualifies me from being what I consider a non-bias observer I’ll take the L. 

To some people narratives are more important than what actually happened. You make a comment you think is noncontroversial next thing you know you have -50 downvotes because it went against a popular narrative. With how some people in the NBA media and Reddit talk about certain events it’s like they didn’t even watch the same game as you. The 2017-18 Rockets had an historic offense and one of the better defenses in the league. They didn’t have the star power Golden State had but they had the right pieces around 2 all NBA caliber players. I’m going to quote some of the popular narratives against this team and attempt to debunk them.

#”Rockets went 0-27 they deserve to lose”

Point 1: even going 0-27 the game was within 6 points with five minutes left in the fourth quarter until Steve Kerr did Hack-a-Capella and the game got out of hand.

Point 2: Why did they shoot so many threes despite them not falling? Because the refereeing, I am NOT arguing if the refs are bias I am trying to stick to only the facts. You can argue with whether bad calls are part of the game and they happen all the time it’s a physical game. What you cannot argue is that refereeing does not affect the outcome of the game. The Rockets were not getting many calls in their favor game 7. The warriors were very physical in the paint this made the Rockets three point shots or attack the basket strategy harder because the Warriors were getting away with contact. That’s what led to the decision of shooting so many threes. Personally I wish James Harden was unleashed and had the green light to shoot mid range shots this game, he used to be elite at it when he took them, and the Warriors defense wouldn’t have game planned around it but this is hindsight. In the moment you probably don’t wanna deviate from what got you there. Also there was a four Point play in the third quarter that was waived off Harden MADE a 3.

Minor point:[There was 4 three point fouls](https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU) on James Harden that game that was missed and if the fouls were called those attempts wouldn’t have counted. I cannot recall if it happened to any other player but I vividly remember it happening to Harden. Missed fouls are a part of the game yes but if there’s a nuanced for that why can’t there be nuanced for 0-27.

#“yeah Chris Paul was injured games seven but Andre Iguodala was injured too. If Andre Iguodala  was healthy it wouldn’t have gone seven”

Point 1: Andre Iguodala was vital to the Warriors One of the best six men in the league at the time and could’ve helped guard Harden yes. However it is absolutely idiotic to compare all star and all NBA caliber player Chris Paul 1 of the best point guards in history and one of the smartest to a 6th man. Chris Paul was the 2nd most important player to the Rockets at best Andre Iguodala 5th most important. But OK let me debunk this one by comparing how each team performed without each player. 

Warriors Playoffs offensive rating when Andre Iguodala is in the game:111.9 

Warriors Playoffs defensive Rating when Andre Iguodala is in the game:98.5

Warriors Offensive rating games 3-7 no Iggy: 109.725(-2.185)

Warriors Defensive rating games 3–7 no Iggy: 101.5(+? 3)

Rockets Playoffs Offensive rating when Cp3 is in the game 109.1

Rockets Playoffs defensive Rating when CP3 is in the  game:102.3

Rockets offensive rating game 6-7 without Chris Paul 96.85(-13.85)

Rockets Defensive rating game 6-7 without Chris Paul 117.15(+?14.85) 

The Warriors without Andre Iguodala were 2.185 points worse without him offensively and 3 points worse defensively. Compare that to the Rockets without Chris Paul 13.85 points worse offensively and 14.85 points worse defensively. It’s laughable to compare the impact of Andre Iguodala to the impact of Chris Paul which leads me to my next point.

Point 2: Why do people pretend like CP3 and Iggy were the only injured players that series? Luc Richard Mbah a Moute unfortunately got injured right before the playoffs and it was never the same. He played some games in the playoffs but it was a shell of himself and because of that it forced the Rockets to play Ryan Anderson. According to advance stats he was the Rockets best defender out of all rotation players who got serious minutes. He and Trevor Ariza had similar importance to the Rockets and he played a vital role in their defense.  Let’s compare all of the injured players stats. Unlike Andre Iguodala and Chris Paul, whose stats were better in the playoffs then in the regular season, I will be using regular season stats for LMaM because injury.

Luc Richard Mbah a Moute Regular season stats:
7.5/3/.9/1.2/.3 on 48.1/36.4/68.4 Win shares 2.8 defensive win shares 2.1 usage 12.8% defensive rating 101.7 and offensive rating 111.4 25.6 minutes a game.

Andre Iguodala playoff stats: 8.1/4.5/2.7/1.4/.5 on 49.4/37.8/70.6 spilts Win shares 1.4 Defensive win shares .7 usage rate of 12.4% defensive Rating of 98.5 and offensive rating of 111.9 26.7 minutes a game.

Chris Paul Playoff stats: 21.1/5.9/5.8/2/.3 WS 2.1 DWS .7 on 45.9/37.4/83 Usage rate 26.2% Offensive rating 109.1 and Defensive Rating 102.3 34.5 minutes game.

According to the stats Andre Iguodala impact was more closer to Luc Richard Mbah they played a similar amount of minutes had a similar usage rate and offensive rating. Iguodala has a better defense of rating and better stats but LMaM had more win shares. Meaning the Rockets lost their second best player and a player who had similar production to Iggy. It’s completely ridiculous to say injuries are awash in the series.

#“The Rockets blew a 3-2 lead Harden is a choker and he can’t lead his team to a championship”

The 2018 Warriors are one of the greatest NBA teams in history that had four All-Stars(Draymonds last year). 2 of the greatest shooters of all time one of which was a top 5 player and 2xMVP with another pretty good shooter who was 7 feet tall and a top 5 MVP player. The Rockets had 1 MVP top 5 player James Harden A 6 man of the year and a bunch of role players(2 of which I’d argue cost them game 7 Ryan Anderson and Clint Capela with FT). It would be ridiculous to think that they could have beaten one of the greatest teams of all time and the craziest thing is they almost did. Let’s only take into account the 4 3 point fouls [that in the moment even the announcers thought were missed fouls](https://youtu.be/aYveyAb6mvU). Including a four-point play that was waived off. Harden is a 88.7% FT shooter so let’s say that’s a possible 11-12/13 extra points the Rockets get final score could’ve been 101-103/4 and that’s not even factoring in points the Warriors lost from fast break opportunities from fouls not being called(IE Klay’s 3 after a miss foul on harden) or game momentum possibly shifting. I’m not arguing if the refs are biased I’m arguing the facts there were missed calls and it cost the Rockets the game. 

Point 2: if the Rockets beat the Warriors which they very much could’ve they are 100% washing the Cavs. The Cavs defense was horrible and it was arguably one of the worst teams ever to make the finals if it wasn’t for LeBron. I’m pretty sure even though Harden hasn’t won a championship you can say he is a caliber player to get you one, he wasn’t just one game away he was a few calls away.

#“Kevin Durant was hurt last year he has no excuses and it proves the Rockets we’re never going to be able to beat the Warriors they need to stop saying if CP3 didn’t get hurt”

I remember hearing that one from Rachel Nichols 

Point 1: Here is the facts you can have the same core and be a worse team. Teams are not stagnant players become better players become worse. Rockets lost Trevor Ariza and LMaM, NeNe was old as hell last year, Chris Paul had a down year, Eric Gordon might have declined, Capela played worse last year. As a result of The Rockets personnel downgrade their switch everything strategy didn’t work and their defense was so much worse than the year before. You also had a owner who was unwilling to improve the team by going into luxury tax. 

Point 2: If it wasn’t for James Harden doing something incredible by going on a rampage and caring his team I doubt the Rockets would have even been in a game 6 against the Warriors. If James harden just replicated his production from his MVP season You could argue that Rockets team doesn’t even make the playoffs with all the injuries and downgrades. I am not trying to disparage LeBron for this next point, I just want to highlight how insane Harden went. Harden did something LeBron couldn’t do that year take a injured team in the west that year to the playoffs Harden elevated the Rockets from the 14th Seed into top 4(if it wasn’t for the nuggets would’ve been 3 1 game from 2)while recovering from an injury. Harden having a historic season included  having the second most steals that season with the most deflections, while averaging the most points since MJ (36)with a 32 game streak of 30+ points. including moments like the game against the Warriors with no CP3 where he hit a clutch three point shot to win the game against Draymond and Klay. Going 21-11 despite Chris Paul and Clint Capela missing time during that stretch season as well. One of the greatest performances I’ve ever seen in a regular season and it completely masked a lot of the Rockets flaws.

Point 3: Now more specifically games 6 You had Andre Iguodala score 17 points on 62.5% from 3 game 6 Klay and Steph going god mode in the second half. Steph scored 33 points 25 in the fourth quarter. Sometimes there is nothing you can do and the better team wins it and the warriors were the better team this year. If it wasn’t for Klay’s injury they could’ve beaten the Raptors and won a championship without Kevin Durant. They were a championship caliber team with or without Kevin Durant there is no shaming and losing to them.

Bonus narratives not related to this series specifically but I’m not making another post for these and might as well address them 

###“Harden sucks at defense”

He is one of the best post defenders in the league was top 5 in steals twice at the very least he’s average to above average.

People don’t seem to take my word for it and they shouldn’t I should’ve elaborated but I got lazy toward the end 

These stats are accurate from March 16, 2019 I am still looking for the end of year stats from 2019

Pts per possession: 1st

FG%: 2nd

eFG% 2nd

Turnover frequency: 1st

Scoring frequency: 1st

This is from this year

[Harden has allowed just 0.65 points per post-up in 2019-20, the second-best mark of 50 players with at least 50 post possessions defended. ](https://www.si.com/nba/rockets/features/grading-james-harden-defensive-performance) He's also been an effective pick-and-roll defender. Harden allows just 0.78 points when defending the ball-handler in a PnR, ranking 31st of the 164 qualified players. Houston often schemes Harden away from the league's top guards, but that caveat doesn't dismiss the metrics. Harden has been an effective defender for significant stretches this season.

###“Harden chokes all the time”

I am not going to pretend Harden does not have bad playoff games he does he has historically bad games at times and has chocked. but all the time? what is choking? If Having a bad game equals choking did Steph Curry choke in game 3 in the 2018 finals? I’d argue no bad games come and go you should look at the totality of the series/playoffs. Some people say Harden choked in the playoffs last year. Harden averaged 34.83/7/5.5/2.16/.5 against the Warriors I don’t know what else he could’ve done that series. Did he have a few turnovers? yeah but if you think a few turnovers was the reason the Rockets lost to the Warriors not the fact that they were inferior team and “harden choked” I don’t know what to say to convince you otherwise. The last time he chocked was game 6 against San Antonio (i’ve heard arguments that he had a concussion but since we don’t have any medical evidence we have to assume it was a choke).",0.57,controversial,4/25/20 14:23
649,Unpopular Opinion: I don't like Tim Duncan,36,4sl13t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4sl13t/unpopular_opinion_i_dont_like_tim_duncan/,119,1468408685,"Title says it all. 

1. I hate that he whines after every call that either (a) doesn't go his way; or (b) goes against him. Especially the face he makes when whining about those calls. 

2. I've always thought he was a boring player (perhaps that's more indicative of the Spurs system from 1999-2011 or so, but I still blame Tim Duncan). Given his boring play, I've never said ""I can't wait to watch Tim Duncan tonight."" Yet even though I dislike other players, such as Lebron, I'm damn sure tuning in to watch him play. 

3. I've always felt like he was incredibly lucky with the situation he was in. For example, if the Spurs had traded their first pick in 1997 (which was used to draft Tim Duncan) for Kevin Garnett, I do not think Tim Duncan becomes ""Tim Duncan."" Given his quiet nature, I doubt his ability to single-handedly carry a franchise like Garnett did in Minnesota. Meanwhile, if Garnett is surrounded by the talent Duncan was during the 2000's, he wins multiple MVP's and more championships than Duncan during that era. 

4. He is friends with Bruce Bowen.

5. While I believe that he is probably more humble than the average NBA player, I think he received the ""humble"" label predominately because of his boring on-court play and the fact that the Spurs, despite winning, were rarely given national attention during the 2000's because they were so boring to watch. Had he played in a major media market, ala Kobe, Iverson, etc., he would likely have received more media scrutiny. With more scrutiny, he might act out in ways that we wouldn't expect (like Durant when he began to receive more media pressure). 

That's all I can think of. Maybe I'm irrational, but although I respect his accomplishments and think he was an excellent player, I'm just not a fan of Tim Duncan. Does that make me a bad person? Am I going to hell?",0.54,controversial,7/13/16 4:18
650,Reminder: Why Lebron's Supporting Cast Being Bad Is His Fault,207,8lvmpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8lvmpl/reminder_why_lebrons_supporting_cast_being_bad_is/,245,1527220551,"I was reading this r/nba thread today (1) and I saw everyone excusing Lebron this season stating how ""he can't be wasting his last years of greatness carrying a s*** team"" or ""Lebron would be a fool to stay in Cleveland and waste his prime years on such a s*** team.""

Well, I'm sorry to say, but this ""s*** team"" is Lebron's fault.

After the 2015 NBA Finals, Lebron used his leverage against the front office to re-sign Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson. Iman Shumpert signed for 4 years/40 million (!) dollars. Tristan Thompson was re-signed by the Cavs for 5 years/82 million (!) dollars. This contract is especially crazy because the Cavs were essentially competing against no other teams to sign Thompson. According to this CBS Sports article (2), not a single team stepped forward with a max offer sheet for Thompson to use as leverage in negotiations. Lebron took away all of his GM’s negotiating ability and it resulted in more than 290 million dollars in guaranteed money being handed out that offseason (3). This happened again in the 2016 NBA offseason when Lebron used his leverage once again to give out a 4 year/57 million (!) dollar contract to J.R. Smith. Lebron James has a penchant for getting his teammates exorbitant sums of money with no regard for his team’s future salary cap situation.

Sure, these contracts worked in the short term as the Cavs won the 2016 NBA championship but these contracts are rearing their ugly heads now and have resulted in this “s*** team” around Lebron.

According to Brian Windhorst while appearing on the Lowe Post, Lebron was especially bothered by the Cavs not trading for either Paul George or Eric Bledsoe this past offseason (4). As tempting as it is taking on either Tristan Thompson making 16.4 million dollars this season or J.R. Smith making 13.8 million dollars, both the Suns and the Pacers made the right decision and passed. Lebron cannot be mad at the Cavs front office because he was the one that hampered them in the first place. There was no way the Cavs were going to put the best offer on the table for either player due to Lebron’s own front office decisions.

We can even go back to Lebron’s heat days where he urged the Heat to trade up to draft Shabazz Napier (5). Now, Napier has played well for the Trail Blazers in their 3 guard lineup but his Heat tenure was very disappointing. Shabazz averaged 19.8 minutes while playing for the Heat with 5.1 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per contest. He was traded to the Magic after one season for a 2016 second-round pick. I hate doing this but if you look back at the 2014 NBA draft, the very next person to go was Clint Capela with Bogdan Bogdanovic and Kyle Anderson following soon after. Lebron struck again by acting as the GM and ended up wasting a first round pick on a player the Heat had no use for. 

Lebron is no doubt going to go down as one of the greatest players to ever play the game but should go down as one of the worst GM’s as well. This “s*** team” is the result of Lebron’s own short sighted GM moves. 

TL;DR: Lebron should never again partake in front office decisions because nearly every front office decision he has impacted has turned out poorly. This is especially seen with this current inferior Cavs supporting cast since the front office was in a bind against the salary cap due to Lebron influenced decisions from years ago.

###The [first foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=41) was called by Ken Mauer at 6:12 first quarter (5:48 into the game).

Paul George tries to split Bosh and LeBron and is tripped. When I watch the video it looks like LeBron’s left knee catches George’s left leg as LeBron swivels. We would need an angle from the endline to say for sure.

###The [second foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=64) was called by Ken Mauer at 2:43 first quarter (3:29 later).

This is the type of foul that is hard to understand by fans. The key here is that LeBron never established Legal Guarding Position, or LGP. The rules define certain things that must take place in order to *establish* Legal Guarding Position (in the path of offensive player, getting to the spot first, getting to the spot without contact to an opponent), certain things that the defender *can* do once they have LGP (move laterally or obliquely, move the feet, have feet off ground, etc), and certain things that causes the defender to *lose* LGP (moving forward, leaving the path of the offensive player, etc).

In this case **LeBron never established initial Legal Guarding Position**. He  was never in Hill's path before Hill started upward motion to shoot or pass.

When a player does not have Legal Guarding Position, **the amount of contact does not matter**. All the referee needs to decide is 1) if the player had legal position, and 2) if not, did the contact disadvantage the offensive player. The referee decided this contact disadvantaged Hill, and thus cannot be incidental or marginal contact. *I think we need an endline angle on this play as well.

Check out my other posts on Legal Guarding Position where I go into much more depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1wcbfw/durant_and1/cf0s6ym), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1yo65t/duke_defeats_syracuse_6660_in_cameron/cfmp3qw), and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1yo65t/duke_defeats_syracuse_6660_in_cameron/cfmoqdw).

###The [third foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=152) was called by Ed Malloy at 6:03 second quarter (8:40 later).

This is also a Legal guarding Position play. If Paul George *has* established position (got to the spot) before LeBron contacts him, it is a charge. If PG *has not* established position before LeBron gets there, it is a blocking foul.

It is important to understand that the way LGP is applied changes depending on the type of play. On a shot or pass attempt, LGP needs to be established before the offensive player begins his upward motion to shoot or pass. **On a dribbling play like this, the upward motion clause is not in play**, which allows Paul George to quickly get to the spot and establish LGP before LeBron charges into him. Here is the case play:

NBA Case Play 29

*Player A1 is dribbling the ball and Player B1 jumps into his path. What is the deciding point between block or charge?*

A dribbler is expected to be in control at all times and if a defender can legally get to a ‘spot’ in the path of the dribbler, **it is the dribbler’s responsibility to stop and/or change direction** immediately. However, if a defender cannot completely get his torso in his path without making contact, a blocking foul should be called.

###The [fourth foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=220) was called by Tom Washington at 11:39 second quarter (6:24 later).

Foul. LeBron clearly hits Hibbert’s arm. No discussion necessary.

###The [fifth foul](http://stats.nba.com/cvp.html?GameID=0041300305&GameEventID=248) was called by Ed Malloy at 8:34 third quarter (3:05 later).

I watched this play probably 30 times. Stephenson is fouled four times on this play, three times by LeBron. The first foul is an illegal screen by Rashard Lewis (moving forward into Lance at point of contact, also lowers shoulder *outside his frame*).

After Lance hits the ball out (clean), he tries to go around LeBron to the right, but LeBron puts out his right arm, which contacts Lance in the neck (foul). Lance responds by putting his arms around LeBron and tries to pull him out of the way (foul). LeBron then puts both arms behind him, still trying to prevent Lance from getting around him (foul). Then, when Lance dives for the ball, LeBron runs into Lance’s hip causing Lance to slip and hit the floor (foul).

This is a tough play. In this case the referee needs to be looking for either 1) the first foul, or 2) who disadvantages who more. Both players fouled each other, that is clear. But the NBA is a physical game, and when both players have an opportunity to get a loose ball *some* of this type of contact is allowed. In this case **LeBron fouls Stephenson just as Stephenson is about to get the ball**.

As you can see above, the rumor that Ed Malloy called all five fouls is bullshit.

652,[OC] Draft picks aren't worth nearly as much as you think they are : the expected return of a no1 overall pick is … Matt Barnes,71,bpbj9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bpbj9f/oc_draft_picks_arent_worth_nearly_as_much_as_you/,155,1558036029,"I think there's a massive gap between the perceived value of a draft pick, and it's actually value as far as contributing wins to the franchise that gets it.

This has a couple of results : 

1. Teams, media and fans all give picks far more value than they're actually worth in trades involving players

2. It puts an unreasonably high expectation on all top draft picks, who are all expected to be studs, when statistically, simply being a good starter means they're probably above average

3. It puts unreasonably high expectations on front offices, who are seen as failures if they didn’t get the best player available with their pick, when statistically, it’s almost impossible to get it right, outside of maybe no1 overall.

So I wanted to compile the average and median values of each 1st and 2nd round pick in the draft since 1985 (beginning of the lottery) to 2016 (2017 and 2018 draftees just haven't been in the league long enough), using the two most recognised publicly available cumulative advanced stats : Win Shares (WS) and Value Over Replacement Player (VORP). Neither of which are perfect, but they give a bit of an idea.

(Note : even stopping the range at the 2010 draft, the median results aren’t really changed in any significant manner).

I'm using both median and average, but the median is probably far more representative. Since these are cumulative stats, the worst outliers don't stay in the league long enough to accumulate massively negative totals, whereas the best outliers can rack up WS/VORP for 20 years. Median is far less susceptible to outliers, so **pay attention to the median column more than the average.**

A few notes :

- There's a monumental gap between the value of the no1 pick and the next most valuable pick (3rd, surprisingly).

- There's an almost inexplicable dip after the 5th pick, by both metrics, which then rebounds with the 9th and 10th picks. 

Here's an example of a couple of retired players whose career VORP and WS are roughly equal to the median value of each top-10 pick

|Pick|Players approaching median value (VORP)|Players approaching median value (WS)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Antawn Jamison, Rick Fox, Matt Barnes|John Starks, Kenyon Martin, Theo Ratliff|
|2|Brendan Haywood, Andris Biedrins|Sam Mitchell, Dell Curry, Keith Van Horn|
|3|Jerry Stackhouse, Jamal Mashburn|Raef LaFrentz, Chris Andersen, Mo Williams|

|9|Phil Jackson, Joel Przybilla, Scott Skiles|Beno Udrih, Travis Best, Andris Biedrins|
|10|Spencer Hawes, Ben Gordon, Mike Woodson|Lionel Hollins, Chris Childs|

And just for fun, the median outcome for the *best* 2nd round pick, 31st, is Joe Alexander. Who ? Exactly.

All this isn’t even mentioning that, in the current NBA, it’s increasingly difficult to hold onto whoever you draft with a high pick. So there are few good players that are statistically bolstering the median, and even moreso average value of the players drafted at a certain pick, but nowadays, odds are a large chunk of that value isn’t even going to be for the team that picked the guy. Further downgrading the value of a pick.

----------

Now, to be fair, those are the values of what each specific pick ends up being worth. But you could make the argument that the inherent value of a pick is the best player left available at that spot, not the player picked with it.

Personally, I don’t really agree with that, because, again, statistically, it’s almost impossible to actually get the “best player still available” with any pick that isn’t no1. 

For example, from 1984 to 2016, according the WS stat, the player picked 2nd ended up being the best player still available at second a total of … 4 times. Out of 33, AKA 12%. This isn’t because 88% of front offices are incompetent, it’s because the draft is a crapshoot. Even with all the scouting and player projection stats in the world, it’s almost impossible to know ahead of time who the best player left is. Front offices keep convincing themselves that, because they’re good, they’ll actually get value out of a 6th or 8th pick or whatever, but odds are, they won’t.

But here’s the catch, even if every single front office from 1984 to 2016 had a time machine, and could know in advance who the best player available at each pick was, picks *still* wouldn’t be as valuable as you think.

Here’s the value of the “best player left” at each pick :

More notes :

- Obviously, it’s a lot better. But there’s still a big gap between no1 and the rest.

- If you’re wondering why the list ends at 56, it’s because there’s never been any NBA draft from 1984 to 2016 in which 57 or more players actually played in the league.

Here's an example of a couple of retired players whose career VORP and WS are roughly equal to the median value of the best player left at each top-10 pick :

|Pick|Players approaching median value (VORP)|Players approaching median value (WS)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Chris Webber, Andre Iguodala, Manu Ginobili|Dominique Wilkins, Dikembe Mutombo, Bob Lanier|
|2|Ron Harper, Robert Horry, Bobby Jones|Rod Strickland, Michael Finley, David West|
|3|Chris Bosh, Shawn Kemp, Steve Francis|Mike Bibby, Ricky Pierce, Bill Cartwright|

|7|Stephen Jackson, Tony Allen, Anderson Varejao|Kenny Smith, Steve Kerr, Jalen Rose|
|8|Jalen Rose, Monta Ellis, Larry Kenon|Brendan Haywood, Jamal Mashburn|
|9|Josh Howard, Matt Bonner|Shawn Bradley, Vinny Del Negro|
|10|Roy Hibbert, Jim Paxson, Anthony Parker|Mo Williams, Glenn Robinson, Raef LaFrentz|

Sure, it’s better, but still. The best player you can expect to still be available with a 5th pick in the draft is a Rick Fox level player ? Is a 5th pick *that* valuable, considering Rick Fox is who you could reasonably expect to get, **assuming you get lucky and pick the best player available** ??

-----

#Conclusion

A set pick, after the lottery has taken place, is not that valuable. Teams fall in love with the possibility of getting something great, and grossly overvalue them. The Lakers’ 4th pick, for example. The best player that the Lakers (or whoever trades for that pick) can expect to be available at that slot is a Luol Deng, Antoine Walker level player. And statistically, no team with the 4th pick has ever actually correctly picked the 4th best player on that draft. So the best player that will be available, likely won’t be better than a 2 or 3 time All-Star, and it’s almost certain that you won’t even guess who it is.

But a future pick, that you have zero idea (especially with the flattened lottery odds) where it’s actually going to end up in the draft, in a draft class that you can’t possibly know the strength and depth of a year or two ahead of time ? That should have less value than any reasonably decent NBA player.

Say a team like Chicago was offering up its 2021 first round draft pick. GMs around the league would be salivating at that idea, and ready to pay through the nose for it. But the expected return for that pick is actually lower than a guy like Elfrid Payton or Terry Rozier. But if Chicago traded their 2021 1st for one of those guys, the entire NBA world would go crazy.

Oh, and I haven’t even mentioned that, since the one-and-done rule is one the way out, the draft is going to become *even more* of a crapshoot.

**TL;DR** Just as someone eventually figured out that 3 point shots, or versatile wing defenders, were undervalued, some GM will inevitably figure out that draft picks are overrated. Any team that isn’t a bottom feeder and owns a pick that’s perceived as having value (Celtics having the Grizzlies pick, Lakers’ 4th pick, etc) should look to sell high on that pick immediately. Any team that’s looking to rebuild should look to free agency as their way out, or smart trades for good young players, not tanking. Building a contender through the draft only works if you manage to hoard a shitton of high first rounders, and get very, *very* lucky.",0.55,controversial,5/16/19 12:47
653,I rewatched the second quarter of last nights Celtics-Sixers game and took a look at every foul call against the Celtics,0,8hv9fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8hv9fe/i_rewatched_the_second_quarter_of_last_nights/,39,1525799124,"Since a lot of people were outraged about the fould discrepancy in that quarter and attributed it to the league wanting to extend the series, I looked at every foul call and tried to determine if it was the right call. I don't have a horse in the race since the Sixers beat our ass in the last round and fuck the Celtics anyway.   


1. 10:43 Marcus Morris: Right call. grabs Embiid in the paint to prevent a layup
2. 07:43 Marcus Smart: Right call. swipes Embiid across the face and doesn't complain for a second afterwards
3. 07:31 Jaylen Brown: Soft call. technically the right call because Jaylen is out of position when the contact with Saric occurs. The refs should not have called that on the first contact imo. 
4. 07:01 Jayson Tatum (offensive foul): Right call. Tatum grabs Redick's arm and pulls him to the ground when trying to establish position in the post. 
5. 05:56 Semi Ojeleye: Right call. even though Belinelli flops a bit. Ojeleye pushes Belinelli into Simmons after a screen. 
6. 05:15 Semi Ojeleye: Probably the right call but could have been a play on imo. There is no replay but it looks like Ojeleye is out of position when the contact with Ilyasova occurs and he doesn't complain much after the call which is usually a sign for a right call. 
7. 04:21 Marcus Morris: Right Call. He hits Saric on the arm.
8. 03:50 Marcus Morris: Really hard to tell. Redicks tries to go over an Embiid screen and it seems like Morris pushes him of his path. No replay so impossible to tell how much contact really occurred. 
9. 02:51 Aron Baynes: Right call. Baynes slowly reacts to Embiids movement and does not establish position before the contact.
10. 02:40 Marcus Smart: It's the loose ball foul that's also on the front page. Watching it live in real time it seemed like the right call. Simmons steals the ball, Smart dives to the floor and it looks he hit's Simmons legs causing him to fall. In the replay you can see that Simmons starts to fall before the contact occurs and it should have been a no call. Really difficult call to make imo because in that situation it's a foul on the defender almost every other time.
11. 02:31 Terry Rozier (offensive foul): Right call hits Redick in the face. Afterwards the scuffle with Embiid occurs where a double tech was warranted imo. 
12. 01:40 Jaylen Brown: Really hard to tell. There is some grabbing and pushing going on between Brown and Belinelli away from the ball. To me it looks like a bit of a flop by Belinelli, which you could also consider a veteran move by him. He sold the call and Brown should have not engaged in that contact with 2 Fouls already.   


In conclusion I would say that foul calls against the Celtics were mostly warranted with few questionables among them. What I didn't check for is non-calls that the Celtics should have gotten in their favor. But the 12 fouls that were called against them during that quarter are not evidence that the league tried to rigg the game.",0.5,controversial,5/8/18 10:05

All last year, and during this offseason everyone has been shitting on him because he sucked so bad. Now we trade him, and everyone instantly gets on the ""LET'S SHIT ON THE KINGS RIGHT MEOW"" bandwagon.

Do you guys not understand?

We just dumped our two WORST contracts. Not just bad, but WORST. You think Philly would just take those on for free? Fuck no. We HAD to give up Stauskas just so they get SOMETHING out of this deal.

Yeah, it sucks we had to give him up after one year, and I have no doubt he will continue to improve and be a good player. BUT, now we are in a great position with arond $25million in cap space instead of $10million.

Everyone says"" Yeah, but clearing cap space doesn't mean shit if free agents dont sign there."" And yes, this is true, BUT we have already secured an appointment with Wes Matthews, and we can offer him more money than both Dallas and Toronto who are the other 2 teams interested in him at this point.

So, we are essentially trading Nik Stauskas for Wes Matthews, because odds are, if we offer him the most money, he will come to Sacramento. No matter how shitty a situation, MONEY TALKS. 

Wes is an immediate upgrade on BOTH ends of the floor, and along with Collison, Rudy Gay, Willie Cauley-Stein, and DeMarcus, that's a damn good starting lineup now. We also still have about $10 million left in cap space to sign other players who we need, whether it be Rondo(which i really hope we don't do), or just solid bench players.

So before everyone keeps running Sacramento into the ground, lets see what happens.

If Wes comes to Sacramento, are you REALLY going to talk shit about this deal? Yes, Nik could end up being better than Wes, but it's going to take at LEAST 3 years for that to happen, and Kings are trying to get a .500+ team before the new arena opens. 

WE DONT NEED TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. JUST WIN 42+ GAMES AND MAYBE SNIFF PLAYOFFS AND KINGS FANS ARE HAPPY.

So please, instead of shitting on the Kings in every possible way possible, wait and see what happens. If we end up getting no free agents to come this offseason after trading Nik, THEN talk shit about us. But not yet.",0.47,controversial,7/2/15 5:45

**Ben's a rookie. But...**


Let's take a look at some timeline stuff here.



9/30/2016 Ben broke his foot.


01/21/2017  [Ben](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKRJmuPQidE) is seen warming up with his team on a road game. He doesn't look 100% but you can see he's made a lot of progress, and is practicing with the team.


07/10/2017 Philly.com writes an article about how much a year in the NBA benefitted [him.](http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/sixers/ben-simmons-sixers-process-year-off-injury-joel-embiid-20170710.html). This was about a month after the 2017 NBA draft. I think this is significant because I've heard a lot of fans say that Ben's first year didn't benefit him that much, but I think that there are a lot of holes in that argument. 


I think there are 3 reasons why a year in the NBA (even if some of that time is spent injured) is more beneficial than a year in the NBA:

* Basketball is now their life. They don't have to worry about school or any other non-basketball related things. 
* They now have access to the best coaches and trainers in the world. Coaches in the NCAA are good, but the NBA has an overall better player development facilitation.
* They get to develop chemistry with their teammates. Whether it's in practice, or socially, I believe that off court chemistry often translates to on court chemistry.


I understand that Ben is still a rookie, I'm not trying to argue against that. But what if to even the playing field, we counted stats for Donny from 11/20/2017? I'm aware that a lot of people won't agree with this. Donny is still having a great overall season. But from 11/20/2017, he's doing even better.  


**So, what if we didn't count Donovan's first month**


DM since 11/20/2017: 
* 22.0/3.9/3.8 with a TS% of 55.7%. 


Only 20 players in the league average at least 21/3/3 since 11/20/2107. DM is 11th on that list in FG%. 


Out of all the players that are under 6'4"", there are only 7 who have similar or better [stat](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=AGE&dir=-1&CF=PTS*G*21:AST*G*3:REB*G*3&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F23%2F2018&Height=LT%206-4) line. This obviously isn't a standalone argument, but I find it interesting. Some good company on that list. 


**Donovan's Rebounding**  


One of the main arguments against Donovan not getting ROY is that Ben averages double his rebounds. Which seems silly to me, since rebounding has in large part due to height, so it make sense that an agile 6'10"" guard would have more rebounds than Dono, at 6'3"". But I wanted to prove that Donny is a damn good rebounder for his height. So I found [this](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&dir=1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&CF=GP*G*50:REB*G*3&Height=LT%206-4). He's 4th in the league in contested rebounds compared to players under 6'4"".


I also found it interesting that Ben is [second to last](https://stats.nba.com/players/rebounding/?sort=REB_CONTEST_PCT&dir=-1&CF=REB*GE*7&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&Height=GT%206-4) in contested rebounds amongst players who average 7 or more rebounds and are taller than 6'4"". Again, not a convincing standalone stat, and Ben is still a good rebounder, but maybe the gap between Dono and Ben isn't as wide as the season averages suggest.


**Donovan's Assists**


Again, a common argument against Dono is that he only averages half the amount of assists as Ben. Here's what I found on that:


* Ben averages 75.4 passes a game. That's 10 more than the next highest passer. 
* He assists 7.8 times a game so that means has just above 10% pass to assist ratio. Which doesn't sound bad and could in large part have to do with the 76ers offense, but when you compare him to the rest of the players in the NBA, he's 37th on the list of pass to assist ratio% for players that pass the ball more than 30 times a game. 
* However, only 15 players are averging more than 7 assists a game.
* Out of 75.4 passes made, 16.5 are potential assists. And out of those 16.5, 7.8 of those end up being assists. The Don's numbers: 38.5 passes made, 6.9 are potential assists, and 3.6 end up being assists. 


Not a huge argument against Ben, I don't think it matters that he passes the ball alot, and get's passed to a lot(80 times a game). But, the percentage of assists is what I was looking at. Donovan averages 9.8% assists a game, meaning that if he passed the ball as much as Ben, he'd average just as many assists. Interestingly enough, Dario Saric averages almost as many assists as Ben - and the Jazz don't have a single player that averages more than 5. Everyone averages from like 3-5.



**Donovan is the Jazz's #1 scoring option and go to in the clutch**


I think the game last night against the Spurs is the answer as to why he is. He's got a lot of room to improve still which is the crazy thing. This is one of the bigger reasons why I think this ROTY race is close, and Ben isn't as much of a shoe in as people may think. Donovan is leading the team in scoring, and is clearly the guy that the Jazz want to have the ball in his hands in close situations as a rookie. But let's look at some stats and see how he fares against the rest of the league and maybe you'll see why I put so much weight on it. It's not a comparison to Ben's TDs, it's a comparison to the rest of the league this year.

 

* Donny is 4th in the NBA in 4th Q USG% and 9th in 2nd half USG%. 
* He's 8th in scoring in the second half, only 1.4 points behind the MVP James Harden. 
* He averages 7.2 pts in the 4th Q (4th in the league). Not that it matters, but that's almost double what Ben averages(3.7)
* [Context is everything](https://stats.nba.com/players/traditional/?sort=PTS&dir=-1&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F24%2F2018&Period=4&CF=GP*G*35) I think it's significant to point out that he's ahead of James Harden, Lebron, Giannis, Lillard, Irving and on and on. His rebound and assists go up in the 4th - in fact just about everything improves in the 4th for Donny.  


**How do the Jazz do when Donovan excells?**


* When Spida scores more than 1/4 of his season average for scoring in the 4Q (so more than 5PTS), the Jazz are 25-15 (which includes a tough as shit december where we were without our star center). 
* The Jazz are 28-15 when he averages more than half his season average in the 2nd half (again includes a hard december). 
* Since December 30th, they're 22-4 when he averages more than half his season average in the 2nd half. 


One thing I found interesting is when Don overperforms with his rebounds and assists.

* When DMitch has 2 or more assists in the 2nd half, the jazz are 26-13.
* When he has 2 or more rebounds in the 2nd half, they're 29-14.

Again, not a standalone argument. But still something of note. It's also interesting at doing the same thing with Ben's rebounds and assists.


* When Ben has 4 or more assists in the 2nd half, the 76ers are 16-14. 
* When he has 2 or more assists in the 4th Q, they're 14-17. 
* When he has 2 or more rebounds in the 4th Q, they're 21-16. 
* They're 22-14 when he has more than 4 rebounds in the 2nd half. 

It's really interesting to see how they don't do as well when Ben assists a lot in the 4th Q. Not really sure why, or if it's even significant. 


**Other Stats about the Don's scoring**

* Donovan is [12th](https://stats.nba.com/players/scoring/?sort=PCT_UAST_2PM&dir=-1&CF=MIN*G*30:GP*G*30&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) in the league in unassisted 2 point FG% at 76.7 - meaning he creates shots for himself. 
* He's [9th](https://stats.nba.com/players/drives/?sort=DRIVE_PTS&dir=1&CF=DRIVES*G*8&Season=2017-18&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&DateFrom=11%2F20%2F2017&DateTo=03%2F24%2F2018) in the league in points off of drives at 7.9 at 47.8%. James Harden is at 53%  It's actually where DM gets a third of his assists too; off of the drive. 


**Making history**


Let me first point out that Ben's TD record is really impressive. Definitely one of the main arguments for him getting ROY. But since when have triple doubles been the pinnacle of succes where all other stats pale in comparison to the almighty triple double? I think it definitely holds a lot of significance, but I don't know if it's as much of a trump card as people say it is. If it matters, the 6ers are 6-4 when Ben get's a TD.


So where does Donovan stand?

* 2 40+ point games. Most since Blake Griffin and if I knew how to compare that to rookies over the past 20+ years I would - but I'm guessing it's pretty impressive. One of those games includes the 6th most effecient 40 point game (based on fg%) this season if you filter out games where people took less than 6 3PA and is 9th if you include those. He had 5 rebounds and 6 assists in that game too might I add, and had a TS% of 95.5%, and offensive rating of 141.1, a defensive rating of 82.2, and a net rating of 58.8 in 33 minutes. The Jazz are 2-0 when Dono scores more than 40. 
* 25 25+ point games. I don't know how that compares to other other rookies in like the past 20-30 years but I would assume it's significant. That Jazz's record during those games? 16-9; 13-3 since december 30th (Ugh, that december...). Donny averages 51.46/36/85.3, and an EFG% of 58.1 in these games.
* 39 20+ point games. I really wish I could find the stats on how that compares to rookies over the past 20-30 years. The Jazz are 25-14 when he scores 20 or more points. 
* He's currrently on pace to averge more than 20 pts a game. Only 44 rookies have ever done that all time, and 21 since 1980. 
* He's also on pace to tie Damien Lillards record of most 3 pointers made by a rookie, and be 2nd (behind Joe Ingles) in most 3 pointers made in a season in franchise history.



**What a time to be a basketball fan**


Alright, I think that's all I got. My ultimate goal of this whole thing is to convince people that the race for ROY is and should be close. I'll also point out how awesome that is. How lucky are the Jazz and the 76ers. 


One last thought. Ben is incredible and will be well deserving of the award if he wins (and the future MVPs he'll win). Despite what a lot of people say I don't think that the fact that Ben doesn't shoot threes(yet) or has a below average FT% should count against him. Just like because of some of the stats I've listed above I don't think that the fact that Donovan doesn't have as many assists or rebounds as Ben does has as much weight as people say it does. 


A lot of these stats are pulled from 11/20/17, but most of them are pretty similar to if you changed it to the entire year. The biggest difference is that Donovan averages(currently) 20 points on the year, and 22 from 11/20/2017.


p.s. I welcome all criticism if you think some of my stats are off/ don't mean anything and would love to hear your opinion about any of them. 




TL;DR Basically, this ROTY is and should be close. Look at some of my points above if you don't believe me.

Edit 2: Had a USG% stat in there that was way off. Not sure where I got that from. Removed it.

I would change my post but no-one is really gonna see it since it got downvoted to oblivion for some reason.

Edit 5: Dario averages nearly 7 rebounds, not assists. My bad.",0.53,controversial,3/25/18 2:31
656,[OC] Why the Celtics' 21-4 start won't be sustainable.,3,7ht9d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7ht9d0/oc_why_the_celtics_214_start_wont_be_sustainable/,64,1512540651,"Before I start, I want to say that this post isn't calling the Celtics a bad team or disparaging their red-hot start to the season. It's just saying that their crazy success so far may be unsustainable.

When the Celtics' season started off with Gordon Hayward's gruesome leg injury and an 0-2 start, no one on r/nba or in the real world expected the Celtics would perform nearly as well as they have so far. However, the young, woke Celtics have been 21-2 since then including victories over the Raptors, Thunder, Spurs and Warriors. Their hot start has been fueled by great 3-point shooting (8th 3P% in the NBA), excellent team defense (1st in DefRtg). However, these stats- and this hot streak- are very unsustainable.

**Three-Point Shooting**

The Celtics are 8th in the NBA in three-point percentage, and if you factor out Marcus Smart's abysmal 29.6% on 4.3 attempts per game, they jump all the way up to 2nd. This three-point shooting boost has been heavily influenced by the improvement of Al Horford and Jaylen Brown from beyond the arc, and the surprising shooting ability of Jayson Tatum. 

Al Horford finished last year shooting 35.5% from beyond the arc, which is about his career average. However, this year he's started out at a scorching 44.6%-a 9.1% jump. 9.1% is the difference between Lonzo Ball's three-point percentage and Khris Middleton's. It doesn't take a genius or a Bayesian statistician to predict that the odds of that lasting are low. However, even if he sustains his percentages miraculously, odds are that Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum won't.

Jaylen Brown has nearly tripled his three-point attempts this season, which usually correlates with a decrease in percentage. Instead, his percentage has actually increased from 34.1% to 40.2%. This 6% increase is the difference between LeBron's three-point percentage in 2004 and his three-point percentage this year. Both Brown and Horford will likely come back to earth, and that's without mentioning Jayson Tatum.

Jayson Tatum is shooting 51.3% from 3 this season, a ridiculously high percentage considering he was a 34.2% shooter in college. If Lonzo Ball makes his next 90 three-point attempts, his three-point percentage still won't have made the same jump Tatum's has. Tatum has been putting up excellent shooting numbers this season, as have Horford and Brown, but the truth is that all these percentages are unsustainable.

**Defense and ""Intangibles""**

The Celtics have also been the number one defensive team in the NBA during their hot start, arguably even more important to their success than their three-point shooting. However, teams have been shooting pretty poorly against them. Teams shoot a paltry 34 percent from three against the Celtics, the 26th-highest percentage against any team in the NBA, and only 48.4 percent from inside the arc, also good for 26th. However, it's been shown many times that opponent field goal percentage isn't really affected by defense, so these numbers may also be fluky. The Celtics are certainly a very good defensive team, due in no small part to coach Brad Stevens, but they probably aren't the best team in the league by a good margin like their DefRtg would show.

The Celtics have demonstrated the ability to win close games this season and close out in the last few minutes. This trait, while certainly a sign of a good team, is also very luck-based and will revert closer to the mean over the course of the season. The only way their close game win percentage can be sustainable is if Kyrie Irving does what Isaiah ""Mr. 4th Quarter"" Thomas did last year and continues to put up insane fourth quarter numbers. However, if that doesn't happen, the Celtics will probably revert closer to their Pythagorean win total, which would put them currently at 18-7.

Even more factors, like the Celtics' bottom-five strength of schedule, have helped them during their miraculous winning streak. And looking at the statistics, it's just not going to be possible for the Celtics to maintain their 65-win pace. Sooner or later they will revert back to the mean.

**Conclusion: The Celtics are still good**

However, the mean for the Celtics is still very good. Brad Stevens, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, and a plethora of talented role players won the 1-seed last year with an arguably worse roster. Sure, they probably aren't in the Cavs/Warriors/Rockets tier yet, but if their young stars develop they can get there soon especially with their top-tier coaching. The Boston Celtics are a problem for the rest of the NBA and, with their young stars, future assets, and GM-wizard Danny Ainge, will be for a long time.",0.51,controversial,12/5/17 22:10

658,Brandon Ingram is One of The Most Overrated Players in The League,538,a8xjgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a8xjgt/brandon_ingram_is_one_of_the_most_overrated/,466,1545622292,"When Brandon was drafted, a lot of people, myself included, thought he’d be a walking bucket. As a Duke fan, I loved to cheer for him in college and I thought he’d be great in the league.
  
  
Obviously, he dissapointed massively in his rookie season. That might have been the worst season i’ve ever seen a player play. He struggled to score in any fashion whatsoever. I’ll admit Ingram’s come far from his rookie season as one of the worst players in the league to become a good player. But now I think he’s becoming massively overrated. 
  
  
The stigma around Ingram I’ve seen in past and current trade talks label him a marquee talent I personally think he’s undeserving of, and I find that casual fans or fans from other teams are very unaware about the type of player he is. They might tout his 39% 3PP from last year to describe him as a great shooter, but anybody who watches him here obviously know that that percentage came as a result of a very selective shot selection. He doesn’t like to shoot any off the dribble 3s or rhythm threes. He only considers taking them when he’s at least two feet wide open. They commonly for some reason I don’t know think of him as some low post or mid range savant, but he’s far from that. I mean sure he **takes** a lot of pull ups and post up shots, but he makes about barely enough of them to warrant him a pass to keep attempting them. For his pull ups, i’ve compared him to somebody who takes around as many pull up shots as him: Jamal Murray. Last season from 10-16 ft, Ingram shoots 35% compared to Murray’s 48%. For post ups, I compared his second season to Kobe in his rookie season since they were in somewhat similar positions and took the same frequency of shots from 3-10 ft. Ingram shot 20.7% compared to Kobe’s 40.9%. That’s half of Kobe’s percentage. He is by every means a below average shooter from these areas. Every label he’s given as a shooter is wildly innacurate, and frankly I don’t think his 3 point shot will ever be his bread and butter as a result of his hesitancy like it sort of was at Duke. The dude also is given credit as a great playmaker, but I’d say he’s just average. He misses one or two too many reads a game.
  
  
So, what are his strengths? Does he have any? I’ll give him props on D. He can be a pest on the perimeter with his length. Maybe driving? He converted on 65.7% of his shots from close range last season. He is also consistent i’d say. You can always expect around 15 points, 3 assists and 3 rebounds from him. 
  
  
As you can see, Ingram’s not amazing at anything. In fact, I’d say even his consistency could be spun against his case as a future all star because he is consistently average. He doesnt like to go all out for one game and excluding his career high against the Warriors, in his 2 and a half years in the league so far, as far as I am concerned he has had no breakout game. So what’s my problem with Ingram, he’s not amazing at any particular thing. Like for Lonzo, I can say he’s a great passer and defender. I can say Kuzma’s a great shooter, because he’s shown multiple glimpses of his potential. He’s made 6 threes in a half before and scored over 30 a couple times, but I can’t say anything similar about Ingram.

Conclusively, Ingram is average at almost everything. He is, however, very well rounded. And for that reason i’d say he his ceiling is a fringe all star. Maybe a top 40-50 player. Very good, but not the best. I’d love to say otherwise, but he hasn’t shown me much yet.

People have very innacurate conceptions about the type of player BI is.",0.6,controversial,12/23/18 19:31

660,Dwight Howard is NOT the best Center in the NBA,9,1jpuoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1jpuoc/dwight_howard_is_not_the_best_center_in_the_nba/,140,1375700954,"Dwight is going to be the defensive anchor the Houston Rockets next year. He rebounds, blocks, alters shots, and gets points on the board – so why am I writing this? Because there is one other center in the league that does all this and more. Marc Gasol is that player. He recently won the Defensive Player of the Year award, something Dwight has already achieved three consecutive times in his career. But that was then, and this is now.

Offense

Firstly, let’s look at offense. Dwight Howard averaged a very respectable 17.1ppg for the Lakers last season. He was recovering from back surgery at the time, so I will give him the benefit of the doubt he will get recover 100%, and am going to use the season prior to last year as a bench mark to make the comparison fairer. In that case, he averaged 20.6 and 1.9 assists in 38.3 minutes of play. Comparatively, Gasol averaged 14.1ppg and a ridiculous 4 assists a game in 35.0 minutes of play. 20.6 is a larger number than 14.1, but let’s look at the details shall we?

Dwight Howard game consists almost totally on shots at the basket – 95.45% of his shots came in the paint.

graphic

He did an amazing job shooting 66.22% under the basket and 44.31% in the paint, but his efficiently drops elsewhere. The 42.31%, although somewhat good, does not tell the whole story because he only attempted 26 shots in 54 games from there. That’s not a shot the coaching staff of the Magic, Lakers, or Rockets want him taking.

Marc Gasol’s versatility is inconceivably better than Dwight’s. He not only shoots nearly as well as Howard from inside (66.22% vs 63.85%), but his midrange game is at an extraordinary 47.69%. The 50% mark is the standard for an efficient scorer; he’s doing this at 7’1 from 15-18 feet out. Not many centers, if any at all, can achieve this result.

In this day and age, floor spacing is everything. The Heat and Spurs, the two teams in the Finals last year, bombarded their opponents with 3’s while having one big man to anchor the middle. Gasol spreads the floor so well, the Grizzles have the luxury of playing two big men at once. Dwight on the other hand is confined to just the paint.

Passing also plays a key part in floor spacing. It is the fastest way to move the ball and thus forces the defense to scramble to move with it. That is why Gasol’s 4.0 assists a game are so important. His 4.0 assists a game are better than some starting point guard’s, which is a testament to his passing ability from both the low post and high post. Dwight averaged just 1.9 assists in his last season in for the Magic, which is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing too spectacular either.

Offensive rebounding is clearly Howard’s forte. Although he didn’t qualify to be ranked because he did not manage to play 56 games, he would’ve made 5th on the list. The year before that, he came in 3rd. Marc Gasol comes in 30th, right next to Blake Griffin. However, don’t doubt Marc’s ability to grab offensive boards. Zach Randolph, his frontcourt mate, took 1st on the list and if anybody watches the Grizzles, they’ll notice the Grizzles play a high-low offense. This means Randolph is placed under the basket, while Gasol is at the foul-line extended.

The video below, at 0:16 and 0:30 and so on, shows multiple variations of plays the Grizzles use when using Randolph and Gasol. As you can see, Gasol usually plays higher up, thus preventing him any chances to grab offensive boards unless they pop out far enough. This is the play style of the Grizzles. It’s not as if Gasol cannot grab rebounds, it’s the offensive sets designed for the team which places him in inopportune places to grab them.

As time winds down on the clock, teams tend to engage the Hack-a-Howard defense. Howard shot a horrid 49.1% from the charity strip while Gasol shot 84.8%. Howard cannot be trusted going to the line but the coach cannot take him out of the game. It would be “disrespectful” toward a superstar, and the media would build a ridiculous amount of drama around it. In other words, the coach would be stuck between a rock and a hard place. Gasol on the other hand, wouldn’t need to be taken off the court when these situations come into play. His was actually best free throw shooter of all forwards and centers in the league, exluding Kevin Durant. Although free throws are generally placed at a lower level of importance, we’ve all seen how important when teams are so good, the only thing separating them is a few easy buckets.

The last few things I want to go over is minutes, usage, and TO’s. Howard clearly gets more minutes than Gasol does. More minutes means more opportunities. The same goes for usage and TO’s. It’s understandable that Howard has more turnovers (3.2) compared to Gasol’s (2.0), but clearly, Gasol’s role has him passing more. Furthermore, Howard’s extra minutes, usage, and thus more points, help soften the disparity Howard’s and Gasol’s points per game.

Defense

Many people look at blocks and steals as the only measurement of defense. Even Dwight Howard said Serge Ibaka should’ve won the last two DPoY awards because “he led the league in blocks. That’s what defense is all about.” I highly doubt defense is hinged solely on blocks from bigs. If that were true, Sanders is the second best defensive big man this season, JaVale the season before, and Bogut should’ve won the DPoY 3 years ago instead of Howard. Clearly it’s very difficult to judge defense because all five players need to communicate and work as one unit – a different beast when compared to offense.

The pick-and-roll is used so often nowadays with the influx of amazing guards, big men need to learn to “hedge.” Howard is very quick on his feet and hedges so well that his guard can recover without letting the opposing guard drive right by, or let the big dive into the middle. Gasol does this as well, although his foot speed isn’t as quick as Howard’s.

Help defense is a key role in determining a good defensive player. Howard arguably does this better than any other big man. On the Lakers, Pau Gasol didn’t have the foot speed to keep up with the “stretch 4’s.” Howard was usually quick to rotate and help block/alter shots. Likewise, Marc Gasol does this too, but he isn’t nearly as athletic or quick as Howard. His blocks are slightly lower, 1.7 to Dwight’s 2.1, but that doesn’t mean Gasol didn’t help his team. The Grizzles had a 95.4 defensive rating with him on the court, good for second in the league, but a mediocre 102.2 with him off the court. Howard too helped the Lakers tremendously when he was on the court earning a 101.7 DR and 107.8 (near the bottom of the league) off the court. It’s hard to justify one better than the other because, although the Grizzles had a much better defensive rating with Gasol on the court compared to the Lakers and Howard, the Grizzles are just a better team defensively overall. A part of help defense is closing out on three point shooters. Howard takes this because of pure quickness and athleticism.

Defensive rebounding is the final key ingredient to a good defense, at least, when you don’t have a player like LeBron James. Howard wins this category because of his ridiculous 10.8 defensive boards compared to Gasol’s measly 5.8. I do believe Howard is a better rebounder, but I would like to point out Howard was running with 4 shooters while the Grizzle had two big men in the paint splitting rebounds. Nevertheless, I cannot discount Howard’s league-leading monster rebounding prowess.

Edit: Added an extra parapgraph concerning free throws.


tl;dr Just because Dwight's ppg and boards are higher than Gasol's doesn't automatically make him a better center. Offensively, Gasol shoots just as well inside as Dwight, and CONSIDERABLY better than the league in the midrange. He's also a damn good passer - just like his brother Pau. Defensively, I gotta say Dwight wins because of sheer athleticism and quickness. Both are great centers, I just think Gasol's better.",0.52,controversial,8/5/13 4:09

Examples inside.",0,39zyiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/39zyiv/opinion_dellavedova_tends_to_show_reckless/,125,1434454987,"You may have your opinions on whether or not Dellavedova is an intentionally reckless or malicious player, but I've put together five plays that I thought exhibited a pattern of behavior: Delly is involved in several tripping incidents or attempts to trip players.

Not all of these are initially Delly's fault- but it does seem like he likes to fall near opponent's legs, throw his own legs in the way of their legs, or in some cases... deliberately knock a player down in retaliation.

Full disclosure, I am a homer and I hate watching this guy play. But I'm here to show why this opinion may be justified, and to shed light on a few incidents that were glossed over during the infamous exodus of Warriors fans between Games 1-4.
_________________________

In reverse chronological-ish order:

^((Shoutout to /u/abrightersummerday and /u/kdub2000 for providing the material and timestamps for the examples)^)

**1. Curry [""falls"" mysteriously.](https://vine.co/v/eOxLbq3OtY3)**  
Even in full speed, I find it odd that Dellavedova is fully prepared for his trailing leg to tangle with Steph's. Anyone who has tangled legs while running before knows that you usually fall out of surprise and a loss of balance. A counterpoint is that Dellavedova just shows supernatural balance and is one of the truly gifted athletes of this generation.

**2. Mo Speights get the steal, [Dellavedova increases his surface area to slow his fall, like a sky diver.](https://twitter.com/BuddyGrizzard/status/607734055229136896)**  
~~I'm half inclined to think that Dellavedova is so confident in his soccer technique and the ineptitude of the referees, that he believes he can save the ball from going out of bounds with his foot. But in reality, Delly was trying to box Mo out from getting the ball, and failed. I think this type of play is reckless- if you can't box out with your body, don't try to throw your leg out there for shits and giggles.~~  
~~Of course, it's possible that Delly is actually just a sub-par athlete, but that conflicts with our previous conclusion that he's an amazing athlete with supernatural balance.~~

/u/BillionaireBob pointed out that Mo actually kicks Delly's leg out here. I was wrong about this one, this is incidental.

**3. Draymond Green sets a hard screen, [Dellavedova retaliates](http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/6/9/8755229/watch-matthew-dellavedova-dive-into-draymond-greens-knees)**  
As a homer, all I see is Dellavedova scheming to end Draymond's career by popping his kneecap open using the hidden mallet he put in his Australian-brand socks. But in reality, Draymond started it. My issue is that most men with testicles and pride would stand up and start shit, but Dellavedova is fine taking shots at Draymond's hips/knees (depending on who you're rooting for in the finals). Regardless, this incident was mere inches away from Draymond being carted home in a stretcher. I don't like players who let it get below the belt. I'm looking at you, Chris Paul.
___________________________________
**Now, the retrospective section:**

*I didn't believe these plays were dirty at all at first, in fact I defended Delly to the Warriors fans who worried for Curry's health in this matchup.*

*In retrospect, I feel differently. Is it okay to look back and re-evaluate an issue? I believe so. Context matters, and when a player has been in multiple incidents where he's not afraid to tangle up below the belt, it calls into question all of his past actions.*
___________________________________
**4. Al Horford gives Delly the People's Elbow- [but look closely-er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmznHPMBwss&feature=youtu.be&t=35)**  
Did Horford start and end this sequence? Yes. Is he to blame? Yes. But, in my opinion, at the timestamp marked, Delly was kicking his way towards Horford in an attempt to land on his legs. I may or may not have felt this way before I saw the three examples preceding this, but it wouldn't be the first time. And that of course, leads me to the final example...

**5. The Kyle Korver [Incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyXod83nR1Y#&t=27sec)**  
I know we've been over this one before, and it doesn't warrant any further discussion. *There is NOTHING about this play that would make me think it's intentional*. But I've seen the other footage, and my conclusion after these five separate events is that Dellavedova just doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't care if he breaks your legs. He doesn't care if you trip or fall. *He doesn't care about sacrificing his own body, or yours, to make a play.*

_________________________________

That last statement to me, is the real problem. When a player doesn't respect their own well-being more than they respect winning a game, it's normally a good thing. But what about when that player is small, a poor athlete, and grew up playing some sort of Australian bloodsport?

To me, Dellavedova crosses lines. He may not intend to injure players, but he doesn't seem to be particularly risk-averse. He will fall on the ground and break his knee to save a lose ball, but he'll just as quickly break your knee to do the same.

My point is that Delly's dirty play is a different breed than what we call other dirty players. Patrick Beverly may grab and hold and irritate, Draymond Green and Zbo may throw an elbow, Serge Ibaka may punch you in the nuts, the list goes on. But an elbow probably isn't going to put you in a stretcher. A punch in the balls is temporary. And besides, **how many of those players have 5 GIF-worthy incidents in a span of 10 games?** What happens when a player's entire game is predicated on crossing a line below the belt?

I obviously have vested interests here. But to me, Delly isn't playing basketball out there. And the league should do something about it- in the form of a memo, or a phone call to this kid who's overcompensating for a lack of talent in a way that puts players in danger.

No matter how good of a player Curry is, at some point (and we have reached this point) his hype is going to surpass his skills as a player.
So the next logical question is, will he be a pro? I actually think he will, although I doubt he will be a star.

> Comparisons: Best Case: I've seen a lot of people saying Mike Bibby, so I'll go with that; Worst Case: Jannero Pargo, Steve Kerr, and JJ Redick. Bottom Line: Curry is an incredibly smart player. Not only does he understand the game, he understands his limitations. He probably is never going to end up being a star in the league because of a lack of explosiveness (meaning he will be a huge defensive liability). He should be able to hang around the league because of the all-around offensive package he brings to the table. - Bleacher Report, May, 2009 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/183841-nba-draft-prospects-stephen-curry-davidson


 **Klay Thompson** 

> But, at a career 42.3 % NCAA field goal percentage, this is precisely what worries me about Thompson: He perhaps overachieves on guile and his statistical production could reflect guile’s limitations. The concern is that the Warriors drafted already-realized potential, as opposed to tapping a grower like Kawhi Leonard........It’s this kind of action that draws praise from film-gurus like Sebastian Pruiti. I’m equally impressed by his screen-usage, but more than happy to go negative with a positive: If Thompson is this smart, then why aren’t his numbers smarter? This kid certainly knows how to expertly use picks. I’m just not sure that means Golden State is equally good at it.
What does this mean for Monta? It could mean nothing. Number 11 picks don’t usually become starters (Acie Law was picked at 11, for example).
I’m less inclined to be reverent towards Jerry West than many out there. He’s had a great career, but the septuagenarian executive left Memphis in shambles. Sorry to be age-ist, but I like West better as a consultant than an ultimate decision-maker. - Warriors World, June, 2011 http://www.warriorsworld.net/2011/06/24/klay-smart-gsws-good/

> In the bigger picture, I have no idea how this arrest will affect Thompson's future. Have we seen him play his last game as a Coug? Even before his arrest, I figured that was the case. Thompson's a junior who was expected to leave early for the NBA, but there's some doubt about that because he's projected as a late-first round or second-round draft pick. Thompson has said if he were projected to go in the second round, he would stay for his senior season.
If I were an NBA GM, it wouldn't bother me, but maybe the marijuana charge will hurt his draft status. What would bother me more is the fact that Thompson isn't quite ready for the NBA, physically and I would argue emotionally as well. For as good as he is, Thompson can be surprisingly erratic, both with his shot and the ball. Remember, too, that this is also a kid who was late for the team bus in Tempe two weeks ago because he couldn't find his iPod.
But maybe I'm viewing this subjectively as the WSU alum who hopes that Thompson returns. With Thompson, Moore and DeAngelo Casto playing a third year together, the Cougs would be a top-25 team, one with the potential to crack the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament.
Whatever happens, Thompson has been consistent in one respect -- good and bad, he never ceases to make you shake your head in disbelief. - SeattlePI, March, 2011 -  http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/moore/article/Thompson-s-erratic-ways-continue-this-time-with-1042357.php 


**Last for Klay**

> He reminds me of a less-quick version of Kevin Martin. Thompson is the son of former L.A. Lakers big man Mychal Thompson. ...Can Klay Thompson play in the NBA? Absolutely. But I've read where he is being compared to Reggie Miller and that is just silly. There is a difference between good, very good, and great. Klay Thompson's 3-pt percentage, this season was 39% (good) but not the 44% (great) that Miller's was at UCLA. Miller shot 54% FG (GREAT!) as a Bruin. Thompson's, as we mentioned, is 42% (not very good). Miller, as a junior, averaged 25.9 ppg. (very good). Thompson was 21.6 as a junior (good). ...I think Klay Thompson can be a good starter in the NBA sometime - but I don't foresee stardom. - Hoops Obsession, June , 2011 http://basslinespin.blogspot.com/2011/06/i-dont-hate-klay-thompson-plus-tyler.html

**Around this time we also had the Monta Ellis trade**

> Both acquisitions are good fits with the Warriors' roster, but neither was able to help Tuesday. The team was in shock before Ellis addressed them in a closed-door meeting and said his goodbyes before the game.
Ellis has been the face of the Warriors' franchise for much of his seven seasons. He was named the league's Most Improved Player in 2007 and has been among the NBA's top scorers the past three seasons.
But he was never a good fit alongside similar-sized Curry, and he started to show his frustration with the organization in the past week. His teammates immediately shared that frustration Tuesday, when Ellis and Udoh were informed of the trade via a scroll at the bottom of the TV.
As many players shook their heads in disbelief, Curry walked over and hugged a solo Udoh. Wright said, ""I'll talk about the game, but I'm not talking about the trade crap."" One Warriors player said, ""If we're giving up, I can feel my hip hurting already.""
""It's time,"" said a smiling Ellis. ""They're moving in a new direction. I can't be mad about that. I was in those shoes at one time, when a veteran guy was playing in front of me. It becomes time for that player to go. It's my time to go.""
The move opens immediate playing time for rookie Klay Thompson, a shooting guard who is getting rave reviews around the league and is considered nearly untouchable by the Warriors.
**With a potential playoff run all but lost, the move also opens the door for the Warriors to be more cautious with Curry's recurring ankle/foot injuries.** They maintain that they're going to try to win as many games as possible, but they'll be shorthanded and could see a precipitous drop in the standings. - SFGATE - March, 2012 http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Warriors-send-Monta-Ellis-to-Milwaukee-Bucks-3406832.php


**more...**


> The Milwaukee Bucks need to head on over to their local casino and put some serious bets down on the roulette table, because they are the luckiest bunch of guys in the country right now.
With the first big trade of the 2011-12 NBA season, the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed to send Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson to the Golden Warriors for Monta Ellis, Ekpe Udoh and Kwame Brown.
After reading that, if you're left thinking ""why in the world would the Warriors make a trade like that?"", you're not alone.
There's no doubt that Andrew Bogut is a solid big man when he's healthy, but Golden State didn't necessarily make an upgrade at any position with this trade. Instead of becoming a better team, they sent away solid and consistent production for an injury-prone player, and a player that's well past his prime in Stephen Jackson.


> To understand the insanity that exists within this trade, just take a minute and look at the comparison between all the players' combined production for each team in this trade.
Bogut and Jackson: 21.8 PPG, 11.5 RPG, 5.6 APG, 24.8 PER, 40.2 FG%
Ellis, Udoh and Brown: 33.7 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 7.2 APG, 41.8 PER, 46.7 FG%
Aside from rebounds per game, the Warriors are the clear winners when it comes to every major statistical category. If you take out both players that are currently injured, Andrew Bogut and Kwame Brown, those statistics become that much more lopsided in the Bucks' favor. Not only are the Warriors sending away a significant amount of offensive production, they are also getting rid of three players that are much more efficient than the talent they are getting in return, which will certainly hold Golden State back this year and into the future. - Bleacher Report, 2012 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1103923-nba-trade-deadline-why-the-warriors-trading-away-monta-ellis-makes-no-sense

**and then Draymond Green comes**

> Draymond Green is in a staring contest with history right now, and usually, history doesn’t blink first.
For the Golden State Warriors second-rounder, failure is practically assured.
But why? How can we be so certain of Green’s fate at such an early juncture in his career?
The answer is simple.
Green comes from the most historically cursed category of NBA players: He’s a Consensus First Team All-American who wasn’t drafted in the first round.
Moreover, scouts are virtually unanimous in saying that he knows how to play and has a terrific basketball IQ.
What he doesn’t have is a position.
There are concerns that Green, generously listed at 6’8” and 236 pounds, won’t be able to defend either forward spot in the NBA—not to mention that he’s had problems with his conditioning in the past.
So, the odds are stacked against Draymond Green.
If he puts together a solid career, he’ll buck the trend that no player like him has ever been able to.
For what it’s worth, I’m hopeful Green can break the mold into which he’s been cast. Maybe all 30 NBA GMs were wrong to let him slip out of the first round. It’s possible.
But history is standing firmly in front of Green, dispassionately staring him down. - Bleacher Report, 2012  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1248077-golden-state-warriors-why-history-dooms-draymond-green




**Then Golden State fires Mark Jackson after two straight playoff years**

> He continued to put his players in the best possible positions to succeed and grow, particularly his young core. Stephen Curry went from a good, young scorer to an NBA All-Star Game starter under Jackson. Klay Thompson went from a timid rookie to a fearless two-way force. Draymond Green went from being a second-round pick to being one of the most valuable bench players in the NBA.
Jackson's club was the league's third-best road team. His starting lineup had the best plus-minus in the NBA.
Since that article, Jackson's merit has only increased. He almost knocked the Los Angeles Clippers out of the playoffs despite not having Andrew Bogut—his best defensive player and rebounder—on the court. He kept his team together amid nearly unprecedented levels of conflict, deceit and paranoia within the organization. He was endorsed heavily by all of his players.
There are only 10 coaches in the league—at most—that did as good a job as Jackson did of maximizing their talent and getting their teams to buy in, compete and execute.
Jackson deserved to be the Warriors coach next season, and it is not even close. The problem is that ""deserve"" has nothing to do with it. Joe Lacob, Golden State's majority owner, did not want him to be the coach, and so he fired him.


> That's when the locker room starts to weaken. Curry starts to realize that the reason he wanted to be on the Warriors for his entire career was not something inherent about the team or location but rather the special atmosphere that Jackson had created.
Free agents that would have once flocked to Oakland at a discount (such as Iguodala did) start to shy away from signing in a place where the ownership has a history of breaking up successful, potential-laden teams due to ulterior motives.
As quickly as Lacob shed the darkness and dysfunction that had been plaguing the franchise for 20 years, the Jackson firing could ultimately trigger a rapid descent back into NBA obscurity as soon as 2017. - Bleacher Report, 2014 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1651457-mark-jackson-firing-reveals-true-priorities-of-golden-state-warriors-ownership


**Steve Kerr is hired**

> Ownership has spun this into the notion that the two-headed combination of Myers and Lacob had had enough of the offense and personal interaction issues. Steve Kerr ostensibly solves both of these problems at once. And yet, this still leaves open the door to the question as to whether the credentials were worth going this high and blind, flying all the way to Oklahoma City after their Game 6, to woo the guy they wanted?
> Kerr was and is Lacob's guy all along. For whatever reason it may be, he got what he wanted.
> If the team desired offensive innovation they could simply go with Mike D'Antoni and bank on the defenders to keep playing at their requisite talent. If they wanted a fresh face with coaching experience and a fun offense, there was Fred Hoiberg. Hell, they were even ready to interview Lionel Hollins, a coach that ran into most of the same problems Jackson was a part of near the end of the season.
> But Lacob's comfortability and connections led him to the glitzy hire of Steve Kerr. We just don't know what was so glitzy to begin with. - SBNation/Warriors , May 2014,  http://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2014/5/15/5719552/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-coach-lacob


**In comes Kevin Durant**

> Kevin Durant could join the Warriors this summer. That is possible because, in the 2016 NBA offseason, almost anything is possible. The $1 billion in salary cap space and the lack of bad long-term contracts around the league open doors that would have been inconceivable in almost any other year.
The notion of Durant, the offseason’s top free agent, joining the Warriors, the NBA’s top team, is simple enough, as Sporting News has explained in the past. The notion of Durant joining the other foremost Western Conference power, however, is more complicated and perhaps more interesting. - Sporting News, May, 2016  

> For the rest of this decade, any superstar has a better chance of making the Finals in the East. The West has Golden State, San Antonio, OKC (for now), the star-crossed Clippers, the savvy Blazers and the precocious T-Wolves lurking like Arya Stark. That’s a murderers’ row. The East has Cleveland (FYI: Year 14 for LeBron next season), Boston’s Collection of Awesome Assets That Can’t Translate to an Actual Contender Yet, Whatever Toronto Is, Whatever Atlanta Was, Whatever Orlando and Milwaukee Might End Up Being, Whatever Pat Riley Might Have up His Sleeve and that’s about it. (Sorry, Knicks fans.) You want an easier road to the title, go East. Or sign with the Warriors.Durant knows this. I promise you. He hasn’t made the Finals since 2012 for a variety of reasons: injuries, cheap owners, shaky coaching, bad luck, a stacked conference, and one dreadfully short-sighted trade (that’s becoming less and less dreadful as Steven Adams blossoms into a Kiwi warrior, but still). You can excuse all of those things and easily land at the following place: We should have won at least one title, it’s amazing that we didn’t, I can’t give up on this team yet. Admirable and understandable, especially for someone as loyal to fans and teammates as Durant has been. - The Ringer, June, 2016 https://theringer.com/kevin-durant-thunder-conundrum-4b1689d4002c


**Also keep in mind other teams had a chance at Kevin (Well, at least in thoery**

> The Thunder, Spurs and Warriors already have meetings set up, according to a report from The Vertical. The Los Angeles teams want face-to-face talks. So do Miami, Boston, Houston, and New York.
> Another agent thinks, in the case of Durant, the club that wants to pry him away from the Thunder “needs to be a good team, in a better market with a better chance to win than OKC.”
> “So Golden State and Miami become the only real players,” the agent said. “It's too hard to justify a move to Los Angeles (Lakers) or New York because they are not close to winning. Houston's out.”
> Durant won't be touring city-to-city. The Vertical reported that Durant and his representation will host meetings at an undisclosed location in NYC, the homebase of Roc Nation. LeBron James had a similar strategy in 2010 when he set up meetings for teams to come to him in northeastern Ohio.
> Not since James has a free agent been as highly coveted as Durant, to be able to control the entire tempo and pace of free agency. Another agent, however, thinks Durant's free agency will be different from James' in one regard: Durant isn't playing general manager. - NewsOk, June, 2016 http://newsok.com/article/5506480



**...and there you have it.**

The Warriors built up this so called ""Super Team"" by players that they drafted. Steph Curry was a first round pick, but there were still mixed feelings about him when he was drafted. Thompson was heralded, but people were worried about the weed arrest. Alot of people thought that neither one these players would be Stars. The trade of Monta Ellis for Bogut and others, was ridiculed at the time. Even I questioned that, because Ellis was really good at the time.  The Warriors go the playoffs two straight years , only to have Mark jackson be fired. At the time, I hated it. I thought it was stupid. I thought that the Warriors would regress because of this. Of course that was wrong. 

The Warriors have also picked up decent free agents along the way like Andre Iguodala and Shawn Livingston. Both ended up being great additions. The Warriors built their core through the draft and supplemented that through smart , veteran Free Agent picks. 

> Andre Iguodala won’t ever win an NBA championship until he’s paid correctly and plays with truly better players than himself on offense. It’s inconvenient for whatever team overpays him this summer, but it’s the truth. - HuffPost, July, 2013  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jake-fischer/the-incovenient-truth-abo_b_3530424.html



> Livingston is a beast of a defender, capable of handling both guard spots and most small forwards. His length, physicality and smarts make him yet another fantastic wing stopper on a Golden State roster that already has one of the league's best in Andre Iguodala.
> Slotting him into backcourt lineups alongside Stephen Curry will allow the Dubs to hide their franchise point guard on the weakest available matchup. And if the Dubs want to get particularly nasty on defense, they can put a flat-out-terrifying combination of Livingston, Iguodala, Draymond Green and Andrew Bogut on the floor together. - Bleacher Report, July, 2014 http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2116632-does-shaun-livingston-signing-make-klay-thompson-more-expendable-for-warriors

The Warriors got to the state that they in by making shrewd moves. Fortunately for them , these moves paid off. Trades, Free Agents, Draft picks, Coach firings, it all could have went either way. This was not a team that went out and constructed a Big 3 in Free Agency. They drafted and groomed their Big 3 organically. Yes, they added Kevin Durant, but Durant had other suitors. He talked to other teams who did not do enough or have enough to wow him. The Warriors had the cap space and they signed the FREE agent. 

There was a void. Harrison Barnes was that void. We already know how bad he was in the Finals. The Warriors wanted to be able to beat the Cavs, so they got better. Kevin Durant is available and the job of every team is to constantly improve. The Warriors would be doing a disservice to themselves and their fans if they did not pursue him. He was free to choose and there was nothing wrong with this. 

There are fans who are now complaining and saying that the league needs to do something, but the Warriors did nothing wrong and Durant did nothing wrong. The Durant signing was there biggest Free Agent signing in years. This was a team built through the draft and I can't stress that enough.  I keep repeating that when Curry, Klay and Draymond were drafted  most did not see any of them being stars, so lets not act like these were overly hyped draft picks.

**The Warriors built their team the right way Its almost similar to how Jerry West helped build the Lakers in the late 90s/early 00s and then to go to the Warriors in 2011**

> After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award.[49] By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West laid down the fundamentals of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.[1] On May 19, 2011, West joined the Golden State Warriors as an executive board member, reporting directly to new owners Joe Lacob and Peter Guber.[52][53] This role also came with an undisclosed minority ownership stake in the team.[54] In 2015, the Warriors won their first championship in 40 years; the championship was the seventh earned by West while serving as a team executive. - Jerry West, Wikipedia

the bottom line is, if other NBA teams want to win, then maybe they should follow the blueprint of the Golden State Warriors. You have a clear vision that you follow, you make smart draft picks, you build team chemistry even at the expense of trading favorite players (Ellis), you put smart basketball people in key positions in your franchise (West), You take chances at the Coaching position even if it doesnt make sense at the time (Kerr), you take chances and add players other teams dont  really want (Iggy, Livingston, Javelle), You make your team as a good as possible by going after and acquiring the best player in Free Agency when you have the chance (Durant).  None of this ""ruins"" the league.",0.52,controversial,6/4/17 17:16

Let's not forget that the NBA broke out internationally because of team USA complete and utter dominance in the 92' Olympics and how Jordan was far and beyond everybody else in term of Basketball. Jordan who by the way only lost 5 series in his entire playoffs career and has a record of 114-54 in the postseason, and never lost a final.

Also, the reaction when Germany beat Brazil in brazil 7-1 wasn't ""OMG THIS SO BORING"", it was a shock but Germany was celebrated for their epic performance. While the Cavs who have put on an amazing display have been hearing nothing but ""EAST IS WEAK"" for the whole season.

666,"The ""I don't owe anyone shit"" quote is taken completely out of context and people claiming Kyrie is hinting at joining the Knicks are just trying to push an narrative that will get the most attention and clicks",0,am5xvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/am5xvx/the_i_dont_owe_anyone_shit_quote_is_taken/,82,1549079001,"Kyrie said this bit in the SAME exact interview:

>“I still have confidence in Boston and what they can promise for the future and what we have in terms of pieces,” he said. “That’s what excited me a lot about the beginning of the season, was the opportunity to come into this season really just doing what we planned on doing.  
>  
>“Set a goal and go after it and then see what happens at the end of the season. That was the plan before and that’s still the plan now. Obviously Boston’s still at the head of that race. That’s just where it stands.”

When asked about the Knicks:

>“I respect the Knicks organization,” Irving said. “Obviously they’re making moves to position themselves for this upcoming summer. I wish them the best.”

&#x200B;

And as we all know is full ""don't owe shit"" quote:

>“I spent the last eight years trying to do what everybody else wanted me to do in terms of making my decisions and trying to validate through the media, through other personnel, managers, anybody in this business,” Irving said. “And I don’t owe anybody s–t.”

&#x200B;

Everything he said to seems pretty much to be the same attitude he's had for a while. Him not coming out and SPECIFICALLY reiterating his commitment to re-sign in Boston could just as easily be him getting annoyed with the press (which he talked about in a podcast last summer), as it is him saying he's going to leave Boston to team up in NY with KD.

So for all you guys relishing in this apparent ""dysfunction"" in Boston, idk what else to say besides there's a good chance you're probably wrong.

**Atlanta Hawks**

With Blazers

Receive- Anfernee Simmons, Gary Trent Jr. 2019 2nd rd pick

Give- Taurean Prince 

Reasoning- The Blazers add a wing to take minutes from Turner and Moe Harkless, who have both been questionable. Prince gives them a solid defensive presence. The Hawks add 2 young pieces and help the tankathon, Prince likely isn't in their future plans anyway.

**Boston Celtics**

With Pelicans

Receive- Anthony Davis, Wesley Johnson

Give- Jaylen Brown, Kings 2019 1st, Clippers 2019 1st, Al Horford, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojelye 

Reasoning, I understand this trade is ridiculous, but finding a trade for the Celtics is really hard when they don't have any holes. Exploring trades with Rozier is kind of difficult because he's the only bench PG for the Celtics and they need the depth. For the Pelicans, this deal would avoid a long turnover process and you get the deal in before it turns into a Jimmy Butler to move up 6 spots in the draft and some filler, or boogie cousins for a centerpiece around Buddy Hield

**Brooklyn Nets**

with 76ers

Receive- Fultz, Korkmaz

Give- Dudley, Dinwiddie

Reasoning- Dinwiddie is expiring and the Nets get a high potential prospect for pretty cheap, all things considered, they need to see if DRuss can handle a full-time pg role before they pay him anyway. For the 76ers, they get a much needed shooter and just added bench scoring with dinwiddie, or he could start, but I would like to see Dinwiddie on a playoff team.

**Charlotte Hornets**

With Suns

Receive- Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges, Ryan Anderson

Give- Kemba Walker, Nicholas Batum

Reasoning- Although I don't think they trade Kemba, and there's a good case for why they shouldn't; the Hornets are capitalizing on Kemba's highest value as they not only pull 2 young guys with good potential. Even if Jackson has been bad so far, he still has a decent ceiling and Bridges is a young asset. They also save 4m in cap room the next 2 years and get out of the contract 1 year sooner with the Anerson for Batum swap. The Suns fill out they're backcourt with a dominant scorer. 

**Chicago Bulls**

With Wizards

Receive- Kelly Oubre Jr.

Give- Bobby Portis

All about needs here, as the Wizards need to fill a hole at big man, especially how bad they are rebounding right now and the Bulls, although they don't need wing scoring, Oubre isn't an awful defender and probably gives them a better SF option that Justin Holiday, Denzel Valentine or Chandler Hutchinson.

**Cleveland Cavaliers**

With Houston Rockets

Receive- Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss

Give- George Hill

For the Cavs, they get to essentially shave a year off of Hill's contract with Knight and Chriss expiring, also they get to see if they want to hold on to Chriss, who could be a rotational guy in the future. For the Rockets, they get a much needed consistent 3rd ball-handler, they can stop forcing MCW out there.

**Detroit Pistons**

With Charlotte Hornets

Receive- Kemba Walker

Give- Ish Smith, Luke Kennard, Khyri Thomas, 2019 1st, 2021 1st (top 3 protected)

For the Pistons, they get their big 3 so to speak and give themselves a 2nd legitimate scoring option. For the Horents, they get a young shooter in Kennard, but also 2 1sts that can help them rebuild once they get out of these awful contracts, a pistons team in 2021 could be very bad if Blake doesn't keep this season up and who knows if Kemba stays in Detroit. 

**Indiana Pacers**

with Wizards

Receive- Bradley Beal, Kelly Oubre Jr.

Give- Myles Turner, Cory Joseph, Thaddeus Young, 2019 1st

Reasoning- The Pacers seem to not have anyone adding a ton of production behind Oladipo, Sabonis and the occasional Bogdanovic momentum 3 ball. Adding Beal would give them another deep scoring option on a good contract. The Wizards pull out a solid young center that can be a piece for the future and possibly help Wall right some of his wrongs, cause I think losing Gortat hurts Wall more than the public, or Wall, thinks. They also get a 1st in the deal and keep relevance this season with 3 guys that can play.

**Miami Heat**

With Rockets

Give- James Johnson, Justice Winslow

Get, Brandon Knight, 2019 1st

Reasoning- Heat get out of the Johnson deal in style, acquiring a 1st round pick in the process, Knight being expiring doesn't really hurt them in the long run and I don't know if they planned on resigning Winslow anyway. For the Rockets, they get deeper to start and add 2 guys that can defend how they like, in a way replacing Trevor Ariza, obviously not quite the shooters like Ariza was at points but regardless adding wing defenders is never a bad idea.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

With Magic

Give- Tony Snell, 2019 1st

Get- Evan Fournier

Reasoning- For the bucks, it's fairly obvious, they add another wing scoring option that can fit directly into their lineup. Fournier might be having an off year so far but he's a pretty solid guard that can add a good bit to their lineup, possibly can play the Korver role in Bud's offense. For the Magic, they don't really need Fournier, he's also at 17m and taking Snell cuts 7m off of that, adding the 1st round pick is exciting for the team as well. 

**New York Knicks**

With Kings

Give- Courtney Lee, 2020 1st

Get- Iman Shumpert, Harry Giles

Reasoning- For the Knicks, they get more money, for what they hope is a big offseason by unloading Courtney Lee's 2 year contract and they add a decent young guy in Harry Giles. For the Kings, they get to watch as the Knicks swing and miss on every free agent in 2019 and are back in the lottery in 2020. 

**Orlando Magic**

With Pelicans

Give- Terrance Ross

Receive- Soloman Hill, 2019 2nd

Reasoning- A small trade here that nets the Magic a 2nd rounder and gives the Pelicans some added 3pt shooting. Hill and Ross are both expiring, so the money isn't really impacted either way.

**Philadephia 76ers**

With Bulls

Give- Markelle Fultz

Get- Bobby Portis, Cam Payne

Reasoning- The 76ers likely can solve their issue at back up center with adding Portis and open up enough money this offseason for a max player. Probably the most they'll get for Fultz. Cam Payne just to make salaries work, he's an expiring anyway. The Bulls just lose a piece that probably wasn't going to help them win this season and get a lottery ticket in Markelle

**Toronto Raptors**

With Trail Blazers

Give- Norman Powell

Get- Al Faruq-Aminu, Caleb Swanigan

Reasoning- Making a trade for the Raptors is very difficult because they're filled out, but Norm has been a question mark this year and I suppose getting a consistent stretch 4/wing helps them and Swanigan can provide depth at the big spot if they're in a pinch. The Blazers, get a wing to take minutes away from Turner and Harkless.

**Washington Wizards**

With Heat

Give- John Wall

Get- Goran Gragic

Reasoning- The Wizards escape the Wall contract in the final year they can while likely not dropping off too much and who knows, possibly new blood can help the team turn something around. For the Heat they give Wall a fresh a start, they seem to be a team content with being decent and just hovering in the playoffs until something breaks for them and Wall could help give them that, even at a bad contract, you don't get a player at Wall's caliber any cheaper and I think he could be better in Miami than Washington.

**Dallas Mavericks**

With Heat

Give- J.J. Barea, Ray Spalding

Get- Justice Winslow

Reasoning- The Mavs need a wing defender, they simply are lacking someone that can lock up the wing consistently and although they hate to move Barea, They open up minutes for Brunson and still have Devin Harris. Meanwhile the Heat don't have a true back up point, Tyler Johnson can run it, but their team would look a lot better if he could play off ball full time. 

**Denver Nuggets**

With Grizzlies

Give- Mason Plumlee, Jarred Vanderbilt

Get- Garret Temple, Marshon Brooks, Ivan Rabb

Reasoning- I couldn't find a trade for the Nuggets for the life of me, please forgive this trade, I guess they get a 2nd ball handler in Garret Temple, but like I said I really could not find a logical trade for the nuggets

**Golden State Warriors**

With Cavaliers

Give- Quinn Cook, Jacob Evans, 2019 1st

Get- Larry Nance Jr.

Reasoning, Nance gives them an athletic 4 that can play the 5 in a pinch and possible protection if Draymond leaves for more depth at that spot. Losing the 30th pick, Quinn Cook and Jacob Evans doesn't really hurt them and the Cavs push toward tanking and add another draft pick to help fill out their roster next year for what should be another tankathon.

**Houston Rockets**

With Knicks

Give- Brandon Knight, Zhou Qi, 2019 1st

Get- Tim Hardaway Jr.

Reasoning- The Rockets need more rotational guys, if Hardaway can simply play in the playoffs for them he helps them immensely, he can be the spot up shooter that melo wasn't. For the Knicks they open up a lot of money this upcoming season and get a late 1st, which gives them the ability to turn this offseason into a big one.

**Los Angeles Clippers**

With Trail Blazers

Give- Patrick Beverley, Sindarious Thornwell

Get- Zach Collins, Jake Layman

Reasoning- The Clippers are another tough team to find a trade for cause their plan is pretty well laid out at this point. However this trade gives them another young piece to their already rich core. And for the Blazers they get a much needed defending guard and a ball handler definitely doesn't hurt them.

**Los Angeles Lakers**

With Suns

Give- Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, 2019 1st

Get- Devin Booker

Reasoning- Yes this is absurd, yes this will never happen but it actually has some logic on paper. It's hard to make a reasonable trade for the lakers right now because so many guys are restricted from trades due to being signed recently. So the Lakers obviously get a great young player who will be able to get his own 30 and take the load off of LeBron but i'm sure thats not the part that fans are upset about. The Suns might see that Ingram has been close to as good as Booker the past 2 seasons and Kuzma is what Kuzma is but is still young, they get to widen their young core. I know they would never do this but it's more of a thought provoking trade cause I can't make a real one based on reasons thrown out at the beginning.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

With Mavericks

Give- Chandler Parsons, 2021 1st

Get- Wesley Matthews, J.J. Barea

Reasoning- The Grizzlies get out of the Parsons contract and open up their room for someone next season, and add J.J. Barea this season, an improvement over Mack. Matthews isn't bad either. The Mavericks could use an extra 1st after losing one to go get Doncic.

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

With Hornets

Get- Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lamb

Give- Tyus Jones, Taj Gibson, 2019 1st

Reasoning- T-Wolves get a star and complete their lineup with Kemba, Wiggins, Covington, Saric and Towns. Improving from Teague. And they add Lamb as a solid piece. The Hornets add a young player, and expiring contract and what should be a draft pick in the early 20's possibly late teens, not a bad haul for the UConn guard.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

With Knicks

Give- Soloman Hill, Cheick Diallo, 2019 1st

Give- Tim Hardaway Jr.

Reasoning- The Kicks get a 1st for a contract they probably don't want all that much now, and the Pelicans get a good wing to help outside. It helps possibly convince AD to stay as well. 

**Oklahoma City Thunder**

With Kings and Spurs

Give- Andre Roberson to Spurs, Hamidou Diallo, 2020 & 2021 2nd to Kings

Get- Bodgan Bogdanovich

Spurs give Patty Mills to Kings

Reasoning- This is assuming the Kings come back down into the mid to low lottery, but they add Diallo, who honestly has been pretty decent in limited minutes, adding 2 2nds and getting 9m this offseason due to Patty Mills expiring. The Thunder's defense has been good without Roberson and I think they're going to want to continue giving Ferguson minutes, adding a shooter really helps them and they can trot out a much better starting 5. The Spurs need something defensively and badly, they rank 29th in defensive rtg and Roberson you'd imagine helps that, Derrick White and Bryn Forbes can handle PG for a bit at least. Derozan would probably be the primary ball handler though.

**Phoenix Suns**

With Pacers

Give- T.J. Warren

Get- Thaddeus Young, 2020 1st

Reasoning- The suns get a draft pick that probably won't be high but still adds an asset, I don't know if Warren exactly fits with their time table. Young has had a bad season so far and if you're the Pacers, Warren is a very versatile forward that can score pretty easily. He helps their chances this season a lot.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

With Nets

Give- Al-Faruq Aminu, Wade Baldwin, 2019 2nd

Get- D'Angelo Russell

Reasoning- This is assuming the Nets don't plan on bringing back Russell, which I don't think they do and he goes elsewhere this summer, so at least they get something of value for him. Baldwin is a young asset and a 2nd round pick never hurt, also this is a assuming they aren't part of the playoff picture in the near future. For the Blazers, they finally get a good bench guard where they are lacking heavily, losing aminu sucks, cause I like Aminu, but they still have Zach Collins and Leonard, who play that 4 spot a lot. 

**Sacramento Kings**

With Rockets

Give- Willy Cauley-Stien

Get- Marquese Chriss, Zhou Qi

Reasoning- The kings definitely aren't bringing back Cauley-Stien anyway, so why not turn him into 2 more young guys for your team? also helps with the whole tanking thing, assuming they will be back there this season. If they continue how they have been this trade isn't logical. For the Rockets, they are mediocre in points in the paint allowed and at the very least Cauley-Stien is an option to help that without giving up much at all for him.

**San Antonio Spurs**

With Trail Blazers

Give- LaMarcus Aldridge

Get- Evan Turner, Zach Collins, Wade Baldwin, 2019 1st, 2021 2nd

Reasoning- If the Spurs start to falter, they might not want to be in that Aldridge deal for long, and adding Collins, Baldwin and a 1st can help restart this. The Spurs are hard to find a trade for due to their recently signed players and not clear direction quite yet so the trade is more so of an idea that I think they could pursue. 

**Utah Jazz**

With Wizards

Give- Ricky Rubio, Thabo Sefolosha, Tony Bradley, 2019, 2021 1st

Get- Bradley Beal

Reasoning- Jazz get a solid extra scorer, in an offense that seems stagnant if Mitchell is cold. Mitchell moving to point could be good for the offense as Rubio has seen plenty of troubles this season and we have seen the Mitchell at PG work in the playoffs last season. I think it gives their lineup a lot more options. For the Wizards, if they want to blow it up, this might be the way to do it. They get to take away all of Beal's money while adding 2 1st round picks. 

&#x200B;

So thats it, tell me how bad these are, and maybe which ones you could see actually going through, I realize that a lot of these likely have some problems in them with who gets what but they are all trades that can legally happen under the NBA trading rules, through ESPN trade machine.

668,James Harden vs Steph Curry: Who’s better?,1,812qbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/812qbt/james_harden_vs_steph_curry_whos_better/,207,1519908546,"James Harden is this years MVP, has an argument for Curry’s first one, and Russ’s last year. He is doing unspeakable things to NBA teams and taking his team to the number 1 seed over the more talented Warriors team. Also wears Wesley Johnson’s ankles as a necklace. Harden is twice as good as Steph at drawing fouls and contact, a very valuable asset in a player because it puts the opposing teams best defenders in foul trouble. He leads the league in three point makes and is shooting 39% at the same volume of 3s as Curry. He absolutely stuffs the stat sheet in ways Curry cannot do, rebounding, assisting and scoring much more than Curry over the last 4 years. He’s also only assisted on 30% of his baskets, while Curry hovers at around 60% assisted.

Curry is the definition of efficiency. He has the highest true shooting percentage of a guard of all time currently. He’s second in the league in 3 point makes, but on 3% higher efficiency than Harden and about 6 fewer games played. He’s got two MVPs, one unanimous and has seen the NBA Finals 3 times, conquering them twice in the process. He consistently leads the league in box +/-, RPM, VORP, and a slew of other advanced stats. His reputation as the greatest shooter of all time gives him a special gravity that opens up the floor for his teammates that not many in NBA history can make claim to. Like James, Curry also owns Wesley Johnson, but as more of a subset of owning the entire Clippers franchise since 2014. 

I don’t think the answer is as clear cut as many here make it seem.",0.5,controversial,3/1/18 4:49

670,Lakers should swallow Carmelo’s $28M for OKC’s 2022 and 2024 first-rounders,0,8v7t6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8v7t6a/lakers_should_swallow_carmelos_28m_for_okcs_2022/,148,1530451259,"The Thunder can’t trade a first-rounder prior to that year because they sent their ‘20 first-rounder elsewhere.  
 
The Lakers no longer have a great second max contract option this summer since CP3, PG13, and Durant have all re-upped.  

They sign Lebron for a max 1+1 and he gets to buddy up with Carmelo for a year.  They don’t make the Kawhi trade, and use it as a feeling-out year to see which of the young guys fit well next to Bron, and how well Walton and Bron fit.  Low pressure, low expectations in year 1.  This is a non-playoff year and the Lakers will have their own ‘19 pick.  

Then in the summer of ‘19 they re-sign Lebron, sign Kawhi to a max, and use those two Thunder future first-rounders and their own future first rounders add a third elite player that is already under contract somewhere else.  

At that point - summer of ‘19 - Deng’s deal would only have one year remaining, and cap space opens wide up next year with the cap going up 7 million and many bad deals going off the books.  The Lakers could use the final year of Deng’s deal and those future Thunder first-rounders to add another elite player under contract with another team (an opted in and traded Jimmy Butler or Khris Middleton for example).  

This plan would mean the Lakers were probably a non-playoff team in 18-19 with Lebron and Carmelo, but set themselves up to be loaded in 19-20:

Lebron, Kawhi, Jimmy Butler or Middleton, AND all their current young guys, who still wouldn’t be expensive yet.  

The Thunder would do that Carmelo deal because it would save them $100M+ in repeater tax bills next year.  It saves them more money to completely clear Carmelo’s salary than it would to buy him out or stretch him.  Plus Carmelo is headed to a desirable destination and playing with one of his best friends.",0.49,controversial,7/1/18 6:20
671,"[OC] Now that the hype has died: Why the Hack-A Rules Make Basketball A Worse Sport, and ""Learn to Make Free Throws"" is a Terrible Argument.",6,3daaac,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3daaac/oc_now_that_the_hype_has_died_why_the_hacka_rules/,264,1436928489,"I want to start this off with a question: how would you rank basketball, football, hockey, soccer, billiards, darts, bowling and rowing in terms of quality? This could be from a player, coach, or purely academic perspective. Please do not include the potential for beer involved in billiards, darts or bowling as a factor.

I would be willing to bet that most people here would rank basketball, football, hockey and soccer in the top 4. People like team sports. People also like sports that involve a myriad of skills and actions. The more variables that affect success in a game, provided those variables work together in an interpret-able and logical way, the more fun it is. I am not stating that as fact, but as an opinion that it probably does not take a leap of faith for most of you to agree with. 

Basketball is a game that involves so many skills. Jump shooting, Set shooting, lay-ups, dunks, passing, dribbling, rebounding, posting up... I could go on for a long time. But not every player can do each one at the same level. What makes basketball beautiful is the team-work can make imperfect players play the game at near perfect levels. 

- Dirk Nowitzki? That can't rebound well or protect the rim for shit. Dirk Nowitzki and Tyson Chandler? World champions. 

- Steph Curry? Guy is great on one side of the ball, but he's so weak he gets beat just as bad on the other end. Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green? Well, shit, we don't have *4 guys* who can torch him. 

- LeBron James? He is the most rounded player ever, but his jump shot is pretty inconsistent - he's only a good scorer if he is getting to the rack. LeBron James, Chris Bosh, Shane Battier, Dwyane Wade and Mario Chalmers? How you gonna stop that man when there is nobody even near the rack?!?!

You can probably see my point. Every player, even LeBron, has strengths and weakness. The beauty of basketball is finding a way to leverage peoples' greatness and cover for their weakness to put the best possible product on the floor. That's why I love it, at least. 

Because of dumb, outdated fouling rules, there is one skill that a team cannot find a way to mask. DeAndre Jordan is probably just as bad at dribbling as he is at shooting, but that doesn't keep him out of the game because his team is full of playmakers. Ricky Rubio couldn't finish a happy meal, but as long as his teammates can they have a chance. But if a player can't make FTs the other team can eliminate the relevance of every other skill in the game. You can't even stop the other team from putting your player on the line by not giving him the ball. You literally have to take him out of the game. How ridiculous is that? 

People talk about DeAndre and Dwight as if they are some extreme outliers that are the only source of the issue. As if its a sheer matter of practice that is holding him back, and that's on him. But there have always been and always will be lots of good basketball players that struggle with FTs, as there are lots who struggle with defense.  Most of these guys aren't factors in playoff series so they don't face hack-a too often, but if they were the Plumlees, Drummond, Whiteside, Sanders, Perkins, Ed Davis, Mahinmi would all face the issue. Dwight and DeAndre are so damn good at everything else that they are the only two players whose lack of touch doesn't prevent them from being stars on playoff teams. They aren't being punished for being outliers for their bad FT shooting, they are being punished for being too good at everything else (or some other things, more accurately). 

Basketball will always be a sport where great teams are more than the sum of their parts because teammates can make up for any weaknesses. If you support current Hack-A-Shaq rules, you are effectively saying that applies to everything except FT shooting.

If you really feel that way, go watch darts. Its basically the same fucking thing. 

EDIT: Thanks for the gold and thanks for all the good discussion. It has come to my attention that the reason people are so committed to the ""learn to make you free throws"" defense is because people think that FTs are just a matter of fundamentals and practice, unlike many other skills which require certain genetic traits. Maybe this is the case because a lot of  people don't ever get into basketball without playing it to a degree, and most average height people don't play much unless they have a pretty good natural shooting stroke. I dunno, that seems far-fetched, but its gotta be something.

As a 6'8 (out of shoes, so NBA 6'10"") forward who is wet from mid range and even 3, but has always struggled from the line, I assure you that is not the case. FT shooting is definitely something you can improve, but the range is absolutely different for different people. While DJ's 43% seems particularly low, a lot of really good players have been poor FT shooters and to question all of their work ethic is pretty presumptuous.",0.52,controversial,7/14/15 19:48
672,2020 final standings predictions,1,dh1krt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dh1krt/2020_final_standings_predictions/,58,1570946314,"I did a standings prediction last year. Here's mine for this year.

#Western Conference

1. **Houston Rockets**, 58-24. This Russ/Harden combo is going underrated, and the Rockets have potential for another magnificent regular season like their 65-17 season two years ago. That probably won't happen again, but CP3 -> Russ upgrade is still pretty significant, both because CP3 is starting to decline and because he has had availability issues. Russ helps to mitigate some issues and is good on defense as well as athleticism. The Rockets have also returned their core players (Gordon/Tucker/Capela/etc.) so there is still some continuity. 
2. **Denver Nuggets**, 56-26. Denver is high-key really good, and MPJ is looking great in preseason. Unless he proves that he can stay healthy, he won't be a difference maker, but who knows at this point? The Nuggets' young players should hopefully continue to grow, and hopefully Jamal doesn't go full Wiggins after securing the bag.
3. **Utah Jazz**, 55-27. The Jazz have upgraded significantly this offseason by adding a borderline All-Star in Conley and then also adding Bojan, who was a big factor for the Pacers staying afloat after Oladipo's injury last year. With a good amount of depth, the Jazz should be in the upper tier of the regular season teams.
4. **Golden State Warriors**, 52-30. Note that this ranking assumes a healthy Curry (75+ games) and that Klay returns after All-Star break. If not, they will be a lot lower. With healthy Curry, the Warriors are still contenders. Expect him to put up insane numbers this year and carry harder than any non-Harden player has done in recent memory. They could pull a trade for D'Lo since I don't expect him to mesh that well with GS's system when Klay comes back, but it depends on how he does.
5. **Los Angeles Lakers**, 51-31. One extended injury to LeBron forcing another January vacation or to Anthony Day to Davis could throw the Lakers out of the playoffs. The Lakers will practice some load management either way to keep their stars healthy for the playoffs, so don't expect them to be in the top part of the standings. Don't let their record deceive you, though -- come playoff time, the Lakers are firmly in the upper echelon of the league, with an outstanding duo (if healthy) and good complimentary pieces.
6. **Los Angeles Clippers**, 50-32. The Clippers will manage the hell out of Kawhi's load after seeing how that worked out for the Raptors last year. He'll probably play 60 games or so, and given that Paul George will miss probably a month or so at the start of the season, we will not see the full extent of what the Clippers can do until the playoffs. Like the Lakers, don't let their record deceive you. Fully healthy and non-load managing, the Clippers are contenders.
7. **Dallas Mavericks**, 47-35. Their record also depends on health and load management as KP comes back from his ACL injury. However, the roster is solid enough to keep them afloat even with some management, as Luka has proven to be able to carry the team at points, and if we get a jump from him, this seeding is definitely realistic for the Mavs. The bench is also fairly deep, especially with Point God JJ Barea's early return from injury. The Mavs will surprise people, and could even have two All-Stars.
8. **Portland Trail Blazers**, 45-37. This last spot is a tossup between several good teams, but Portland, with the best player among all of them, gets the nod. Lillard is still an elite PG and should keep the team rolling despite the loss of Nurkic and some roster overhaul. I don't like a lot of their roster moves this offseason (losing Kanter is big for them, who stepped up majorly after Nurkic went down, Whiteside and old af Pau won't fill that role much), though, so I don't expect them to do as well as they did last year.
9. **San Antonio Spurs**, 44-38. I keep thinking that it's finally gonna happen, but Pop proves me wrong each year. This year, unfortunately, is probably when that magical run ends. The west has too many teams for the Spurs to keep defying odds each time, although still expect the Spurs to have a winning record, of course. DeMar is great but not that All-NBA player that took the Raptors to the #1 seed anymore, and LMA is very good for his age but how long can he keep it up? The rest of the roster is good, with a lot of solid pieces, but not good enough to be top 8 this year, most likely.
10. **Sacramento Kings**, 42-40. The Kings will push through with a winning record for the first time in quite a while, but as is the case with the Spurs, the west is too stacked for them to make it into the playoffs. I do think the Kings need another piece to add to their current core before they can expect to contend for the playoffs, so it might be better off for them to stay in the lottery this year, honestly.
11. **New Orleans Pelicans**, 38-44. The Pelicans are good on paper, but giving plenty of their key minutes to young players/rookies will probably not do them very well when trying to make a playoff push. This is a playoff team in the east for sure (probably on Orlando's tier, with a good crowd of young players and established vet All-Stars in Jrue/Vuc) but in the west, not so much. I'm excited to see Zion throughout the regular season, and I think he can be massive for them going forward, both literally and figuratively.
12. **Oklahoma City Thunder**, 35-47. The roster looks alright, but let's be honest: Gallo is trade bait and will certainly not be on the team anymore post-trade deadline, and same deal with Adams. CP3 will be on the team solely because his contract is an albatross, and OKC would have to part with assets to acquire him unless it's for Wall or Wiggins straight up. Now that we mention it... Wiggins on OKC would be interesting. Would he be a permanent MVP-level player now? But either way, the Thunder are not a playoff team, but certainly not bad. They will keep close to .500 pre-trade deadline, most likely.
13. **Phoenix Suns**, 31-51. I'm hyped to see Ayton this year, and I think he could continue developing into a true beast that makes people stop asking why the Suns didn't draft Luka. The roster is improved from last year, no doubt, with the additions of Saric and Rubio. These are not season-changing players, but in the case of the Suns, who need a PG desperately, Rubio may make a huge impact that launches the team past the 30-win mark.
14. **Minnesota Timberwolves**, 28-54. Let's be honest, this team is ass outside of KAT and RoCo. The Butler trade was a huge mistake -- if they didn't make it, they'd be working with KAT, LaVine, and Lauri to build around (and maybe Wiggins might be good in this hypothetical timeline), but now they are straight up wasting KAT's early years. The Wolves will probably take this season to grab another high draft pick, because they are probably not going to sniff the playoffs this year. Without KAT, this team is probably worst in the league.
15. **Memphis Grizzlies**, 25-57. Bad this year, but with a bright future. The roster is also bad, although they have multiple young studs in Ja, JJJ, and Valanciunas. They will probably finish worst in the west without a Booker or KAT-level player to carry them out of the cellar. It would also be nice to convey the protected (top 6) pick to Boston this year so they can go forward without any pick obligations, but if they vault to #1 or something, they certainly won't complain.

#Eastern Conference

1. **Milwaukee Bucks**, 57-25. The Bucks are a deep team, and Giannis is looking to go on a revenge tour after getting bounced in the ECF. The team is worse than last year due to the loss of Brogdon, but made up for it in part with some decent signings (other Lopez, Korver, Wes Matthews), so they should still be elite in the regular season. 
2. **Philadelphia 76ers**, 54-28. The 76ers are going to be very good, but I think they are being a little overrated here on r/nba. The Bucks are still better all-around, and losing Butler will be big for Philly, who relied on him a lot to close games. The defense will be very good, but I'm skeptical of their ability to earn the #1 seed.
3. **Boston Celtics**, 50-32. If the Celtics have a fully healthy Hayward, they can challenge one of the top two teams in the playoffs. If he's similar to last year, not so much. The Celtics are very weak in the middle, and expect them to swing a trade for some good center this year. Other than that, they are probably not going to be better than last year.
4. **Miami Heat**, 47-35. The Heat will be pretty good with Butler -- not contenders, but due to how weak the east is, they will get a good seed. Their roster is solid this year, although I don't have much else to say about them other than that they will be good. 
5. **Orlando Magic**, 46-36. I'm excited to see Fultz hopefully have a bounce-back season and lead the Magic to a good seed in the playoffs. Isaac will continue to progress, as will AG and hopefully Bamba. Vucevic is still an All-Star, and will probably repeat as one if the Magic are this high when it comes time for voting. I think the Magic are a dark horse and could go as high as the 3rd seed if everything goes right.
6. **Toronto Raptors**, 45-37. While the defending champions, the Raptors did lose, of course, their best player and another very important piece to their success, so they will probably not have a top seed, but are going to return to the playoffs nonetheless. They may part with some of their non-Lowry core (Ibaka, Gasol) in trades if they get a good enough offer.
7. **Indiana Pacers**, 44-38. With Oladipo out for some time, don't expect the Pacers to be as high as they were pre-injury last year (3rd). Losing Bojan also hurts a lot, but Brogdon and Warren helps a bit. If Oladipo makes a timely return, the Pacers should be back in the playoffs, although if he stays out too long, they are in danger.
8. **Brooklyn Nets**, 44-38. Also a good team, but without KD, I don't expect them to land too high. If KD is back in the playoffs, then things could change, but I don't think the Nets will risk it by bringing him back early. Now if he was healthy the whole season at 100%, the Nets would probably be a 2nd seed.
9. **Detroit Pistons**, 43-39. The Pistons look good, but unfortunately, with 9 playoff-caliber teams in the east, one has to miss out, and it's most likely to be Detroit. Note that the 4 to 9 seeds are all within 4 games, so a lot can change with injuries. I see the top 3 as fixed, but 4-9 is fluid and there are definitely some scenarios where the Pistons can be in the picture (Magic young guys regress, Raptors suck, Oladipo takes too long to come back, Kyrie is cancer again, etc.).
10. **Chicago Bulls**, 31-51. The Bulls lost 60 games last year, so expecting a bigger jump from that is probably expecting a little too much. Regardless, they will be a lot better, with some decent offseason acquisitions as well as a full season of OPJ (who made the team look a lot better after being traded). 
11. **Atlanta Hawks**, 29-53. The Hawks are still in rebuild mode as evidenced by some of their moves (trading for Parsons, for one) and the fact that rookies and young guys will get a lot of minutes. I don't expect them to improve record-wise from last year, but they will nonetheless be fun to watch.
12. **New York Knicks**, 26-56. The New York Power Forwards will be less bad than last year, but still bad. And that's fine. You can't really expect a team giving major minutes to DSJ and Kevin Knox (among other young guys) to make the playoffs. Nonetheless, they will be fun to watch like the Hawks.
13. **Cleveland Cavaliers**, 22-60. One of the true cellar teams of the east who are not going into the season with the idea of winning games. With a Garland/Sexton backcourt, you can't really expect them to win a lot of games, either, but that's fine for now, as they are rebuilding. Maybe the god of #1 picks will be with them again.
14. **Washington Wizards**, 20-62. Also another very bad team. Outside of Beal, who's their 2nd option? Rui Hachimura? The Wizards will lose a lot of games. A lot of games, I tell you. The Wizards will hold out on bringing Wall back since there's really no point this year. 
15. **Charlotte Hornets**, 15-67. The highest PPG last season of anyone currently on the team was 10.1.

#Draft Lottery

As a bonus, I'll simulate the draft lottery using the standings above and the adjusted lottery odds.

The way I did it was by drawing out the lottery odds in the form of a table on Excel and following standard procedures by randomly tiebreaking and splitting the odds. Next, I assigned a range of values to every lottery team based on the adjusted lottery odds for this season, which are seen below. The number of possible values correspond to the number of combinations each team has in the lottery.

1. Charlotte: 1-140
2. Washington: 141-280 
3. Cleveland: 281-420
4. Memphis: 421-545
5. New York: 536-650
6. Minnesota: 651-740
7. Atlanta: 731-815
8. Chicago: 816-875
9. Phoenix: 876-920
10. OKC: 921-950
11. New Orleans: 951-970
12. Detroit: 971-985
13. Sacramento: 986-995
14. San Antonio: 996-1000

Then, I generated four random numbers using an RNG and assigned them to the #1, #2, #3, and #4 picks respectively. Here's the draft order for the outcome I generated.

1. Charlotte
2. Memphis
3. Cleveland
4. Minnesota
5. Washington
6. New York
7. and the rest stays like the pre-lottery order above

#Conclusion

Thank you for reading this.",0.5,controversial,10/12/19 22:58
673,CMV/Unpopular Opinion: Lebron isn't at fault for coaching and GM decisions.,0,8uvyri,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8uvyri/cmvunpopular_opinion_lebron_isnt_at_fault_for/,27,1530329640,"I didn't know how to neatly sum up my view in the title, so I'll explain it here more clearly. I have seen a lot of posts and comments involving Lebron, acting like he's a player-coach-GM. The common argument for him being coach is that Ty Lue doesn't do much coaching and Lebron is pretty much the leader of the team and carries the team all the way despite the lack of coaching. The argument for him being a GM is that he campaigned for teammates to get nice contracts and the GMs and owners cave in to that. In short, the basic argument is that Lebron takes over the team when he joins. That's not what I have an issue with; I think this is true. 

But I don't buy this argument: People like to act like they can put the blame on Lebron when he's dealing with bad players on his team because ""well, he campaigned for their contracts,"" or that they can put the blame on Lebron when Ty Lue makes a bad coaching decision because ""well he wanted Blatt fired and vouched for Lue."" 

[When Lebron was with the Miami Heat, he wanted Spoelstra fired.](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2611328-miami-heat-minority-owner-claims-lebron-james-wanted-erik-spoelstra-fired) Pat Riley stuck by his guy. [Hell, it even sounds like Lebron really wanted Pat Riley to take over as coach](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23088267/pat-riley-said-lebron-james-did-right-thing-left-miami-nba) but Pat Riley stood by his convictions in 2011 and let Coach Spo lead his team to two rings. And Pat Riley talks about being angry when Lebron left, and then he talks about being able to see things from Lebron's point of view and understanding why he made the decision to go back to Cleveland. And hey, Lebron got his revenge by winning a ring in Cleveland after Riley and he reportedly had a heated exchange before they left, AKA Lebron's ""extra motivation."" 

What I'm saying is, coaching is a job. Being a GM is a job. And being a player is a job that is answerable to some degree to their coach and to their GM. We, as employees, all would like to have the guy that we're comfortable with or that we respect be our coach, and we would like to be able to call the shots on how our work operates. If it were up to me, I would go into my job looking for a 4 day work-week of 10 hours rather than a 5 day work week of 8 hours. Unfortunately, I don't have the clout that Lebron James has. 

And I think that being a mature GM and a mature coach is about having that clout. [Brad Stevens, who most agree is already one of the best coaches in the league right now, talked about how he doesn't want to tank](https://www.masslive.com/celtics/index.ssf/2018/05/boston_celtics_never_tanked_pe.html). He talked about wanting to be able to have a squad where even if one person goes down, they can build around the rest and still be successful. And he proved that this season by defying expectations even though the two best on his team went down. Why do I bring this up? Because let's say if Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward or Al Horford decided to have the attitude where they walk in and say ""hey I want to fire Brad"" or say ""hey I want this contract for this guy"" and threaten to leave otherwise, Brad Stevens would try to work things out, but in the end, Danny Ainge and Brad would be able to shut the door on the conversation, let the door close on Al Horford without giving in, and not look back. 

At the end of the day, Lebron James is most definitely the best player in this league, and one of the best all time. But that doesn't make him the coach or the GM. Any good teammate is going to stick up for his boys and try to push them to get great deals and great contracts, of course! Any person would stick up for those that they like and go against those they don't like. It's up to the GM to draw the line in the sand when it comes to staffing decisions and contracts, and if that means getting in the face of Lebron James, so be it. When Gilbert supposedly says Lebron leaving would get him his team back, that's not a negative mark on Lebron- that's a negative mark on Dan Gilbert. If Lebron leaves next season and Lue starts drawing up plays and forcing the team to follow that, that's not a negative mark on Lebron, that's a negative mark on Lue for not being able to reel in his players. Phil Jackson did it with MJ and Kobe, and those guys had just as big if not bigger and more aggressive personalities than Lebron.

tl;dr: LeGM and LeCoach jokes are funny, but it's the real GM and real coach's fault if they can't stand up to one of their players, regardless of how good he is. The player shouldn't be getting the blame because the GM or coach doesn't know how to stand their ground.",0.5,controversial,6/29/18 20:34
674,Two overlooked things in the Lebron vs Jordan debate,1,7z6ubc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7z6ubc/two_overlooked_things_in_the_lebron_vs_jordan/,189,1519259578,"Tl;dr The fact that Jordan got to team up with an all time great in Scottie isn't considered enough when talking about his Championships, and Jordan didn't have to get through Duncan/Pop and this Warriors dynasty to win his. 

The Ringer is doing ""Jordan Lebron Week"" right now, and I've been reading/listening to all their coverage because as a 26 year old who just missed out on watching Jordan, its something I'm really interested in. In all their coverage however, there are two pro-Lebron points that I feel are missing that I wanted to talk about here and see what you all think.

1st: Scottie Pippen. 
Jordan played with Pippen for 9 years, and Pippen was an elite player for 7 of those. (I'm not counting his first two seasons in the league.) What I think people aren't realizing is just how elite Pippen was. Pippen made the NBA's official ""Top 50 players of all time"" list in 1996, and Bill Simmons ranked him number 24 in 2010. The only players of the same era that Simmons had ranked above Pippen were Barkley, Malone, Olajuwon, and Jordan. In the 93-94 season that Jordan didn't play, Pippen finished 3rd in MVP voting. In other words, its fair to say that Jordan played the majority of his Bulls' career, and won all of his Championships, with another top 5 player in the NBA on his team. Top 10 at worst. 

In Lebron's career, prime Dwyane Wade is the only player he has played with that you could make any argument is a top 5 player in the NBA. Worth noting, Lebron did not team up with Wade until Wade's age 29 season, and by the time Lebron's tenure in Miami ended, Wade was clearly past his prime, which anyone who watched the second Finals against San Antonio can attest to. In other words, Lebron only played with a player near Scottie Pippen's caliber for about 3 years. In those 3 years, he won 2 Championships and lost in the Finals. Can you imagine if Lebron and Wade had teamed up for 7 years of Wade's prime? In other words, if Lebron had been on Miami for the 4 years before he actually joined? Are we sure he wouldn't have 3 or 4 more Championships? I think its quite possible. Lebron was dragging Boobie Gibson to the Finals in that stretch, and Wade was winning a Championship with Shaq. 

2nd point: Who played better teams in the Finals? 
Jordan's Finals were against a 58-24 Lakers team that was 32 year old Magic and not much else, a 57-25 Trail Blazers team that was Clyde Drexler and not much else, a 62-10 Barkley led Suns team, a 64-18 Supersonics team, a 64-18 Jazz team, and a 62-20 Jazz team. 

Lebron has played a 58-24 Duncan/Ginobili/Parker Spurs team, a 57-25 Dirk Mavericks team, a 47-19 young OKC team, 58-24 Spurs team with Duncan and young Kawhi, a 62-10 Spurs team, a 67-15 Warriors team, a 73-9 Warriors team, and a 67-15 Warriors team. 

If you rank the opponents they played, the worst were probably the Mavericks and Thunder that Lebron played. The best were definitely the 3 Warriors teams Lebron played. In the middle, personally, I would put the Duncan led Spurs ahead of anyone Jordan played. Their records are a few games worse than the best teams Jordan played, but Pop always rested guys in the regular season. Duncan is one of the 10 greatest players ever, which none of Jordan's opponents can claim, and Parker/Ginobili/Kawhi and the rest of the supporting cast is very very good. Not to mention Popovich. Its arguable that the 6 Finals Lebron played vs the Spurs and Warriors featured tougher competition than any of the 6 Finals Jordan played in. It is inarguable to me that Lebron's Championship against the 73 win Warriors team, which he did without a Pippen/Wade level player (no offense Kyrie) is the most impressive Championship of them all. (He led every player on both teams in scoring/rebounds/assists/blocks and steals. Insane.) Its arguable that his Championship with Miami against San Antonio is the second most impressive Championship of them all. 

All of this is to say, comparing these two players is really hard. However, pointing to ""Jordan won 6 Championships and never lost in the Finals"" as the end all be all, is stupid. If Lebron had prime Scottie Pippen for every Finals he played in, and he got to play Stockton and Malone instead of Curry/Durant (and the rest of that stupidly loaded team) Lebron may have already surpassed 6 Championships. And he has who knows how many years left? 

Thoughts? 

P.S. If anyone from the Ringer sees this, tell Kevin O'Connor that when a podcast is billed as ""Jordan vs. Lebron"" and Chris Vernon makes an adamant case for Jordan, your role is to make the case for Lebron! Not say ""I didn't watch Jordan so I don't really know man."" Very deflating and not much of a ""Jordan vs Lebron"" debate. Love you though KOC

675,(OC)Why is everyone MASSIVELY underrating the Portland TrailBlazers?,0,bocv0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bocv0k/ocwhy_is_everyone_massively_underrating_the/,158,1557829261,"In the past 24 hours, i havent seen a team more disrespected than how the Portland Trailblazers have been. It seems like most people on this sub is writing them of and predicting a 5 or 4 game domination by the Warriors. Heres a couple factors that people have been overlooking.

1. **The Warriors are without Kevin Durant** \- KD suffered a calf strain in late game 5 against the Rockets he is out for atleast game 1 and a really high chance he could miss game 2. With KD I agree that the Warriors should be the favorites, but without much info on his injury, its going to be difficult to guess when hes coming back.
2. **Portland is the deeper team** \- So far in these playoffs the Blazers have gotten more quality minutes from their non all star caliber guards than the Warriors have. Their bench has been more than capable of holding their lead throughout these playoffs. Contributions from Rodney Hood, Seth Curry and Zach Collins off the bench have been a big factor to their post season success. I dont see the Warriors getting the same type of contributions from their bench guys. Livingston has declined a lot and its hard to imagine Jerebko going off. 
3. **A much less talented team pushed them to 6 games WITH KD** \- Yes, i know playoffs are about matchups, but there is a large ~~marginal~~  talent gap between the Blazers and Clippers. The Clippers were able to push GS to a game 6 and managed to beat them twice in their home floor. So far the Blazers have 3 road wins these playoffs two of which were against the team with the biggest homecourt advantage and highest win % at home during the regular season (Nuggets). 
4. **Guard Battle** \- Yes the Warriors have the best back court in the league, it just so happens that the Blazers have the second best back court. If there are two other guards capable of going toe to toe with the Splash Bros in scoring it is CJ and Dame Dolla. You could honestly argue that the guards from Portland have had a better post season. Klay has been super streaky on offense, but his defense has been there every game. If the Warriors try to hide Steph and not let him guard Lillard, he will most likely get posted up by Mo Harkless or Aminu just like how they did agaisnt Jamal Murray.
5. **The Blazers are playing with a big chip on their shoulders** \- There isnt another team in the playoffs that is playing with the ""coming at you"" attitude that the Blazers are playing with. 

* Damian Lillard. A player who was been overlooked most of his career until mainly last season, but then ridiculed again for his inability to secure a win against the Pelicans last playoffs. His first round seemed like a coming out party, and his lackluster second round could mean hes in for a big series. 
   * CJ McCullum. A player who has all star level talent, but has not really received much accolades in his career other than a Most Improved Player award a few years ago due to the overpopulation of elite guards in the western conference. CJ was the first player ever drafted from Lehigh University and has earned himself a spot in this league do to his yoyo-like handle and his money mid range shot.
   * Enes Kanter. A player who was named ""UNPLAYABLE"" by an ex coach and was bought out by his previous team. This post season the man has proved that he deserves play time and hes BALLIN. Hes putting up a cool 13pts, 10.5rbs with 51% FG with an eye popping 3.7 Offensive rebounds WITH A SEPARATED SHOULDER and has gone through Ramadan for the past four games.
   * Seth Curry. A player who has been living under his brothers enormous shadow. The kid has contributed some solid minutes this post season and hes looking forward to proving himself against his sibling this series.
   * Rodney Hood. A player who was thought to be out of the league because of his lack of contribution to the Cavs playoff run last year. He has been Portlands best player off the bench all playoffs and has earned the trust of the team by playing quality and important minutes this post season.

**X Factor- Kevin Durant.** Its crazy to think that a team in the western conference finals has a chance of getting back the possible best player in the world and an elite big man. If KD misses more than two games i personally feel like this is Portlands series to lose. A reason as to why i feel like Boogie wont be as big of an impact is him not being 100% healed from his tear. Also Iguodala, the dude has a knack for making game winning plays when it matters the most.

**My Prediction: Blazers in 7.** Was originally going to say 6, but the repeating champs deserve the benefit of the doubt. 

Some of you might just skip this whole post and go straight to the comments claiming im just hating on the Golden State or i dont know what im talking about, but this is my opinion. Ive enjoyed watching the Warriors whole dynasty from start because even when my team isnt in the playoffs im still love watching the NBA.",0.48,controversial,5/14/19 3:21
676,I'm sick of the Wilt Chamberlain misconceptions!,12,27l7qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/27l7qw/im_sick_of_the_wilt_chamberlain_misconceptions/,130,1402219958,"It seems like every thread when Wilt Chamberlain is brought up there are bunch of up-votes to comments which espouse the beliefs of Bill Simmons. Bill Simmons is not the ultimate authority on basketball. Bill Simmons also was not around to watch Russell or Chamberlain play. Bill simmons isn't an unbiased subjective observer who should be cited as support in a debate.     

Misconception #1     
""Wilt only dominated because of his size and era""    


Instead of analyzing the size of that era to modern times, I will instead use some other comparisons. Babe Ruth is considered by most baseball journalists to be the greatest baseball player ever. He played from 1918 to 1935 or nearly a century ago. He NEVER played a against  African Americans or latinos. He played against vastly inferior competition and yet his stats are held in high regard and no one questions his ability. I compare him to Chamberlain because they both produced stats that were exponentially higher than the competion. Ruth's numbers were so ridiculous that they have only been approached by Players who were said to be using performance enhancing drugs (Bonds). Yet no one questions the legitimacy of those numbers.    

When people think of wilt chamberlain they imagine some 60s version of shaq who just dunked on everyone. Wilt Chamberlain had a fully developed game. He had a jumpshot,  fadeaway, and shot fingerolls. He was an excellent passer as well as defender. This was in addition to his vastly superior athletic abilities. [Wilt Ultimate offensive force](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCWrGWuU2Ak)

**Misonception # 2**    
""Wilt didn't perform in the playoffs""

[Wilt Playoff Scoring](http://bkref.com/pi/shareit/VDWwH   )    
    
For Wilts career he averaged 30.1 ppg in the regular season and 22.5ppg in the playoffs. Some have used this evidence of a drop off in performance during playoff time This just simply isn't true. Wilt chamberlains career has 2 distinct halves. For the first half of his career he was a scoring machine. After this he matured into a player who was a defensive anchor and offensive facilitator. This is evidenced by a DRAMATIC decrease in FG attempted per game as well as the fact that he was a league leader in assists. In his first 4 years in the playoffs he averaged 28.3 FG attempts per game and 34.6 ppg. His next 4 years in the playoffs he averaged 18.2 FG attempts per game and 24.9ppg. Then for the final 5 seasons of his playoff career he averaged 11.4 fg attmepts per game and 15.8 ppg. His playoff number are skewed because the majority of the games were played during his ""facilitator years"". He played  52 playoff games during his ""scoring machine era' where attempted a high number of Fgs per game, and he played 141 GAMES where during his ""facilitator era"" later in his career where he shot a SUBSTANIALLY less number of FGs per game.  
[Wilt Chamerlain Passing abilities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWHKZlQ9x7Q)    
Besides scoring he  posts pretty much the same number in rebounds and other major statistics.    
    
**Misconception #3**    
""Bill Russell shut Wilt down and was better than Wilt as evidenced by his 11 championship rings""    
First of all PLAYERS DO NOT WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS, TEAMS DO. Lebron beasted in cleveland but couldn't win until he went to miami. Kevin garnett beasted in Mn but did not win until he to the celtics. Jordan beasted in the 80s but didn't succeed until pippen developed into a top 10 player. Russell had a vastly superior team throughout his career. According to win share Russells teamates were worth 11 more wins per season :[Russell teamates](http://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/?p=4229). Russell had the benefit of playing for Red auerbach who is a top 3 greatest coach of all time while Wilt had a revolving door of coaches in his career. Russell also had the benefit of only being responsible for playing defense, While Wilt's teams relied on him for OFFENSE and DEFENSE.    
    
**Assorted Misconceptions**    
""Wilt wasn't respected among his peers who thought he was a poor teammate and competitor""

**1) Klay Thompson:** My 3rd choice in the regular season, but his post-season performances just stamped it all for me. Greatest shooter in the game today bar his partner in crime. Takes over games. 2-way beast.

**2) James Harden:** Hate him for his defense, but easily the best shot creator at his position today. Draws fouls easy. Deceptively crazy handles because of his size. Strong as a bull and has wide shoulders to create separation. Can playmake and is a triple-double threat when given the opportunity to run the point.

**3) Jimmy Butler:** Top of my list pre-injury. Didn't come back strong, but a great 2-way player. Is to slashing the way Klay is to shooting. Can run the point too. Egoistic. Better as a 2nd option if on a contender than a 1st.

**4) Dwyane Wade:** Still Top 5 today at 34 being the All-Time great he is. Further proving his solid fundamentals that he relies on more as he ages. Mid-range. 2-way. Clutch as always.

**5) DeMar DeRozan:** Was a toss up between Wade and him in the reg season, but I'm settling for him at 5 because of the contrast in clutch v choke. Elite slasher and mid-range, but a hole on defense. Athleticism on point.

**6) CJ McCollum:** Really came into his own last season. Craziest part about his rise is how unfazed he is and always seems so calm and collected as if he's already a star for years. Stable stroke and reliable in crunch time. Is some sort of a combo guard like how Brandon Roy was for the same team.

**7) J.J. Redick:** Klay-lite or elder-Klay. Is essentially Klay Thompson limited to just running off screens for catch and shoot 3s. Solid defensively. Is the ultimate complimentary piece to the 'Big 3' in LA. Does his role almost to perfection. Very smart at finding angles for separation and a sweet stroke to boot. Crazy efficient at 16 PPG on 48% 3PT FG.

**8) Khris Middleton:** Possibly the most underrated on this list. Low-key the most consistently good player on the underwhelming Bucks (won't say he's the best because of Giannis' out-of-nowhere explosion by season end). 3&D wing. Gives you 20 points if you need him to. Has the size advantage at 6 foot 8.

**9) J.R. Smith:** Big-time in the Finals. Known to be a rapid-fire 3-point chucker, but when tamed in an environment with stars around him, came into his own as a 'pick your poison' weapon. Sweet shooting stroke allows him to get a solid shot off off-balanced when his team needs it. Turns up his defense when called upon. Willing sacrifice of his ego en route to a long-awaited ring.

**10) Avery Bradley:** All-Defense level defense. Hounds the on-ball player like no other. Improved his 3-point shooting to become a respectable 3&D threat. Absence in the playoffs obviously cost Boston a well-matched series. Still, an undersized player at SG.

**Honorable mentions:**

**Brandon Knight & Victor Oladipo:** One played at an All-Star level pre-early-injury and the other may finally break out in the OKC-Harden role on a contender.

678,Why is it a prevalent opinion that Fultz will rediscover his jump shot in the off-season when he's worked on his jumper behind closed doors for 5 months and has shown marginal improvement at best?,0,8e67xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8e67xl/why_is_it_a_prevalent_opinion_that_fultz_will/,142,1524460020,"Here's Sixers' beat writer Kyle Neubeck answering a question on whether Fultz will improve his jump shot over the offseason: 

>I’m really not trying to be alarmist about Fultz’s future, but I don’t think the complete absence of his jumpshot is lending the most hope toward the reclamation of his shot.

>As I reported in February, the public timeline and the private timeline for what Fultz was doing this season are wildly different. This is not a player who was shut down and not working for an extended period of time — Fultz was in the gym working and shooting all throughout the season, including during the tumultuous months of October and November.

> Knowing that’s the case, the case for him rediscovering his jumper in the offseason becomes flimsier. It’s one thing to minimize expectations for skill development within a season because it’s hard to ask players to keep piling on new moves and traits when you’re trying to build a base of consistency. But Fultz is not having a normal season, and was allowed to essentially go through a skill development program without any of the day-to-day demands of playing in games.

> Is that much different from what he's going to be exposed to this offseason? I'm not sure. You can make a case that coaches and trainers he might work with would have unlimited time together in the offseason, free from the burden of helping with game prep and development of other players. They can get back to basics with Fultz without limitations. He's a hard worker and a good kid, and those facts still bode well.

> Theoretically, yes, a full offseason will help him more than anything he was able to do during the season. There's a low likelihood he'll play in Summer League, as I'd imagine the team will be happy to have him working out behind closed doors and just getting thousands of reps in as a jump-shooter.

> But as with anything Fultz-related, there's too much guesswork to say for sure. I don't know if or when the ""old form"" is coming back, and I would be skeptical about anyone who postures as such.

Had CP3 been on better teams in his career, he could be seen as the best or 2nd best PG of all time.

In the regular season, dude is 5th in BPM all-time (behind LeBron, MJ, Charles Barkley, and David Robinson) and 11th in VORP (just behind Larry Bird). 

For Win Shares, he's sporting a casual .247 career ws/48, which is 4th all-time behind MJ, David Robinson, and Wilt. LeBron is 6th. He comes in at 19th all-time in Win Shares, just behind Kobe Bryant.

RPM is seen as the best statistic for evaluating players, but only goes back to the 13-14 season. His ranks in the stat since its inception are as follows (starting with 2013, his age 28 season): 2nd, 7th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 12th. Only LeBron has done better. This isn't even counting CP3's prime years.

For counting stats, he is 7th in assists (2nd in AST% behind Stockton), 10th in steals (11th in STL%)

One more thing I would like to point you towards is him being #1 IN OFFENSIVE RATING ALL-TIME to go along with his 7x All-Defense First Team and 2x Second Team.

I haven't watched all of these guys and a lot of these judgments are based on stats alone, so please tell me if I got something wrong.

I put some guys here where it may be too early to call them a bust, so they could very well redeem their careers in the future. Conversely, it may be possible for some guys to make themselves seem more like busts over time.

#2018 NBA draft (1)

* No. 13: Jerome Robinson (barely played this year, stats not so good)

Draft is looking pretty stacked so far. Too early for anyone besides JRob to stick out as a potential bust, but of course, he can turn it around, it's only his first year.

#2017 NBA draft (2)

* No. 1: Markelle Fultz
* No. 8: Frank Ntilikina

Good lottery, things could change but so far only these two PGs stick out as busts. Fultz isn't bad, but relative to what you expect for a No. 1 pick, he kinda is. Frank is just bad, but he's young and can turn it around.

#2016 NBA draft (4)

* No. 4: Dragan Bender
* No. 8: Marquese Chriss (could turn it around, putting up good numbers after trade to Cavs)
* No. 10: Thon Maker
* No. 13: Georgios Papagiannis (not even in the league anymore...)

Weak draft, some solid players later in there but lottery isn't so hot. 

#2015 NBA draft (4)

* No. 5: Mario Hezonja
* No. 8: Stanley Johnson
* No. 9: Frank Kaminsky (if you're reading this, sorry)
* No. 14: Cameron Payne

Several solid rotation players in this draft. Jahlil Okafor would be here if I made the list a few months ago, but he's redeemed himself after his burst of really good play for New Orleans. If it's not sustainable, back here he'll go.

#2014 NBA draft (5)

* No. 1: Andrew Wiggins (wouldn't be considered a bust 2 years ago, but now, yeah)
* No. 2: Jabari Parker (injuries...)
* No. 5: Dante Exum
* No. 8: Nik Stauskas
* No. 9: Noah Vonleh

Stacked draft in terms of busts. Wiggins was looking good until he got his max contract. He promised to improve, but I don't think he can capitalize on that. Jabari ""They Don't Pay Me to Play Defense"" Parker is also looking more and more like a bust. Some solid players later in the draft.

#2013 NBA draft (5)

* No. 1: Anthony Bennett
* No. 4: Cody Zeller
* No. 5: Alex Len
* No. 7: Ben McLemore
* No. 14: Shabazz Muhammad

Pretty bad draft, with several high busts. Best player in the draft wasn't even a lottery selection.

#2012 NBA draft (3)

* No. 2: Michael Kidd-Gilchrist
* No. 5: Thomas Robinson
* No. 13: Kendall Marshall

Decent draft. Not too many busts, and some stars.

#2011 NBA draft (4)

* No. 2: Derrick Williams
* No. 6: Jan Vesely
* No. 7: Bismack Biyombo
* No. 10: Jimmer Fredette

Deep draft, but weak at the top (except for Kyrie).

#2010 NBA draft (5)

* No. 2: Evan Turner
* No. 4: Wesley Johnson
* No. 6: Epke Udoh
* No. 11: Cole Aldrich
* No. 12: Xavier Henry

Pretty mediocre draft. Most of the talent is at the top, and the top still has a good amount of busts mixed in.

#2009 NBA draft (6)

* No. 2: Hasheem Thabeet
* No. 6: Jonny Flynn
* No. 8: Jordan Hill
* No. 11: Terrence Williams
* No. 13: Tyler Hansbrough
* No. 14: Earl Clark

Stacked both in terms of superstar talent (Blake, Harden, Curry, DeMar) but lots of busts. Some solid players later in the draft.

#Conclusion

Interesting to note that Charlotte drafted (or traded for, on draft night) 5 busts in a row (2011-2015).

681,Why dont people ever mention how much easier it was for Jordan to score because of old defensive rules?,0,6co7h1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6co7h1/why_dont_people_ever_mention_how_much_easier_it/,38,1495498477,"If you want to compare Lebron and Jordan then compare the rules too.

There are two illegal defense rules. The old one prohibited zone defense. The new one limits the ability of a zone defender to remain in the paint guarding no one.

For decades the NBA required teams to play man-to-man defense, which meant everyone on the court had to guard someone. You could double team one player and then recover to your man, but you could not be caught between players, guarding no one. That would be an illegal defense. That also meant you couldn't just stand in the paint all day guarding no one.

To take advantage of this rule, lousy teams with one great player like Michael Jordan would put MJ on one side of the floor and everyone else on the other side. This was the isolation play, or iso, for short. It would turn into a game of one-on-one which MJ would win. (This is before Jordan found some worthy teammates and Phil Jackson incorporated them into the offense with the triangle.)

Various tweaks to the rules tried to limit isos, but never eliminated them. When zone defenses became legal, though, it made isos much harder. The two man game, the pick and roll or pick and pop, has become much more popular than isos, simply because the defense can easily flood the side of the floor where the iso is taking place, forcing the star player to go one on three or pass the ball.

The NBA tried to give something to iso players when it eliminate the old illegal defense rule and made the zone legal. In order to prevent rim protectors from standing in the paint all day, when the NBA eliminated one kind of illegal defense they created another, the 3 second rule. A defender cannot stand in the paint guarding no one for 3 seconds or longer. Every 2.9 seconds he has to step out of the paint. That's the modern illegal defense rule.

However, despite the new illegal defense rule, legalizing the zone defense led to Tim Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, popularized when Thibodeau was the assistant coach in charge of defense during the Celtics' championship season in 2007-08. The zone had been legal for a while, but Thibodeau figured out how to flood the strong side of the floor, the side with the ball, with an extra defender, often forcing a long cross-court pass that would allow time for the defense to recover. The object of the defense was to force the ball out of the best player's hands.

Thibodeau dealt with the new illegal defense rule by training Kevin Garnett (and later Joakim Noah) to remain in the paint for 2.9 seconds, step out, then step back in. As long as he steps out every 2.9 seconds, he could be in the paint all day, guarding no one.

Thibodeau's ICE strong-side overload defense, or variations thereof, have been widely adopted in the NBA. The iso has fallen out of favor. The two man game is very popular, but passing to the other side of the floor must remain an option if the two men on the strong side find themselves outnumbered. One of LeBron James' remarkable abilities, for example, is making bullet passes all the way across the floor with precision to a spot up shooter standing at the three point line, so that the defense doesn't have time to recover. This is a vital skill under present rules. 

In addition to this you couldnt double a player without the ball. It was much easier for Jordan to score with 90s rules than it would be with current ones.",0.49,controversial,5/22/17 17:14
682,[OC] Are Chris Paul and Big Sean the same person?,7,8q2b8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8q2b8t/oc_are_chris_paul_and_big_sean_the_same_person/,25,1528680334,"Hello /r/nba, I posted this before but now offseason is in full swing and this comparison still hasn't been compromised by the WCF. I have come to the startling realization that the NBA's very own Point God may possibly be the rapper Big Sean. In this post, I will prove to you that Big Sean and Chris Paul are the same people through three different categories: Physical Traits, Timeline and Legacy.

**Physical Traits**

Take a look: [Big Sean with a hat](https://i.imgur.com/tIHBExe.jpg) looks a lot like [Chris Paul with a hat](https://i.imgur.com/CUtcAPO.jpg). Similar facial hair, similar eyebrows, similar mouth, and both wearing hats. 

Furthermore, Chris Paul is an undersized point guard (""6'0"") with great court vision, smooth handles, and an underrated finishing ability. Big Sean, similarly, is an undersized rapper (5'8'') with a [great vision](https://youtu.be/D-OJud1suYA?t=1m27s), [smooth handles](https://i.imgur.com/rJ9oL41.jpg), and an [underrated finishing ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUVS0qhow7g). Those are not the most intriguing coincidental physical traits. 

Big Sean got his moniker because he has a self-proclaimed large dick (Google for a maybe photoshopped image). Chris Paul, likewise, [is a huge dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfKEBENB7tk).

If these physical similarities are not enough, consider this: both Big Sean and Chris Paul have never been seen together. Ever. Even though both lived in the same part of Los Angeles.

**Timeline**

If we take a look at both CP3 and Big Sean's timeline, we can see more similarities. First, let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, Chris Paul (33) is 3 years older than Big Sean (30), but you have to account for inflation and basketball age. Chris Paul is 6'0 officially. However, he is closer to 5'10 without basketball shoes, almost 3 inches less than his listed height. If he were to take off his basketball shoes, his age would scale accordingly and take 3 years off.

The most compelling evidence in their timelines is the release of the song [Bounce Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phr1pOFK1V8). In this song, Big Sean proclaims ""Last night I took an L but tonight I bounce back."" Released mid-2017, ever since the song gained traction that summer, Chris Paul has [never lost back-to-back games in Houston](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/p/paulch01/gamelog/2018/) when he played EXCEPT one time. The only time he lost 2 games in a row was in Detroit, or Big Sean's hometown. Every other game he played, he bounced back after taking the L.

Big Sean's album releases also coincide with events in Chris Paul's life. His first studio album, ""Finally Famous"", was released in 2011. This year was also when Chris Paul signed to the Clippers, where he moved to LA where people become famous. 

Big Sean's second album, ""Hall of Fame"", was released in 2013, around the time when people realized that CP3 had a likely chance to go in the Hall of Fame as one of the best point guards. This was around the time that CP3 got his first MVP award (All-Star Game) and led the Clippers to a franchise-high 56 wins at the time. Through this album, Sean released his hit single [Guap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ6y5nIW26E). Similarly, Paul signed a 5 year $107 million contract with the Clippers.

""Dark Sky Paradise"", Sean's third album released in 2013, parallel's Paul's discontention with the Clippers. With song names like All Your Fault, I Don't Fuck With You, Play No Games, Win Some, Lose Some, and Stay Down, Sean chronicles Chris Paul's failures to go past the second round in the NBA Playoffs.

CP3, after years of mediocrity in the playoffs, got fed up and signed with Houston to create a contending team. Fittingly, Big Sean released his album ""I Decided."" in 2017 around the time of the signing, clearly parallelling LeBron's The Decision but for Chris Paul. This album has the hit song [Moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cIkC7s3d2o), of which Chris Paul has [many](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ler0hq_lYfM).

**Legacy**

Both Chris Paul and Big Sean are stars in the NBA and hip-hop communities, respectively. Chris Paul is widely regarded as one of the best point guards in the league currently, but has never been the consensus best. Big Sean is one of the top selling rappers in the game, but will never reach the level of Kanye, Kendrick, Jay-Z etc. Both men have name recognition but not a lot of facial recognition to casual consumers.

I deem both Chris Paul and Big Sean with the Modelo Legacy.

What is the Modelo Legacy, you ask?

Well, Modelo, as some know, is a beer. It's a decent beer. Most Americans have heard of it and many people have had it before. If someone asks you, ""All I got is a Modelo, you want it?"", most people would say sure. It is entirely socially acceptable to enjoy a nice Modelo, but if someone says that it is their favorite beer, something is wrong. No one should have Modelo as their favorite beer. They can enjoy one, but at the end of the day, Corona is a better AB InBev beer that tastes better.

Similarly, Big Sean is a good rapper. He makes hits. People play him at parties and enjoy his songs, singing along to his catchy hits. People understand him as a popular rapper and no one bats an eye if you say you like Big Sean. But once someone says that Big Sean is their FAVORITE rapper, you know something's wrong. There are many answers to the question, ""who is your favorite rapper,"" but Big Sean is not one. You can list any rapper (Biggie, Danny Brown, Elzhi, Ghostface, Future, Chance, Kendrick, Uzi Vert, Famous Dex, Yung Lean) and you can usually argue why you like them the best. There are no arguments why Big Sean is someone's favorite rapper. Hell, even the hometown treatment doesn't work because Eminem and Slaughterhouse is from Detroit.

In CP3's case, he is a great player. People call him the Point God because he is very good at what he does. He plays defense, he passes the ball, and he scores. Fans like Chris Paul. It's fine to do so. It's respectable. But at this moment, he shouldn't be anyone's favorite player. He's not the best point guard in the league anymore (or at any time shoutout to Deron Williams fans). He isn't even the best guard on his own team. Houston fans usually like Harden or Capela more. Pelicans fans like AD, Boogie, or Jrue. Clippers fans now like DJ, Lou, or Boban.

However, both Sean and Paul will have a legacy in the hip-hop and NBA communities. Big Sean is one of the best selling artists of the current generation and has headlined many festivals. He has had multiple albums reach number 1 in the Billboard charts and has multiple triple platinum songs. Chris Paul will still be remembered as one of the greatest point guards ever in the NBA. He is a 9-time All-Star, 7-time All-NBA, and 9-time All-Defense player destined to enter the Hall of Fame.

**Conclusion**

So what do you think? Are Chris Paul and Big Sean the same person?

TL;DR: Paul and Sean big same.",0.52,controversial,6/10/18 18:25
683,[OC] Joel Embiid is (not) a Turnover Machine,0,858nz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/858nz3/oc_joel_embiid_is_not_a_turnover_machine/,34,1521369829,"I've seen a bunch of posts on this subreddit talking about Embiid and one of the biggest criticisms of his game: turnovers. The general narrative seems to be that Embiid is a young player who turns the ball over a lot, and is therefore one of the driving forces behind the 76ers leading the league in turnovers.  

I'd like to argue the opposite. **I believe Embiid helps the 76ers prevent turnovers more than any other player on the team** and I'll try to show why.  

First, let's take a look at the best and worst teams in the league with turnovers (full data [here](https://stats.nba.com/teams/traditional/?sort=TOV&dir=-1)):

|Rank|Team|Turnovers Per Game|
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|1|Mavericks|12.4
|2|Timberwolves|12.4
|...|...|...
|28|Warriors|15.7
|29|Lakers|15.9
|30|76ers|17.0
The 76ers are the worst team in the league at taking care of the ball. There are a number of reasons why this might be, ranging from inexperience to starting a rookie point guard with shooting struggles, but I'd argue the single biggest reason is their *style of play*. They play an offensive system with a fast pace, lots of ball movement, and lots of player movement. [This recent Nylon Calculus piece by Ian Levy](https://fansided.com/2018/03/07/nylon-calculus-offensive-style-changes-2017-18-season/) does a great job visualizing these offensive styles in a clear way, and when we look at teams like the [Mavericks](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Mavs.jpg) and [Timberwolves](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Timberwolves.jpg) (who rarely turn it over) versus the [Warriors](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/Warriors.jpg) and [76ers](https://fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2018/03/76ers.jpg) (who turn it over a ton), it's easy to see the difference. I'm not going to argue that one style of offense is inherently better than another, but I think it's reasonable to say the Warriors/76ers style causes more turnovers at a team level than a slow offense with fewer moving parts.

---
Now let's imagine dropping a player into this high-turnover system. How would you measure whether they were turnover prone themselves as opposed to being a victim of the system?  
I'd propose looking at how much the 76ers turn it over when that player is on the floor versus when they are off. To do this, we'll use team turnover percent (TOV%) instead of turnovers per game, and among those with at least 100 minutes played this season, here is the data (full data [here](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612755/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1)):  

|Player|Minutes Played|76ers TOV% On Court (Rank)|76ers TOV% Off Court (Rank)
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|Ilyasova|198|14.3% (1/14)|14.1% (1/14)
|Embiid|1782|15.7% (2/14)|17.9% (14/14)
|Luwawu-Cabarrot|807|16.2% (3/14)|16.9% (12/14)
|Anderson|387|16.3% (4/14)|16.8% (9/14)
|Belinelli|362|16.3% (5/14)|15.3% (2/14)
|Redick|1776|16.5% (6/14)|17.0% (13/14)
|Covington|2119|16.5% (7/14)|16.9% (11/14)
|Saric|2046|16.6% (8/14)|16.8% (10/14)
|Booker|494|16.7% (9/14)|16.5% (6/14)
|Simmons|2316|16.8% (10/14)|16.5% (7/14)
|Holmes|522|17.3% (11/14)|16.6% (8/14)
|McConnell|1491|17.4% (12/14)|16.2% (4/14)
|Bayless|925|17.4% (13/14)|16.4% (5/14)
|Johnson|927|18.5% (14/14)|16.0% (3/14)
|Overall|3284|16.7%|16.7%
Embiid's numbers stand out. Other than Ilyasova, who recently joined the team during a time when turnovers have been down overall, the team turns it over the least when Embiid is on the floor and the most when he is off. This is not at all what we would expect if Embiid was the reason behind the turnovers. It actually looks much more like a stabilizing player inserted into a turnover-prone system.  
There is an alternative hypothesis why Embiid's on/off are so staggering. Maybe his backup is the real issue, dragging everyone else's TOV% up except for Embiid's. This is (rightly) a common critique of on/off data, and while this might seem plausible looking at Amir Johnson's numbers, it seems doubtful. Johnson is actually having a [career low](https://stats.nba.com/player/101161/?sort=PCT_TOV&dir=-1) in the % of his team's turnovers attributed to him, and his on/off data using team TOV% [with](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) [Boston](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612738/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2015-16&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) and [with](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2014-15&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) [Toronto](https://stats.nba.com/team/1610612761/onoffcourt-advanced/?sort=TM_TOV_PCT&dir=-1&Season=2013-14&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) placed him either among his team's best or middle of the pack. Johnson simply looks bad because he never gets to benefit from sharing the floor with Embiid, unlike Richaun Holmes, the other backup center who often sees minutes at power forward alongside Joel.

---
**TL;DR**: Of course Embiid makes bad decisions with the ball, forces passes at times, and could do a better job handling double teams. Anyone who watches the 76ers can see it, and it can even drive his fans nuts. But for those who argue that he's the reason why the 76ers lead the league in turnovers, I'd say he's the only reason they're not even worse.",0.5,controversial,3/18/18 3:43
684,My case for Lebron James deserving his 5th MVP,2,5uo17e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5uo17e/my_case_for_lebron_james_deserving_his_5th_mvp/,65,1487387712,"First of all, I'm a Lebron die hard fan. He is why I started watching basketball back in 2006 and he's why I'm ferociously obsessed with it today. So, if my bias is sticking way out, I apologize. But here's my case for Lebron deserving the MVP this season. 

As of today,
Harden on-court: +7.6
Harden off: +4.6
Westbrook on-court:+3.2
Westbrook off: -10.5
Lebron on-court: +9.1
Lebron off: -4.2
So, what does that mean? It means that Hardens team does well without him and I attribute that to the crazy tempo and system the Rockets play in. Westbrooks total net rating here is +13.7 where Lebrons is +13.3, so Westbrook is having a greater positive impact on his team overall by 2/5 of a point over Lebron. A marginal difference which I'm going to call a tie. 
Lebron/Westbrook: 1
Harden: 0

Harden and Westbrook have had healthy teams all year. I know they both have rosters with less talent than Cleveland, but that can't be ignored. Lebrons been down a starting guard for months and will continue to be, as well as being down another starting all star forward for the rest of the regular season almost. Hes doing more with less in my opinion because of the uncertainty from game to game. This whole section is my bias sticking way out but hey, whatever. 
Lebron:2
Brodie:1
Beard:0

Hardens team is a top 4 seed in the west, but they've been struggling recently. Brodies team is the 7 seed I believe, but they're just not a very good team in general. Lebrons team is the 1 seed in the east and are 7-1 in their last 8. 1 seed > 4-7 seeds. Therefore,
Lebron:3
Brodie:1
Beard:0

All 3 guys are averaging career highs in assists, so that's a wash. Harden is leading the league in assists though, so he gets the point here. 
Brodie is averaging a triple double. holy fuck. he gets a point too. Lebrons shooting 39% from 3 this year, his second highest ever, and a higher number than KD can claim. For Lebron, that's a storyline in itself. No point for that, but it's noteworthy considering that was a worry going into the playoffs last year. 
Lebron:3
Brodie:2
Beard:1

Now it's about the narrative. Brodie has the KD departure/revenge tour on his side along with the triple doubles. But, he's a turnover machine (not entirely his fault, but still) and he's super inefficient offensively and average defensively. And, his team isn't going to finish top 4. How far will the narrative carry him? I don't know. 
Beard is on a fun and dope team to watch, they let 3s fly, and don't play defense at all. He's still a bad defensive player, but he has the astronomical numbers and change to point guard thing going for him. How far will his numbers go to persuade people? I don't know. 
Lebrons interesting. He has the ""here's your reward for what you did last June"" thing in his favor, he has an injury depleted team for the remainder of the season which will only spotlight his play even more, and he's having his best season ever if you exclude his 4 MVP years. He's the universally accepted best player in the world, leading his team to the 1 seed in his conference, averaging 26, 9, and 8 on 54% from the field and 39% from 3. I give this one to Lebron. 
Bron:4
Brodie:2
Beard:1 
Also, I didn't include Kawhi because he hasn't been getting the buzz at all so I just assumed it would be kinda impossible for him to jump all the way into the conversation and I didn't include KD or Steph because they cancel each other out, in my opinion. 

Anyway, there's my biased take on why Lebron deserves the MVP. If I missed anything narratively for these guys or if I'm forgetting an important stat or something, let me know. I'll update this thing if I need to.",0.51,controversial,2/17/17 19:15
685,[Serious] I think people overrate Anthony Davis too much.,37,crqz97,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/crqz97/serious_i_think_people_overrate_anthony_davis_too/,137,1566100106,"A whole lot of fans think he's a top 5 player in the league & that he has the potential to be the best & **that it's not his fault he hasn't had more success, but his team's fault** 

The thing is though compared to Giannis, Kawhi, Steph, LeBron, Jokic even, he doesn't make his team better. 

All of those guys create shots for themselves or create shots for their teammates. 

The man hasn't won a MVP, DPOY, not has been in actual consideration for those awards he's not even top 20 in both offensive & defensive per 48min win shares.

If you go for total win shares he's 13th behind Capela, Gobert, & Vuecic 

Hell the man quit on his team to take a easy way out, he doesn't even want to play the 5 because he doesn't want to get too injured, yet if you want to win you do whatever it takes.

Imo he's overrated, Giannis who came into the league a year later has the same amount of all nba selections, was in consideration for DPOY, & already won a MVP in less time than AD.

I don't buy the shitty roster statement that AD has been excused with, Jrue is a all-star caliber guy, Boogie before he went down is a top 10 center, Rondo while old played well for the Pelicans, yes Moore & Crawford weren't all that great but Giannis had to work with Joel Bolmboy, John Henson, DeAndre Liggins. 

Yes he had Parker & Brogdon but AD did have Holiday & Cousins, it's not like **the Pelicans didn't try to give him talent** hell **Alvin Gentry is a DAMN better coach than both Jason Kidd & Joe Prunty**

Like if you keep on saying ""so & so's roster was garbage"" you might as well excuse Karl Anthony Towns if he underachieves this year & leaves, or Devin Booker, guys who have so much talent, are considered top talents but everyone is saying they'll leave sooner than later because their organizations apparently missed the mark. Fact is that the teams can only do so much, the Wolves got **Jimmy Butler** which is a good move that didn't work out LIKE the Boogie trade. 

The Sun's just got Ayton who is a **BEAST** & now have a possible good PG in Jalen Lecque while getting Rubio in the meantime to help his development/start for them.

**TL;DR:**  Truly top 5 players elevate their teams & you can only blame a roster for so long, especially when there's evidence that the organization has tried to bring in talent to help their star + lack of consideration of alocades, it comes down to that specific player not having that talent to elevate their teams like Kawhi, LeBron, KD, Harden, Curry, Giannis & even Jokic. That's why I think AD is not as good as people make him sound like.**",0.56,controversial,8/17/19 20:48
686,Addressing homophobia in and around the NBA,0,auswuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/auswuo/addressing_homophobia_in_and_around_the_nba/,145,1551171543,"Firstly I’d like to state I’m not making a controversial post for attention nor mean to make wild accusations of homophobia, as there are much more relevant examples in the world. I am making this post because I care as much about LGBT issues as the NBA. 

Also, don’t take this as an attack on why you enjoy the NBA or that enjoying certain characteristics of players makes you a bad person. I am simply using LGBT activism as a lens to be critical of the culture surrounding the NBA. 

My post uses incidents of homophobia in and around the NBA and the response to make an argument rather than data. I would also like to admit my argument here isn’t irrefutable and there are likely holes in my reasoning. 

With that said, let’s talk about Dwight. 

Now, immediately I want to separate jokes made about the allegations and actual homophobia. I’m talking about people calling Dwight a f*g or that he’s traded frequently because he’s a predator in the locker room. I know what you’re thinking: “That’s just how some toxic fans think and not representative of everyone” and I agree, to an extent. In the late 1960s the Celtics asked the city what could improve attendance. A lot (don’t know the exact percent, citation needed) of responses were “get rid of the black players”. Although those Celtics fans were only some of the fans of the NBA I think it accurately shows how a fanbase can be problematic without it necessarily being the majority.

With that said here’s my question: Why is there a homophobic culture in the NBA when social
activism is a big aspect of the league. 

Well, my response requires a suspension of disbelief in the sense that I don’t have concrete metrics on how to measure bigotry and what causes it. In order to answer the question, I need to define who is a fan of the NBA. 

Well, fans of basketball, who presumably played / are playing organized basketball.
 (I know this is obvious but it’s going somewhere). Since these fans wanted / want to be like their idols, there must be qualities of NBA players that they emulate. I propose the most revered aspect of an NBA player is their background, more specifically if they went from “Rags to Riches”. People like this quality because they think it’ll make them a better player because of the characteristics we attach to these players. That they work harder than the rest, that they deserve respect for making it out of their challenging situation, etc. However, I believe that another aspect of these players that fans idolize is their masculinity, as “a man does what it take to succeed in life”. 

Hopefully it’s clear where I’m going with this now. That the reason NBA fans are generally contradictory in their beliefs about social activism is because being gay isn’t seen as a masculine. 

(I don’t believe this is true but hopefully my argument makes sense now). 

NBA fans respect players because their masculinity allows them to work harder than the rest and become one of the best basketball players in the world. Therefore, (some) NBA fans don’t respect non masculine players / players they don’t think are masculine. For example, Dwight Howard being seen as gay, and in turn disrespected. 

I think this mentality isn’t exclusive to fans but also players.

 For instance, Jokic’s “No Homo” comment which, although it wasn’t homophobic, demonstrates a disdain for what’s perceived as non masculine. If that example doesn’t convince you, maybe Tim Hardaway Sr. stating he hates gay people in regards to former NBA player John Amaechi coming out as gay. 

Summary: 
Now, I’m not saying it’s impossible to go from rags to riches and not hate gays. I’m also not saying all NBA players go from rags to riches or that all NBA players believe masculinity causes greatness. I’m simply making an argument on why homophobia exists in the NBA (and I guess also in other sports) when it seems hypocritical.

Tl;dr - players and fans think masculinity is vital to being a good player which leads them to have homophobic ideas",0.48,controversial,2/26/19 0:59

Can we be serious here for a minute? Philadelphia is nowhere near a championship caliber team. This team is closer to being the Bruno Caboclo of the league than a championship contender at this rate. Their top 3 players are: a 1st overall that hasn't even been drafted yet, a 1st pick that missed his entire rookie season due to injury, and then the only player that has actually made all-star level contributions on the court can't even play 82 games over the span of 3 seasons...

The rest of your roster are either mediocre players that would get relegated to bench-warmer on any playoff team and a bunch of d-league level guys.  

Plus you have an average FO that is paired with a medical team that is the biggest shit-storm I have seen in recent memory. These guys cleared a player (Embiid) and said he didn't have injuries, then he got injured, then they say he was actually injured the whole time.

Championship level teams make the finals.
Have the sixers done that recently? No.
Have they made the ECF yet? No.
Have they made it out of the first round? No.
Have they even made the playoffs in a weak eastern conference? No.

This team has yet to even leave the lottery and people are hyping the shit out of this roster like I have never seen before, it's absurd.

They ""like"" him but the **respect** isn't there. 

Quick tangent: my aunt is the black sheep of the family. She married a douche at 18, dropped out of college, accrued a lot of debt and generally made a lot of dumb mistakes. In her 40s-50s she turned things around (graduated, got a good job, etc.); but she's still the designated cautionary tale of our clan. Everyone will say ""it's great she accomplished X, Y & Z, but just think of how much better off she'd be if she'd done it 20yrs ago"" or ""if she'd been smarter with money"" etc. etc. 

KD reminds me of this women, doomed to forever be perceived/portrayed as a weak willed screw-up, and used as a cautionary tale for young players. 

**Just consider:**

* KD goes to the Warriors he's called weak. 
* He wins two chips they say he's riding coattails. 
* He's injured and can't play, they say the dubs swept the Blazers, proving they didn't need him. 
* The dubs start to lose, they say he's checked out on his teammates cause he plans to leave anyway.
* Dubs go down 3-1, they say he's weak and hiding cause he doesn't want to risk returning and losing 
* He returns, plays well and suffers the worst injury an NBA player can suffer, they say he's great for trying to play...***but it was just another sign that he is susceptible to peer pressure/public influence.***

 He has often been compared to Lebron or Curry and found lacking (in maturity, as a leader, as a man). The latest narrative is how the strong and stoic Kawhi (who doesn't give a fuck what anyone thinks) wisely chose not to play. Whereas KD was worried about public opinion, media coverage and peer perception, so he fucked himself over by choosing to play too early. This narrative has been dispersed by friends and media alike.

Yes, Kawhi had his turn being dragged last year...but he is being lauded now *because he won*. Winning solved ***nothing*** for KD as far as the media was concerned.

After he won back to back chips, the praise was qualified with talk of asterisks or ""look at his team"" or ""he needs to leave if he wants to prove himself.""

689,Amin Elhassan is exaggerating how good the Golden St. Warriors' defensive was this season (particularly as compared to the Atlanta Hawks).,0,4j3ydu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4j3ydu/amin_elhassan_is_exaggerating_how_good_the_golden/,67,1463130806,"It baffles me that many within the basketball world -- most recently Amin Elhassan on The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz today (05/12/2016: http://espn.go.com/espnradio/show?showId=danlebatard) -- continue to discount what the Cavs have done so far in the 2016 Playoffs. Near the end of the podcast, Amin went off about how much better Golden St.'s defensive is compared to either team the Cavs have faced so far in the Eastern Conference Playoffs (Detroit or Atlanta). He pointed out that points allowed per game isn't a good measure of how good/bad a team's defense is (TRUE) and that things like points allowed per 100 possessions is a better/more accurate measure of a team's defensive prowess (also TRUE). Using that (sound) logic, however, he went on to imply that the Warriors defense this season has been significantly better than anything the Cavs have seen thus far in the Playoffs. But is that true?

* Defensive Rating (DRtg) for teams is points allowed per 100 possessions. The Warriors allowed 103.8 points per 100 possessions, good for #6 in the NBA; the Hawks, by comparison, allowed 101.4 points per 100 possessions, good for #2 in the NBA (second only to the Spurs historic defense).
* Another helpful team defensive metric is opponents Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%), which adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal. Golden St.'s eFG% allowed was 47.9%, good for #2; the Hawks' eFG% allowed was 48%, tied for #3.
* Defensive Rebounding Percentage (DRB%) is also a helpful defensive metric because it estimates the percentage of available defensive rebounds a team grabs. The Warriors grabbed 76% of available defensive rebounds; the Hawks grabbed 74.6% of available defensive rebounds.
* A final metric is the ratio of free throw per field goal attempt (FT/FGA - the lower the better). Golden St. ranked #17 at .208; the Hawks ranked #4 at .198.

More specifically to the question of a possible Warriors vs. Cavs Finals, many have wondered whether or not the Cavs can keep up their historic 3pnt shooting (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cavs-3-point-barrage-in-game-2-was-ridiculous/ | http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2016/05/11/analytics-art-cavaliers-sizzle-from-3-point-range-in-2016-playoffs/ | http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_active_p.html | https://hoopshabit.com/2016/05/08/cleveland-cavaliers-3-point-shooting-sustainable/). Consider:

* The Warriors ranked #2 by allowing opponents to shoot 33.2% from beyond the arc; the Hawks ranked #6 at 33.8%.
* Golden St. ranked #13 in 3's allowed (1,927 = 23.5 3's allowed per game or 26.3% of opponent FGA); Atlanta ranked #16 (2,008 = 24.4 3's allowed per game or 28.4% of FGA).
* Golden St. allowed opponents to shoot 35.8% on corner 3's (representing 18.3% of opponent 3PA); the Hawks allowed opponents to shoot 37.6% on corner 3's (representing 25.3% of opponent 3PA).
* 77.3% of 3PM versus Golden St. were assisted; 84.1% of 3PM versus Atlanta were assisted. 

None of this means that the Cavs will average ~19 3PM per game against the Warriors (or the Raptors, Heat, Thunder, or Spurs). None of this means that the Cavs will continue to shoot better from beyond the 3P line than inside of it. (It may suggest that the Cavs corner 3P and/or assisted 3PM will decline a bit.) What this DOES MEAN, however, is that Amin Elhassan's assertion that the Warriors defensive this season was substantially better than any defense the Cavs have seen in the Playoffs this season is demonstrably false. At best, the Hawks and Warriors were comparable defensive teams during the regular season; at worst, the Hawks may have been a bit better (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hawks-have-a-better-shot-at-stopping-the-cavs-this-time/).

So, while it is true that the Cavs are more likely to regress to their regular season shooting numbers (35% of their FGA were from 3P, where they shot 36.3% (on 2,427 3PA)) than continue their current blistering pace (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2016/05/09/cavs-offense-can-carry-them-to-finals-even-if-historic-three-point-shooting-cools/ | http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/15494567/nba-playoffs-2016-cleveland-cavaliers-continue-hitting-3-pointers | ), the regular season numbers suggest that it won't be because Golden St. is far superior than Atlanta at defending the 3.

You mentioned kind of the chess match. Is that the team you were talking about -- how Atlanta tried different ways to defend them?

So far, there hasn't been a chess match. They've been too good. It was one thing against us, but I watched that Atlanta series with great interest. Atlanta was the second-best defensive team in the league, and I'm thinking, ""This'll be great, to watch how they defend Cleveland."" And they didn't even have as good luck as we did.

They tried everything -- Kent Bazemore on LeBron, Paul Millsap on him, starting Thabo Sefolosha, all kinds of switching.

You have two guys like LeBron and Kyrie Irving who can take you off the dribble, [Love is] maybe the best inside-outside big guy in the league, and then everyone is shooting at that level -- I don't know what your options even are. I didn't have an answer. I'm anxious to watch the next two rounds and see if someone else does something that works better.

But they've played at an extremely high level, and if they are going to shoot the ball like this, they have as good a chance to win the championship as anybody, East or West.

Now, I don't know they can go four series shooting like that.

I don't see how it's possible.

When they did it against Atlanta's defense, I guess I really took notice. We were a slightly above-average defensive team, but when you look at what Atlanta was able to build defensively and saw what Cleveland did to them -- wow.",0.49,controversial,5/13/16 2:13

What was done to solve this? Lose their best floor spacer and their closer. Nothing done to add complementary prices to the bench. 

Tobías is better suited at the 4, but Hortford will now assume that role, though it is not his natural role. Josh Richardson is nowhere near the shooter JJ was. Josh also has a tendency to slash more than JJ and while his metrics show he was more effective spotting up, his volume in that area is a much smaller sample compared to JJ. 

The bench was not upgraded - depth was an issue last year as well, but at least they had four all-stars. 

The 76ers smallest player will be 6’6” (Josh) and 6’9” on average - a huge lineup. I know Al is very quick for his size, and so is Ben, but the direction the league is tending makes me doubt that the 76ers will be as elite on Defense as the media has implied. 

The team did not get better on the break. Josh will push with Ben, but the rest of their players are not big time floor runners, neither is anyone off of their bench. 

The slowed pace will likely be most effective against Indiana or Orlando, who already play slow - I do not think they can withstand the Bucks even with Al on Giannis. The Nets will push pace, the Celts will push, the Heat will push. 

All this assumes Ben and Joel stay healthy. There is an insurance policy for Joel in Al, and an okay filler for Ben in Josh. 

Ben needs to develop a shot. Embid needs to stay healthy and show up when it counts, even then I don’t see them as better than last year. 4th seed IMO and a second round exit.

But the Bucks Hornets PGT just summed up this subs hive mind for mine. Hornets are like what 15-31 with a mediocre coach and a mediocre roster. But last night we played the best game of our season by far. JB’s coaching was spot on for once, going small vs Giannis with surprising efficacy, and with PJ guarding Giannis super well on drives. Malik Monk dropped 31/5/5 with ELITE defence. Tae showed his craftiness and still hit some shots. 


Like rewatch that game man. Giannis literally grabbed offensive boards over those guys to bail out bricks from some of these Bucks guys to get them the win. Late game Malik was still getting clutch buckets vs Donte without any screen to create separation, just straight up ISOs because our coach played him offball basically most of the game(which again is so idiotic, he turns it over but his vision is insane. Look at this kinda pass: https://twitter.com/richierandall/status/1220831983762399233?s=21).


Now let’s look at the Hornets Bucks PGT top comments: 

- “Giannis in the 4th: aight well I guess we should win the game and shit” (527 upvotes at time of voting: verbal fellatio but completely fair because without him they don’t win this one. 
- “40-6 sounds so much more substantial than 39-6. Them bucks is good “ (262 upvotes at time of writing): again completely fair. Monumental achievement by a GREAT team
- “Yes folks Batum really is that bad.. 1/8 shooting for 5pts in 34 minutes in your only regular season game ever in your home country.” (109 upvotes “ “)again completely founded
- “Phil Jackson said if you reach 40 wins before 20 losses you are a contender. But these guys reached 40 wins before 10 losses. It's absolutely unreal” (289 upvotes “ “) ok sure another one about 40 wins, again fair.
- “40 wins before 20 losses. We a real contender” (172 upvotes “ “) ok again fair, reference to Phil’s quote. But surely those comments stop there...
- “i have the feeling the bucks kept the game close for us poor french but then decided to win late in the fourth” (51 upvotes) no talk about our strategic doubling, our small ball lineups, our strong halfcourt O spearheaded by our future backcourt Tae and Malik, or PJ’s strong ISO defence on Giannis and our aggressive help off bad shooters like Donte and Bledsoe. The worst so far, but excusable. 
- “40-6 and still need to win 9 more just to get on pace for 73-9.i sometimes forget how ridiculous that streak was.” (126 upvotes “ “) ok now it’s getting repetitive.
- “That was a pretty solid, competitive game until the Bucks woke up and completely took over during the final six minutes” (84 upvotes “ “)ok I’ll take this but I don’t think the Bucks “woke up” I think Giannis kept dominating the glass which saved this team from an embarrassing loss to a team that’s 15-31
- “Donte DiVincenzo is a future all star” (113 upvotes);  ok I’ll accept it because he’s super underrated by non Bucks fans but he did get cooked by Malik consistently in one on one situations...just saying. And his ballhandling and PnR skills aren’t quite all star level yet although he could reach there. He’s got great court vision, and he’ll be all defence one day. Very good player. 
- “The consistency in which the bucks play this year is amazing.....at home or on the road, good team bad team doesn't matter, imo that's the biggest reason why Giannis is MVP handily it's a direct reflection of his leadership and the way he plays on both sides of the ball” (34 upvotes): wouldn’t say this is a great win. Hornets showed that Bucks still struggle with Bledsoe spotting up and shooting, Hornets showed Bucks defence is prone to giving up wide open 3s since we had so many practice shots. Hornets showed going small not a death sentence vs Bucks and hence Boston and Stevens probably would be watching this tape and  using it for their own defenders. Maybe they use Ojeleye or Brown in the PJ on Giannis, objected with stating in front of Giannis, while elite help defenders like Tatum and Williams come over and help.
- “It was close for two and half quarters, I'll take it
- “Also MONKKKKKK. He better get more fucking consistent playing time now. The second best guard (arguably best tbh) on the roster behind Graham. This isn't meant to be Rozier slander btw, it's just he is not a good point guard at all, he's a good catch and shoot player” (57 upvotes): shoutout my fucking guy u/buzzbuzz01 for being a hornets fan and somehow getting more than 10 upvotes on a comment in this thread.
- “Robin Lopez is a thot. He's a freaking nasty hoe. His hair is so good. I'd love Robin to beat my ass like a mascot and tell me all about the benefits of looking homeless. If a 7 foot tall Sideshow Bob shows up with comic books and his twin brother he can fuck me up any fucking time of day dude. If a guy's like 'I come off the bench but I'll make you feel things you've never felt before' i'm like 'slam a basketball in my ass like its the Slam Dunk contest my dude'.” (67 upvotes): ok one of these is fine I guess. Unnecessary given he didn’t really do anything in game; he’s a cult hero but save it for when he does something.


Finally after trawling through all these comments, I find this nice one from a guy with a Greece flair u/de_grecia:


- “Good game by the Hornets. Gave it all. Wasn't enough though. The Bucks might indeed go all the way”
How many upvotes? A whopping 12.

Now, let’s go to the YouTube video for Bucks Hornets highlights here: https://youtu.be/vhcHamiNh1g

- “Man Charlotte came to play” ( 9 likes)
- “Fantastic play by the hornets but Giannis is unreal” (35 likes): completely true and simple summation of the game. Bucks are contenders for a reason but hornets played the best game they’ve played this season.
- “ what an effort by the hornets “ (11 likes)


Finally this one which I’ll link in a comment below because I don’t have an imgur account and where I’m from it’s 5.30 AM and I can’t sleep. 



Overall, I mean YouTube just has far more complementary, humble, and well researched comments than the r/nba PGT.

And now? They are an old, essentially talent deficient core aside from LeBron. This team was supposed to get **better** as Lebron aged due to the cores age.

Personally, I would prefer to have Paul run my team, but that is personal preference and as much as I love Curry, I have a weird feeling the NBA will suddenly see 6'3-6'5 versions of Chris Paul instead of more Steph Curry's, and that just sounds more exciting to me than a bunch of point guards who play like their MyPlayers.

**1) Passing**

+ Chris Paul may finish his career as a 19-10 guy, which would be historical and unprecedented. I don't think Curry will ever reach that, but he could see his assist numbers rise if he wanted. However, that assist:TO is absurd. Paul is giving his team between 8-12 points for every one time he costs them a possession. I'm about to make a stat up, but that's at least 8ppm (points per mistake). Curry's is still good for an NBA point guard, but Paul's is transcendent.
+ Sheer numbers wise, Chris Paul just runs an offense in a very traditional way. He is every coach's dream. Put it this way: if a 5'8-6'0 freshman walked into basketball tryouts in high school and played the way Paul does, he would get sent straight to varsity and possibly even see loads of court time. Nothing is better than a point guard who can pass, shoot, defend, and not turn the ball over. Curry would take time to win the coaches ever, much like he has taken time to win fans over, and that's not a knock on him; it's just the way the game goes. It's changing now, but at every level, Paul's passing and decision making when passing is a tier above the rest of the NBA, and it has been for the past six or seven years.
+ Curry makes much flashier passes than Chris Paul, wows the crowd more, and actually has the ability to make certain passes that Paul can't because teams attempt to deter Curry from the three point line with more reckless abandon than dog owners deter their dogs from chocolate cake. However, Curry's flair for that signature behind the back pass leads to a few turnovers and embarrassing out of bounds bounces. Paul makes the right pass and gets flashy with lobs and threading the needle. It's subtle, not as flashy, but more effective in game and in getting Paul assists. This is personal preference, but I'd rather have a guy hit my players in their shooting pockets 9/10 times than a flashy behind the back pass that they have to adjust for. But until Curry starts hitting his players in rhythm with those flashy passes among other passing nuances...
+ Advantage: **Chris Paul**

________

**2) Shooting**

+ The absolute number one thing that stands out: Curry is a much better shooter. Given that we widely regard Chris Paul as an elite shooter, to have Curry extend even beyond that is mindboggling. Chris Paul is a better career midrange shooter: career ~47% between 3 and 16 feet. Compared to Curry: ~42.5% between 3 and 16 feet. However, Curry is getting better and better, with his average this year around 47% as well. 
+ eFG% measures the efficiency of shooting, and Curry blows Paul away in that regard. 
+ Steph Curry's off the dribble shooting, quick release, and uncanny ability to score threes off 7+ dribbles almost as efficiently as the rest of the league does *uncontested* (don't know where I saw this stat, Nylon Calculus I believe) makes him the greatest shooter of all time on pure skill and versatility. He also does have the two best seasons ever when it comes to made threes. Oh and the most in the playoffs. By 42. 
+ Huge advantage: **Steph Curry**

________

**3) Scoring**

+ They are both equally as skilled around the basket when it comes to finish. Paul absorbs contact better (or at least more consistently) and is craftier with those bank shots (sorry, San Antonio), whereas Curry has all kinds of spins, floaters, scoops and rainbows that make him the fucking Baskin Robbins of finishing around the rim.
+ True shooting wise, which measures the efficiency of scoring, Curry is just slightly ahead of Paul, probably due in part to his more accurate three point shooting. 
+ They each have their signature moves: Curry with the firecracker, electrify the crowd, this-is-straight-of-a-streetballer's-wet-dream pull up three; Paul with the, ""I don't care if I'm 6'0 and 180lbs, fuck you I'm Chris Paul"" off-the-dribble elbow jumper. Both are effective, though off-the-dribble three point shooting is just statistically more likely to go cold for longer stretches. But when Curry is hot, his signature move is unstoppable and significantly more demoralizing than Paul's, though the Spurs might have something to say about that.
+ Honestly, they score in different ways, and while Curry is more prone to go for 50 than CP3, Paul can take over at any given point and can often times subtly score 30 through a collection of tough midrange jays and timely threes. When Curry's going off, you know he's going off. With Paul it's subtle. Plus his scoring is good enough where you have to choose whether you want him to hang 40 on you or hang 15 assists on you. With Curry, 40 spells almost certain doom. This one comes down to preference.
+ Advantage: **wash**

________

**4) Handles**

+ Well, there isn't exactly a concrete way or statistical way to measure this. But Paul's found himself on the other end of Curry highlights a couple too many times. The way I like to think of it is that Curry has the ball on a string and does what he pleases with his dribble moves, weaving, awing, and just flat out dominating. Paul's hands are a prison and the ball is trapped within it. He does less, but at times he's much safer about his dribbling.
+ Paul can protect the ball and control it at the transcendent level required for a top point guard of all-time, which leads to less turnovers. Curry could easily control the ball more, but his game is much more predicated on the dazzle of it all. Curry's a magician. Sleight of hand. The turn. The prestige. But make no mistake, there is substance to his style, and if he can further refine when (to dazzle) and how (to use it most efficiently), this won't even be a discussion anymore. As it is...
+ Slight advantage: **Curry**

__________

**5) Defense**

+ Holy shit. Just holy shit. Paul's defense, both effort, skill, lateral quickness, ability to play passing lanes, pickpocketing skills... he has it all. While he has lost a bit and is not as quick as he was before his knee injury, Paul can still defend every point guard in the league admirably, even if it means getting crossed up every now and again. Plus a career DRTG of 104 is very, very impressive. 
+ Curry used to be a bad defender, letting defenders cut by him, letting himself take plays off, but he quickly improved his help defense and is a solid presence on the court. He plays passing lanes well and gets a good jump on the ball. Paul is just a little bit better in that aspect. And a lot better in others. Plus he has that eye test intangible of absolute abandon and tenacity on D.
+ Huge advantage: **Paul**

_________

**6) Versatility**

+ Curry is not the one trick pony we know him to be, that's for sure. He can lead a team and create in many ways. Plus he has that undeniable gravity to his game. He could be 0-21 but you would never dare leave him open, lest you find yourself looking worse than Sheed in '05. He sees the defense well and passes it well, whether it be to Splash Bro Klay or the Bogue-ster (just made that up, sorry). The Warriors were an elite offensive team this year, and Curry was the lead star. Is that Kerr/Gentry's scheme or is it Curry? Probably both. But he ran it beautifully and played to his strengths.
+ 123 ORTG? What. CP3 has regularly led an elite offensive in the Clippers every year he's been there and was the driving force behind a potent attack in NOLA as well. He commands a team and runs whatever scheme fits the other players best. He also plays to his strengths, which happen to be all of them. Stick Paul into any offense and they'd be improved. Even Golden State. Not by much, but by a little.
+ Curry would also improve many offenses. He just has to be the focus. On a team like the Clippers or the Cavs, he would be able to score and command the offense, but cohesion with any player, in almost any system, is lacking. This comes down to somewhat of a preference- rook or slightly nerfed queen? Curry explodes when in the right situation; Paul can do it all, as a queen moves all over the chess border, though he can't quite go all the way as a rook does (say the queen had a 5 space max in every direction). Also yes, that was a double entendre. But this question is about versatility after all.
+ Slight advantage: **Paul**

_________

**7) The Next Level**

+ Back to the versatility thing; Chris Paul may be running a top level offense every year, but consistency is nothing if you never peak.
+ Curry is peaking, and hey, Paul did in 08 and 09, averaging 11.6 and 11 assists respectively, along with 17.8 and 18.3 win-shares, but Curry peaked on a top 10 team of all-time. He won 67 games and went 16-5 in the playoffs against three 53+ win teams and the other four members of the All-NBA 1st Team. 
+ He averaged 28.3 points in the playoffs, and probably would have averaged 30 if he hadn't turned in a dud of a Game 2 in the Finals. 
+ Curry has an MVP, and while Paul definitely deserved one in 2008, he is soaring. We expect the same consistency out of Paul next season, but we can definitely see Curry taking it up even another notch. And that's too scary to ignore.
+ Advantage: **Curry**

__________

**8) Fuck You Factor**

+ Before the Finals, I had this all on CP3. I mean, that scowl on his face and that intense look he gets when he's priming to go off? That's got a big ""fuck you"" written all over it. Plus the Hammy game. That's an all-time great performance. And many more instances where he realized that his bench was terrible and that he had knee problems, not back ones. He just took over, and I wish he did it more, but it's definitely there and it's definitely scary.
+ But then Curry did something so savage. In a span of four minutes in Game 5, he turned Matthew Dellavedova from unsung hero into the recipient of the biggest stink face since Brandon Knight. Dear God. I don't really like Steph Curry because of what he did to Georgetown and I like to hold 7 year grudges but man, he said ""Fuck you Delly, fuck you r/NBA, and fuck you too Michael Jordan."" That's impressive. 
+ Still, Paul has a history of it, and for me, plays like the DJ-shoot-the-fucking-ball and the Dwight-tackle, have that factor in spades. But... Curry did it in the Finals. In a must-win Game 5. In the face of his fuckboy defender. On a shot I don't think I've even seen in a 2K montage. Steph could have shat in my backyard the very same day and that shot still would have been fire. And his attitude is getting there too.
+ Slight advantage: **Curry**

___________

**9) Meaning to His City/Cities and the Game**

+ In NOLA, Chris Paul was in the DWade/Lebron/Duncan/Kobe/Nash/Dirk tier, but when he landed in LAC, he became the second fiddle in what will always be Kobe's city. Still, he is beloved in LAC and they wouldn't trade him for anything except maybe Lebron and Kyrie together. He brought basketball to OKC, he and Drew Brees were the unbroken levies in a broken city rebuilding in the aftermath of Hurrican Katrina, and he has played with heart and passion for years. That 61 point game in honor of his grandpa's 61 years of life... incredible. 
+ Today, after bringing a historic season to the Bay Area and winning MVP, I'm pretty sure (to quote Bill Simmons) they'd trade the Golden Gate Bridge before Steph Curry. He is beloved by the media, by the fans, and comes from a family that the NBA wants to be their classier version of the Kardashians. Just wait till Seth makes the NBA again and has a kid marginally less adorable than Riley. 
+ Curry's the hero; Paul's the villain. It's what makes this debate so fun. But, it has been said that you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. And that's what happened to CP3. But the thing about the NBA is that you don't become a villain by just being around for a long time; you have to be *good* for that long. 
+ Slight advantage: **Paul**

&#x200B;

 Jalen not in bold

I spoke to Rose on Wednesday, before Game 3 of the Finals, which he was covering from Oakland. I had been interested in talking about his basketball and media career, but I started by asking him about the analytics movement, which has revolutionized most major sports, and Rose and I spent most of our conversation discussing it. During the interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed the racial dynamics that he sees underlying various sports debates, the good and the bad of the so-called “player-empowerment era,” and whether he was kidding when he recently went on television and [cast doubt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_ce4QGqiNw) on the moon landing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**It seems to me that a lot of ex-players don’t like the increasing focus on analytics and advanced stats in the conversation around sports. Do you think that is fair as a generalization, and if so, why do you think that is?**

&#x200B;

Oh, wow, you are going to start off with a don’t-get-fired topic that I am going to pull you behind the curtain on, if you really want to know the impetus behind the backlash.

&#x200B;

**I’m all ears.**

&#x200B;

No. 1, there are many people that feel like it has a cultural overtone to it that basically suggests that, even though I may not have played and you did, I am smarter than you, and I know some things that you don’t know, and the numbers support me, not you. Two, you notice that, when it is a powerful job in sports—whether it is an owner, whether it is a president, whether it is a general manager, whether it is a coach—usually in football and basketball, sports that are primarily dominated by black Americans, it’s also an opportunity to funnel jobs to people by saying that, “I am smarter than you because the numbers back up what I say, and I am more read. I study more. I am able to take these numbers and manipulate my point.” It’s almost like when you hear that a player doesn’t have experience at doing X job. People that normally get the jobs you are describing don’t, either. They didn’t play at most levels, but that suffices as their “experience” and validates their opportunity for power.

&#x200B;

**Just to be clear, when you say “cultural overtones,” you mean racial overtones?**

&#x200B;

Correct. And one other point I want to make with that: it is laughable to me when playing experience gets equated to any other type of experience, including coaching. When you play—for example, somebody like me, who has been playing my entire life—for some strange reason that experience gets diminished when it’s time to talk about powerful positions in sports—like, He doesn’t have experience. There is no bigger experience than being in the foxhole, in the huddles, and out on the floor—being a part of the game plan and being game-planned against. But also all the people you learn from: your teammates, the coaches, how to navigate with the media, how to navigate with the fans. Instead of it being, He doesn’t have experience, it really should be, He has more experience than almost anybody walking the earth.

&#x200B;

**When you say “manipulate,” do you think that analytics people are doing something dishonest for their own ends, or do you just think they don’t have the experience? “Manipulate” is a loaded word.**

&#x200B;

I am saying it becomes an entry point, a validation.

&#x200B;

And let me say this: I give myself a forehead slap like the Three Stooges when I hear players and ex-players say that somebody can’t cover the game that didn’t actually play the game. That is also extremely incorrect. Just because you played the game, that doesn’t mean that you are best at analyzing the game, or coaching the game, or working in the front office. It’s the totality of the individual that allows special people to be able to juggle and be successful at both.

&#x200B;

**For many years, political reporters would go out to some diner in Pennsylvania, and they were really experienced at travelling and meeting people and reporting their opinions. More recently, statistics experts and polling experts came in—like Nate Silver, who works at your company—and they basically said that, rather than going to diners, we can learn a lot about the American electorate and voting patterns by analyzing data in a complex way. Even though a lot of these people have no experience reporting, they have incredible insight into the American electorate. I wonder if you think that is a fair comparison.**

&#x200B;

I think what you say does make sense. I appreciate the example. It’s a great one. However, numbers can be manipulated. Look no further than our current election and how it played out. If you were paying attention to all the polls, we would not have thought that the result would end up being \[what it was\], if you are going only by the numbers. Numbers can be manipulated. Statistics for me are things you can count: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals. Analytics are things that you quantify: player-efficiency rating (P.E.R.), usage, net whatever. I think analytics should be a tool in the box, not the actual toolbox.

&#x200B;

**Right, but everything except points, such as rebounds, assists, blocks, steals—all these things are ways of analyzing the goal of the game, which is scoring more points than your opponent. So even if it is a more complex formula like P.E.R., it’s still the same thing. It’s just a more complex and accurate version of what people have been doing forever, which is looking at box scores.**

&#x200B;

The stats that I just described, for example, for me, they physically take place. I can physically watch a game and see them. By the way, I am not a big stats guy. I am an impact person.

&#x200B;

**Meaning?**

&#x200B;

I know just because you had five steals doesn’t mean you are a great defensive player.

Among various discussions on nba reddit, I'm surprised to see how many people don't understand the incredible importance of efficiency. Some definitely get it, but others clearly don't understand. 


There is also a significant overrating of raw scoring, while it is definitely valuable, on it's own without taking into context the efficiency of the scoring it is easy to overrate how valuable it is. 


This is primarily in response to comments in a specific thread regarding a question about 00-01 Lakers vs current warriors where a comment was made that the Lakers had two players then (Shaq and Kobe) better than any player on the warriors (Curry).
Then a discussion ensued where comments were made that essentially curry's efficiency is very overrated/irrelevant. 


Now this isn't to spark some thread about Kobe vs Curry, blah blah etc., so please if you're a huge Kobe or Shaq fan don't take this as a shot at them because it completely isn't. I love kobe/shaq. This is to help highlight just how incredibly important efficiency is, and I'm using this an example since it was recently relevant to a discussion. 


Basketball is a team sport, what's ultimately important is how much a player is helping their TEAM score as many points on the team's number of possessions per game. Then of course on the flip side how much a person helps their team stop the opposing team from scoring on their number of possessions per game. 


It doesn't matter how impressive the scoring ""looks"" from a viewer standpoint or how much effort or willpower it takes that player to score those points. What matters is how it's ultimately impacting the team. 


First, the ""amount"" of points a player scores, on it's own isn't valuable. There are a finite amount of possessions a team has in a game. If a star player is injured or leaves a team, the shot attempts he took don't just disappear. 


What IS valuable is: 

1. How much more efficiently that player scores on his shot attempts compared to how efficiently the team could score those shot attempts without him. 

2. How much more efficiently that player helps his teammates score 
 

Now I'm going to break down the difference in value of Shaq and Kobe's regular season numbers in 2000-2001 compared to Curry's right now. (Now while I find it unlikely he maintains this rate of scoring and efficiency, the discussion was related to how curry is playing currently). 


In the 2000-2001 season: 
Shaq averaged 28.7 points on a TS% of 57.4  

Kobe averaged 28.5 points on a TS% of 55.2

Not including tonight's game since it isn't updated yet on Bballreference:
 
Curry is averaging 31.9 points on a TS% of 69.1
 
Now as I mentioned previously, when a player is gone those shot attempts don't disappear and the offense adapts.  
Now, even if you removed one of these players from let's say the 0-18 sixers, a team that is intentionally tanking, that offense is still going to find a way to convert those shots at a TS% of 50.2(sixers current TS%). So the actual ""Real"" value of the player's scoring is the difference between that player's efficiency on those shots and the team's efficiency on those shots without him. 


Now the actual math for this will be off some decimal points because TS% isn't 100% exact as there is a coefficient for free throws that don't use up a possession such as technicals and and-1's. 



In 2000-2001 Shaq took 19.1 FGA and 13.1 FTA. Now since 2 free throws is approximately 1 possession, I'm going to cut them in half to come up with a generally close approximation of how many ""shot possessions"" Shaq used. 
19.1 + 6.5  would be essentially 25.6 ""Shot possessions"" that Shaq used to score his 28.7 points. 

Now if you're not that great with numbers and want to know more in depth how this is calculated I don't mind posting in the comments how, it's relatively simple. Just wanted to save from using up even more space as this post is long enough. 

Now if you take those 25.6 ""Shot possessions"" Shaq used and convert them to how many points the Sixers would score on those possessions(a TS% of 50.2) you will get approximately 25.8 points.

Shaq averaged 28.7, a difference of 2.9. I'll give a margin of error of .5 points because of the TS% coefficient. 

So although Shaq averaged 28.7 PPG, the ""Real"" Value of that scoring to even the 0-18 sixers is about  3 - 3.5 points. Then there's also value in how efficiently Shaq helps his teammates score with his presence and attention which would be another couple points or so. 
 
Shaq's OBPM that year was 5.7, now while it's not a perfect stat, it's  the only one that spans decades for a comparison and is still a general good predictor. When also taking into account the value of his actual scoring as I previously calculated at 3-3.5 points, an OBPM of 5.7 seems reasonable.

If you do the same math for Kobe in 00-01:

He scored 28.5 points on 26.3 ""Shot possessions""

At a TS% of 50.2, the sixers would score approximately 26.4 points on those shots, a difference of 2.1. So with a margin of error, the actual ""Real"" value of Kobe's points were 2-2.7 points.
Then he has added value helping his teammate's score efficiently. His OBPM that year was 5.3


Now for Stephen Curry: Curry is scoring 32.1 points on about 23.5 ""shot possessions""

On those same shot attempts the sixers would score roughly 23.6 points.

An astounding difference of 8.5

So with a Margin of error the ""Real"" Value Of Curry's current scoring is 8.5 - 9 points. Then he also has the added value of how much his presence helps his teammates score efficiently. His OBPM is currently 12.9

That is how INSANLEY valuable efficiency is. The actual value of Curry's Current scoring(8.5-9 points) is greater than Shaq and Kobe's that year COMBINED (5 - 6.2). His OBPM currently (12.9) is also greater than Shaq and Kobe's that year combined (11.2)


To provide even further support (the TEAM's offense) that these players are impacting, the Warriors right now are on pace to have the best offense of all time.


Their offensive rating right now: 115.6

The Lakers offensive rating in 2000-2001: 108.4

A team with Shaq and Kobe is scoring an astronomical 7.2 points less per 100 possessions than the Curry led Warriors.

I don't care though. I just want to express my thoughts on this whole suspension incident.

So, it seems like every other post in the last 48 hours has been about either how dirty and disrespectful it was of Lebron to step over Draymond, or more recently about how ridiculous the suspension is. Let me get this straight: People are saying that because Lebron stepped over Green (sure, a little disrespectfully) that Draymond's act of slapping Lebron directly in the nuts is entirely justified. 

I just don't get it. We're talking about Draymond Green here, the guy who just a couple weeks ago blatantly kicked Steven Adams in the nuts. And a few days before that kneed him in the nuts. I respect him as a player, but the fact is that he's pretty dirty and occasionally reckless. There are tons of other incidents of his over-physicality and recklessness. Even in these playoffs, to name one, when he threw Michael Beasley to the ground at the end of game
3 of the Houston series. I don't understand where the justification is coming from here. Why in the world are people saying this suspension is BS?? Draymond Green blatantly and intentionally slapped Lebron James in the balls. I think that warrants a suspension.

Now, I understand the notion that the suspension is ridiculous because Draymond didn't get suspended for the kick to Adams last series. I certainly think he should have been suspended for that, but that doesn't make me criticize the NBA for their decision on this incident. Why would they make the same mistake twice? It boils down to this: Draymond Green slapped Lebron James in the nuts. Can someone please explain to me why this suspension is in any way ridiculous?",0.57,controversial,6/13/16 10:52
699,Bill Simmons is so bad at understanding the modern basketball that it’s beyond ridiculous,0,c1rc8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c1rc8j/bill_simmons_is_so_bad_at_understanding_the/,60,1560825783,"I’m really happy for him finding a way to build his own great content product in Ringer, but he’s so bad at understanding the modern game that it’s beyond ridiculous right now.

Last year he was really owned by Bob Voulgaris in Rockets vs Celtics situations stuff, but you could call him being biased, because he’s a fan on one of those teams. 

But at his latest podcast he went even further.

He claimed that Jrue, Lonzo, Ingram and Zion Team is a western conference caliber playoff team. After that he corrected himself, claiming that they are “one move away”, talking about bringing rim protection.

I mean how could you believe in a claim like that seriously, when Jrue is by far their best 3PT shooter among those guys and so-called rim protector, making less than 2FG’s per game on 35% shooting?

Especially after talking for half of an hour approximately about the Lakers, their mess over the last couple of seasons, especially the last one, where the - TA-DAM - lack of consistent shooting clearly ran that team straight into the ground.

I’m cool with him picking 65+ wins for the Boston team, he’s a well-known Celtics homer, but naming the guys and clearly being unable to recognize the weaknesses on a fly is just terrible, especially when you are talking about the potential team around Zion, who’s like Giannis or LeBron is going to get doubled since late October because of how freakishly athletic he really is.

That just sad. He’s great at running Ringer, but he has been so bad at basketball for the last couple of years that it clearly deserves consideration, I know he’s reading it.",0.49,controversial,6/17/19 19:43
700,Some Observations about Durant + Westbrook,0,4r1sp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4r1sp3/some_observations_about_durant_westbrook/,50,1467576950,"Over the past two seasons, the Thunder have gone 29-36 in games Durant missed.  That's a 37 win pace.

In games Durant played, they had a 57 win pace.

With Durant limited to just 27 games in 2014-15, the Thunder had a losing record in games Durant missed and **failed to make the playoffs** (playing at their typical 57 win pace in games Durant played).   

Not surprisingly, Westbrook's efficiency dropped that season to 42% from FG and 29% from the line.  It seems Durant's presence has a positive effect on Westbrook's efficiency.

Based on this limited sample size, one could make the case that the Thunder, without Durant, would struggle to make the playoffs and might even finish below .500.

One note:  Westbrook missed time that season as well.  I primarily looked at games Durant missed.  But the fact is, with Durant healthy they played at their typical 57 win pace.  Even with him playing 27 games (1/3rd of the season), the Thunder were a lottery team without a fully healthy Durant.  You could make the argument that Durant could join a 48 win team like the Celtics and they'd be more successful than the Thunder this season since the Durantless Celtics might compare favorably to the Durantless Thunder.

-----

How about the reverse? 

Well in 2013-14, Westbrook was limited to just 46 games.  In the 36 games he missed, the Thunder went 25-11 (including a 10 game win streak) - their typical 57 win pace.  The Thunder won 59 games that season in spite of Westbrook missing significant time.  

Additionally, Westbrook's absence seemed to have no negative effect on Durant's production.  In the 35 games Durant played without Westbrook, he put up averages of 32.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.2 steals, 51%/41%/89% shooting in 37.6mpg.   And for the full season, he posted career highs in points and assists - with no noticeable downtick in efficiency.

Based on this limited sample size, one could make the case that the Russell Westbrook's impact on Kevin Durant is similar to the impact Monta Ellis had on Steph Curry.  We might actually see Durant flourish without Westbrook (who has the highest usage rate in the league and has an assist/turnover rate that is 28th in the league).  

----

I understand the common narrative is that because the Thunder had limited success and Westbrook is a Superstar, Durant needs to play with Westbrook to be successful.  Unfortunately, the reality is that the Thunder were likely successful **BECAUSE OF DURANT**.  We once saw LeBron James win 66 games with Mo Williams as his 2nd best player.  Once he left, the Cavs were a 20 win team.  Do not discount the possibility that Durant, a legitimate Superstar, is the primary reason for the Thunder's success - and he may see even greater success by going to a team that has more complimentary pieces.  

-----

**TL:DR:  Based on a limited sample size... Durant + Westbrook = 57 win pace.  Westbrook without Durant = 37 win pace.   Durant without Westbrook = 57 win pace**",0.49,controversial,7/3/16 13:15

I've been swallowing my comments day in and day out while /r/nba hops on hivemind thought after hivemind thought about whatever random trend is occurring.  In the big scheme of things, I don't mind at all, because /r/nba is always top notch in delivering player news and any other general news regarding the NBA.  /r/nba is first, and /r/nba is the best.  This is your/our shtick, and the community has it down.
Now
..
I've been reading Simmons for years now and he's a very, very entertaining, passionate fan and writer.  He loves the NBA, he loves sports, he loves pop culture, and he's a great read.  He's Entertaining.  Take him with several grains of salt and he's always fun to ingest.
BUT..
/r/nba has taken it to the next level.  You guys have begun taking whatever he says as canon and shouting it repeatedly and downvoting anyone to hell who doesn't agree.  This is bullshit.  Pure, unadulterated, bullshit.

Bill Simmons has been a self professed biased, conspiracy theory loving, drama seeking, storyline creating (even when one doesn't exist) writer Ever Since He Begun Writing.  People who have been reading him for years ARE USED TO IT.  We laugh at it.  Hell, I happily read Grantland daily, and have done so for years.  Years!  I am seriously wondering how many who are touting his words as gospel have even been closely watching the NBA for years.  I remember watching Kings (I am not even a Kings fan) league pass games well into the night and waking up the next morning to him giving incorrect assessments of what happened in those games down the stretch.  He's a good writer, but he will absolutely turn events to a way where it's exciting to read about and sometimes might not have happened.  We (longtime Simmons readers) Know to take it with many grains of salt.  ALL OF THE SUDDEN, after being introduced to this terrible ESPN crew, people are randomly taking his word as gospel.  It Is Not.  Some of it is great, and some of it is wrong.

Bill Simmons is a great fan, but he also interprets scenarios wrong and creates drama and storylines where none exist.  He pushes his agenda, like when he tries to promote one player over another and argues this assertion by recounting all the ""possible"" championships that a player ""should"" have (ala Tim Duncan, when he recounts all the ""once in a lifetime"" things that had to happen to keep him from several of his potential other championships... yet doesn't do the same argument [an argument that can easily be made] for other players) and says this should theoretically count towards a players legacy.  This is his thing.  He loves conjecture.  And That Is Okay!

What he is doing with Doc is conjecture and Celtics love mixed with heartbreak that his team is tearing apart.  It's clear that Doc and he now have bad blood, but for everyone to Immediately hop on his side as if he's done NOTHING wrong in ""calling out a coach"" who did nothing wrong besides seeking new employment is downright stupid.  Their beef now is strong, and I see both parties' point, in a manner.  Yet, the initial problem with Doc being offended at Simmons taking aim at him is absolutely valid.  No matter how much you guys want to love Everything Bill Simmons does: you need to relax.  There's a happy medium where you don't have to downvote every comment that doesn't praise him to being below threshold, where you can have an open enough mind to realize the situation from both sides.

If you have been following he Heat at all the last couple years you know the second half of the season is turn up time. Everyone knows about the Heats record being exactly the same come this time each year of the big three etc. Now is always the time line rotations are solid and things begin to click. I'm almost positive a big win streak is coming and willing to come back on this post in the future. Just curious on some thoughts or maybe bets people are willing to make on this win streak? Also Heats play lately. Bosh has been playing arguably his best ball of his career for stretches. Wade seems completely comfortable out there and playing the best stretch of ball he has also played in a long time. Chalmers has also been, in my opinion, one of the most important pieces to the Heat of late and Lebron has CLEARLY turned it post all star despite the broken nose clearly making a statement game vs Durant.  Oden getting his first start in 4 years and becoming a factor. Battier getting his shot back etc. I feel a big push / possible number 1 seed.

703,[Serious] Why Are People Against Kawhi?,1,8d2b0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8d2b0p/serious_why_are_people_against_kawhi/,92,1524047650,"Genuinely curious why it seems like quite a few people on this sub seem to side with the Spurs in this situation. This is all based on the information we as fans have, we obviously don't know EXACTLY what's going on. 

No one knows how Kawhi's body is feeling except for Kawhi, not even a team doctor. The fact that Tony Parker brought up his injury and said it was much worse was extremely disrespectful from my point of view. 

Kawhi has an outside medical team looking at his injury and they have not cleared him. This isn't his uncle saying he isn't healthy but trained professionals just like the team's doctors. This isn't to say that team doctors are compromised in any way but they definitely look out for the team and if it seems like Kawhi is say 95% ready they would probably clear him, while there is no incentive for an outside medical team to have any agenda. 

There have been players who have played through an injury and it ended up being a terrible decision. IT is a recent example of this. Yes, he also played due to personal reasons as he said it helped him cope with the death of his sister but he also wishes he got surgery sooner rather than play through it as it affected his play which is lowering his value. I don't think he would have ever gotten a max contract but it sure as hell would have been higher than what he's going to get now. If he sat out for the whole year coming off his play in Boston, it's likely he would have gotten more than he's gonna get now. 

The Spurs organization has been a model organization for the past 20 years but taking subtle shots at Kawhi is extremely unprofessional. If he doesn't feel ready, it's as simple as that. He isn't ready to play. They obviously want him to play because they pay him to play basketball and they need him to be an actual threat in the West. So while they care to have Kawhi healthy because he's their Super-Star player and want him to be healthy for years to come, they have an agenda in they also need him to play as soon as possible. While an outside medical staff has none of that and only want to get Kawhi healthy. 

Kawhi isn't ""quitting"" on his team just because he doesn't feel ready to play. I can also guarantee the subtle shots aren't motivating him to return either but rather more of a reason for him to stay away from playing until he's fully 100%. 

edit: TLDR; Kawhi doesn't feel 100% healthy and his outside medical staff who have absolutely no agenda aside from getting him healthy have not cleared him. The subtle shots from the Spurs are unprofessional and aren't going to encourage him to come back. There's no reason to think Kawhi is simply ""quitting"" on the team with the information we have.",0.51,controversial,4/18/18 3:34
704,NBA 2019-2020 Power Rankings,0,cd0xe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/cd0xe9/nba_20192020_power_rankings/,42,1563123463,"This upcoming season is shaping up to be one of the best ever.  Parity is back in the NBA!

After a whirlwind off season - surely the craziest in NBA history - I'd like to share my predictions for each team as I see them and create a ""way too early"" Power Rankings.  Without further ado...

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Denver Nuggets** \- I may be biased, but people are absolutely sleeping on Denver.  While they had a quiet off season, the addition of Jerami Grant was the perfect compliment to their already young and deep roster.  Toting the best center in the game in Nikola Jokic, Denver runs one of the best offenses in the NBA predicated on ball and player movement. They will be elite both offensively and defensively.  Jamal Murray will make his case for a top 5 PG in the game next season.  While other teams in the West made huge splashes, the Nuggets didn't need to.  They are absolutely deep and talented at every position.  Denver was the 2 seed last season and almost (should have) made it to the WCF.  Aside from having the best young core in the league, they also have the most intriguing prospect outside of Zion in Michael Porter Jr.  The playoff run they had last season was invaluable experience.  Watch out for the Nuggets.
2. **Los Angeles Clippers** \- Kawhi Leonard and Paul George is a ridiculous tandem on both ends of the floor.  Both are elite offense players and lock-down wing defenders.  Aside from these two, the Clippers are deep with players such as Patrick Beverly, Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Ivica Zubac, and Landry Shamet.  The defensive trio of Bev/Klaw/PG13 is scary.  Lou Williams will continue to be the perfect 6th man and will be vital to ensure two elite offensive players are on the floor at all times.  I love the energy and competitiveness of Harrell, and the Clips have two great young players in Zubac and Shamet.  Shamet is the closest thing to Curry we've seen yet.  Doc Rivers is still one of the better coaches in the league and will have the respect of Kawhi and PG13.  If I can find an issue that this team may have it would be playmaking, as both of their stars aren't know to create much for others.
3. **Los Angeles Lakers** \- The Clippers and Lakers are now 1A and 1B in Los Angeles. LeBron James and Anthony Davis are arguably the best pair of teammates to ever play together.  People forget about AD.  Anthony Davis is absolutely dominant and I look forward to him reminding people of that this season.  He is unbelievably good, and if you didn't know already, LeBron is still that guy.  They missed out on Kawhi, but they sure made up for it in Free Agency.  The Lakers filled out their roster with the likes of Cousins, Danny Green, Bradley, KCP, Rondo, and McGee, while retaining one of the best young players in the game in Kuzma.  It'll be fun to see how they all play together, but this team looks very strong on paper.  Some sports books in Vegas now have the Lakers as the favorite to win it all.
4. **Milwaukee Bucks** \- Fear the Deer.  While the West has exploded, the Bucks are on top in the East for now.  Milwaukee dominated last season in both the regular season and playoffs.  Reigning MVP Giannis will be even better and their core stayed intact minus Brodgon.  Losing Brogon was a significant hit for them, but they still have Bledsoe and Hill at the PG, and they picked up Wesley Matthews which is a sneaky good add.  Khris Middleton continues to make his case as an elite SG, and they retained Brook ""Splash Mountain"" Lopez.  The Bucks also have a great coach and offensive system, to go along with tremendous length on the defensive end.  A number of teams will challenge them in the East next season, but I wouldn't underestimate the Bucks in the East while the West dukes it out with each other.
5. **Philadelphia 76ers** \- Philly has a mind-boggling starting 5 now.  Simmons, Richardson, Harris, Horford, Embiid.  Here is the height of their starting lineup:  6'10, 6'6, 6'9, 6'10, 7'0.  Yikes.  Reddick (and Butler) were losses for them, but Richardson is a major improvement at SG (way better defender, still a very good shooter), and the addition of Horford is amazing.  Al Horford is one of the best overall players in the league and surely underrated, both on the court and in the locker room.  This team will be a problem, but it will have to be seen how they mesh together.  Their bench is questionable to say the least.  I guess Mike Scott is the 6th best player now.  I'm not sold on the Sixers just yet, but their starting 5 is probably the best in the league.
6. **Utah Jazz** \- The Jazz, like the Nuggets, are being slept on by most of the national media.  They were the #1 defensive team in the league last season.  They struggled on offense in the playoffs when Mitchell was the sole option on most plays.  Adding Conley is the absolute nut add for this team.  Conley adds another offensive weapon and clutch performer to relieve Mitchell of playmaking duties down the stretch.  He is also an elite individual defender and a good culture guy that will fit right in.  I like Rubio, too, but Conley fits so much better with this group, I was really happy to see him go to Utah.  Aside from Conley, they are well coached and know how to move the ball.  Joe Ingles is an underrated SF who will be better when he can kick out to Conley instead of Rubio to space the floor.  These guys are young too and have real chemistry.  I wouldn't be surprised to see the Stifle Tower and Co. secure a 3rd or 4th seed in the West.
7. **Houston Rockets** \- Westbrook to the Rockets, Wow!  It's an amazing time to be an NBA fan.  Following this FA has been crazy, I can't think of a time when so many teams were loading up.  I can't wait to see how this team will mesh, but I'm not quite sold yet that they will.  Westbrook and Harden were the #1 and #2 highest usage % players in the league the last 5 seasons.  Something has to give.  Harden had almost 0 assisted field goals last year, and Westbrook is not a good spot up shooter.  They will have to change their style, but I am excited to see how it works.  They still have a very good young center in Capela, and a dark horse 6th man of the year candidate in Eric Gordon.  I'd like to see Westbrook pushing the pace up the floor and running with Capela, with Harden getting the ball later in the shot clock.  We will see if Harden can adapt his game to play more SG and move without the ball... something he has been notorious for not doing.  Regardless, the Rockets will have two MVPs now who are hungry for success.
8. **Golden State Warriors** \- Maybe I'm sleeping on the Warriors, or maybe the NBA is just that stacked.  The Warriors lost Kevin Durant, but they still have Curry, Klay, and Draymond.  Plus they've added Russell and solid backups in Burks and Cauley-Stein.  The Warriors should absolutely still be in the mix, and if they are, Curry has a very good shot at MVP.  It will be interesting to see how well Kerr coaches this team and adjusts to these changes.  D-Lo is someone I never imagined on the Warriors, but I guess I didn't envision Durant or Cousins joining them, either.  One thing for sure is he is one of the best young players in the league and should be on his best behavior with the Warriors.  I am higher on Cauley-Stein than most, and Draymond should be a good mentor for him.  Their bench is questionable (though it has been) and Klay will be out for the first part of the season.
9. **Portland Trail Blazers** \- Dame and McCollum showed last season that they are definitely in the discussion for the best back court in the league.  Unfortunately for them, Nurkic was out during their playoff run.  Those guys are all in their primes and have a wealth of experience together.  Portland got rid of their long wings in Harkless and Aminu, but they added much needed scoring and defensive presence on the wing in Kent Bazemore.  I also like their pick up of Mario Hezonja, a talented player that hasn't had much of a shot in the league so far.  Lastly, they acquired Hassan Whiteside which would have been more of a blockbuster move a couple years ago, but even now it is a significant addition.  Whiteside should be on his best behavior in Portland where he even knows that he's not the best player on the team.  The Blazers are very good and should fight for 50+ wins next season.
10. **Boston Celtics** \- Boston is under the radar once again, just where they want to be.  While Kemba isn't exactly an upgrade over Kyrie, he should be a superior compliment to this team as an All-NBA PG without any drama/leadership issues.  Kemba should fit Boston's offense perfectly; he is an excellent catch-and-shoot player and extremely fast with the ball.  Losing Horford is significant, I would have Boston higher if they still held on to Al.  With that being said, Kanter is a decent pick up (they needed rebounding) and probably a better team defender then he gets credit for. Hayward should have a much better year this time around, as well as Tatum and Brown.  Locker room chemistry is vital - especially for young guys - and they just didn't have it last season.  Brad Stevens is still one of the best coaches in the NBA. Players should buy into his system 100% this season, I fully expect Boston to be top 4 in the East.
11. **Brooklyn Nets** \- Brooklyn already had many young, talented players (Dinwiddie, Harris, LeVert, Allen) before adding Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  Not to mention Taurean Prince (underrated signing) and DeAndre Jordan (overrated signing).  They are well coached and will compete with anyone.  If Durant wasn't injured for the year, the Nets could be the best team in the East.  Even without Durant, however, this team will be very good.  I can't see Kyrie having the same kind of negative effect on this team as he did in Boston... but who knows.  Irving is a superstar PG that will have very good shooters around him and a young big man in Jarrett Allen with all the promise in the world.  When D-Lo was injured, Dinwiddie stepped up and was the best player on the team for a stretch of time.  The Nets will definitely make the playoffs, and if KD can come back during that time they have a real shot at making it to the Finals.
12. **Indiana Pacers** \- I love the way this team has re-tooled.  The Pacers were very good the last couple of years, even when Oladipo was out.  They are tenacious on defense and play well together offensively.  Indiana almost made a real run in the playoffs when Oladipo was healthy.  They lost Bogan Bogdanovic which hurts, but they picked up TJ Warren to replace him.  Malcolm Brogdon joined this team which creates a formidable backcourt alongside Oladipo.  I absolutely love Sabonis, and Myles Turner is set to have a career year next season.  Another underrated signing is Jeremy Lamb who was arguably the Hornet's best young player after Kemba left.  I may even be underestimating on this projection, but Oladipo will be out at the beginning of the season and it will take some time to build chemistry with so many new faces.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Indiana take as high as a 3 seed in the East.
13. **San Antonio Spurs** \- Death, Taxes, and the Spurs making the playoffs.  While the West this year is absolutely bonkers, I believe the 8 seed is up for grabs between teams like the Spurs, Mavericks, Kings, and maybe Pelicans.  The Spurs were bad defensively (by their standards) last year and they still took the Nuggets to 7 games in the first round.  They will be much better on that end this year as  Dejounte Murray is fully healthy, Derrick White is an absolute menace (the Spurs never disappoint when it comes to developing young guys like White), and the best player in the Summer League, Lonnie Walker IV, becoming a rotational player and defensive stopper.  The NBA is stacked with powerful duos now, and the Spurs still have one in Demar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge.  Marcus Morris would've been a great fit, but picking up Carroll and Lyles (possibly) are good additions as well.
14. **Dallas Mavericks** \- The Mavs are one of the teams that I'm most excited about.  They are extremely well coached  and surprisingly deep.  Porzingis has been injured, but look for him to be a top 15 player next season.  7'3 with a high basketball IQ and excellent shooting touch.  Doncic had one of the best rookie campaigns ever and I expect him to improve upon that after a full year of conditioning, NBA training, etc.  Aside from these two, they picked up Delon Wright (super underrating signing) to play PG and to play defense.  Brunson was great on offense, but between him and Luka the Mavs got scorched.  Tim Hardaway Jr. is the perfect third option on this team, and they also have Justin Jackson and Seth Curry.  The Mavs also resigned both of their young &amp; athletic centers.  This team has filled out nicely and it will be fun to watch Doncic and Porzingis under Rick Carlisle.
15. **New Orleans Pelicans** \- What rebuild?  New Orleans traded the best player they've ever had for a haul of young talent and draft picks, plus lucked out on the #1 draft pick that turned into Zion Williamson.  This team will be good right away.  Lonzo Ball and Jrue Holiday instantly become a lock down defensive back court.  Lonzo should do better on this team away from the spotlight of L.A.  Jrue Holiday is one of the best guards in the game and should be the leader from day 1.  Brandom Ingram should average 20+ PPG this season and cement himself as one of the premier scoring threats in the league.  They also have a lot of shooting in Redick, Hart, Moore, and Miller.  Derrick Favors was another good signing, and Okafor showed signs of life recently.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if this team makes some noise right away and fights for a playoff spot.
16. **Toronto Raptors** \- The defending champions lost both Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.  Still, the rest of their championship core is intact (Lowry, VanVleet, Powell, Siakam, Gasol, Ibaka).  They play well together and have one of the better coaches in the NBA.  While most of the NBA will have to figure out chemistry on the fly, the Raptors already have their continuity.  Of course a team without Kawhi is going to be worse, but the Raptors are still formidable and will make the playoffs next season.  They played well in the games he didn't play last season, and bottom line is that this group knows how to win and play together.  Aging veterans Lowry and Gasol definitely have some left in the tank, and I look for Siakam to take another step and cement himself as the best player on the team.
17. **Sacramento Kings** \- Another sneaky young team who can make some noise this year is the Kings.  De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield make up a young &amp; formidable back court that's gotten better each season.  Buddy Hield shot 43% from 3 last season at around 5 attempts per game, and Fox has a tremendous feel for the game for such a young player, not to mention his quickness and athleticism.  One move that seemed to go under the radar is signing Dewayne Dedmon.  He is a very good center who is still only 29 years old and surely an upgrade from Cauley-Stein.  They resigned Harrison Barnes (meh), still have Bogdon Bogdonovic, picked up Trevor Ariza, and have one of the best young prospects in Marvin Bagley III.  They will be competitive on any given night; we will see how things come together under new head coach Luke Walton.
18. **Phoenix Suns** \- I am higher on the new-look Suns than most.  They have reshaped their roster (and coaching staff) tremendously despite some questionable draft moves.  First of all, Monty Williams is a game changer from a coaching standpoint.  Next, Ricky Rubio was the perfect addition to their team.  He is the ideal PG to play alongside Booker and to set up Ayton and other shooters, plus he is a good defender with size that will help Booker on that end as well.  The Kelly Oubre signing was critical.  He is only 23 years old and a much better of a basketball player than people give him credit for, plus his locker room presence has been crucial in bringing these young guys together.  Mikal Bridges was a steal in last year's draft, and Dario Saric was added as the ideal 4 to play along side Ayton.  Lastly, Aron Baynes as the backup C has been another underrated pickup.  Most importantly, Devin Booker is the best player in the league under 22 years old.  The Suns have real promise now, even if they won't make the playoffs next season.
19. **Miami Heat** \- Josh Richardson is gone, Jimmy Butler is in.  Whiteside is out which solidifies Bam Adebayo's spot as the starting center.  Even though Richardson is a nice young player, Jimmy Butler is definitely an upgrade.  He should flourish in the role of top dog and his competitiveness will be a welcome sight to an already scrappy group of guys. They have good players on this team like Dragic, Winslow, Waiters and Johnson.  I really like their draft pick at #13, Tyler Herro.  We'll see if the Heat upgrade again with the likes of CP3 or Beal, but regardless they will be a competitive team that should make the playoffs, even if their overall talent is a bit lacking compared to most of the league.
20. **Orlando Magic** \- Run it back!  The Magic have basically the same roster as last season except for the addition of Aminu.  They were one of the hottest teams to end last season, as well as one of the best defensively.  Orlando is filled with long, athletic defenders.  Nikola Vucevic is  one of the best centers in the game.  Aaron Gordon is interesting; he is an explosive athlete with a lot of talent that just hasn't seemed to put it together yet.  Issac is their prized young player who they've been very careful with.  This team will be tough if Gordon can put it together and they can stay healthy.
21. **Minnesota Timberwolves** \- The Timberwolves have been one of the most hopeful teams in recent years that have surely failed to meet expectations.  Let's not talk about Wiggins, but Karl-Anthony Towns is an absolute monster!  I look for KAT to finally fully take control of this team and dominate on both ends of the floor.  He absolutely has the ability to be in the discussion for Top 10 players, but he isn't yet.  There's not a whole lot else on this team, but i do really love Robert Covington (the perfect 3 and D player), and I like their guards Napier and Okogie.  They took Culver with the #6 pick in the draft who will likely step in and contribute immediately.
22. **Detroit Pistons** \- Blake Griffin played his heart out last season and gained a lot of people's respect.  Andre Drummond is a beast on the boards and has improved defensively every season.  Problem with the Pistons as I see it is a lack of playmaking guards and wings.  Most of their offense is predicated around dumping the ball off to Griffin and having him create every time.  Reggie Jackson is good but wildly inefficient.  I like the pickup of Derrick Rose, and Markieff Morris wasn't bad either.  Hopefully Luke Kennard can have a breakout season and provide some much needed spacing for this team.
23. **Atlanta Hawks** \- The Hawks are a fun team to watch.  Trae Young has brought a new kind of energy to the team and I'm sure it's an exciting time to be a Hawks fan.  They have a lot of young talent in Young, Huerter, and especially Collins.  John Collins is one of my favorite players in the NBA.  Super athletic and competitive, plus he's only 21 years old!  ATL will continue to improve and be a force in the NBA after some time.  Jabari Parker was an interesting pick up, he is much better than most give him credit for and should have the opportunity to show that here.  Lastly, they drafted De'Andre Hunter with the #4 pick in the draft, he should come in and contribute immediately.
24. **Chicago Bulls** \- Another promising young team.  Lauri Markkanen broke records in his rookie season and now he should be fully healthy and ready to go.  They drafted Coby White who may end up to be a very good PG in this league.  Zach LaVine is supremely talented on the offensive end, I look for him to improve on the other end as well as he continues to develop.  The Bulls had some nice pickups recently -- Otto Porter last season (huge), and Tomas Satoransky and Thaddeus Young in the off season.  Satoransky may be the best PG on the team when the season starts, he filled in nicely on the Wizards when Wall was injured and he seems to be the right compliment to LaVine in the back court.
25. **New York Knicks** \- What an off season!  The Knicks signed KD, Irving, and drafted Zion Williamson with the #1 overall pick.  Oh wait... In all seriousness, the Knicks did alright to fill out their roster with the likes of Julius Randle, Reggie Bullock, Marcus Morris, and Bobby Portis.  Randle should feast on this team.  RJ Barrett and Dennis Smith Jr. is definitely two young players to be excited about.  I also like Allonzo Trier, and Kevin Knox has a high ceiling.  Last but not least, Mitchell Robinson may just lead the league in blocks next year.  The New York Knicks will think they can make the playoffs next season.  We'll see.
26. **Washington Wizards** \- The Wizards are in a tough situation with bloated contracts and specifically John Wall being injured.  With that being said, Bradley Beal is an elite SG and all signs are positive with Wall's progress and recovery.  They also have a solid young center in Thomas Bryant.  I think they should have kept Tomas Satoransky, but they did add some rotational players in CJ Miles and Davis Bertans.  Bertans is one of the purest shooters and hardest working professionals, was sad to see him leave San Antonio but he should do well in Washington.  They drafted Rui Hachimura with the #9 pick and he looks impressive.
27. **Memphis Grizzlies** \- With the #2 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, Memphis Grizzlies select Ja Morant!  This kid may be special.  I was pleased to see him go to the Grizzlies after how professionally they handled breaking up their cornerstones in Conley and Gasol.  Jaren Jackson Jr. is a very good young prospect, I think he will be one of the better players in the league in the coming years.  Outside of these two young guys, you could do worse than Jonas  Valanciunas at center, and I also like Dillon Brooks' game.  The timeline of success for this team should rest on how quick and significant of an impact Morant will have.
28. **Cleveland Cavaliers** \- Annual losers since LeBron left, the Cavs don't have a whole lot going for them.  Kevin Love is still the man on this team, and much of their success will be reliant on Love staying healthy.  Collin Sexton has been good so far and they drafted Darius Garland at #5.  Maybe those two players will become a formidable duo in the back court.  Cedi Osman is a versatile player and an above-average SF.  I've always like Larry Nance Jr. Hope for the Cavs at this point has to be in Sexton and Garland's hands.
29. **Oklahoma City Thunder** \- After losing Paul George and Russell Westbrook, OKC will fall the farthest from contention to bottom dweller.  With that being said, they have a lot of promise with the multitude of first round picks they've acquired and a young prospect named Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.  Chris Paul is likely to be traded, so as it stands this team is pretty thin.   Aside from Shai, Schroder is a decent guard and Danilo Gallinari will become the team's best player.  Steven Adams should have a more dominant impact on the boards.  Sam Presti has always worked magic in the front office, and this season is no different (despite losing PG and Westbrook).
30. **Charlotte Hornets** \- Charlotte lost Kemba and replaced him with Terry Rozier.  I don't hate Rozier but that contract is objectively bad.  Scary Terry is one of the most inefficient players in the league, though I do think he will have a better season this year as the #1 option at PG.  They also lost maybe their best young player in Jeremy Lamb.  Malik Monk should be freed with an unlimited green light on offense.  Plus, maybe we can see more of super-athletic Miles Bridges unlocking his euro step windmill dunk.  Ultimately, the outlook is dire for the Charlotte Hornets; It's ironic that the best player to ever play is the owner of the worst team in the NBA.",0.5,controversial,7/14/19 9:57

Game 3:
Mavericks up 83-71 with 8:30 left. A lot of people claim that the refs took over here and helped guide Wade to victory.
Up to the 3rd quarter Wade had shot 15 free throws. In the 4th quarter, Wade shot only 3 free throws, and only 1 free throw within the 8:30 left. So the two other free throws he shot were before the 12 point lead the Mavs had.

Not to mention with the game score was 97-95 in favor of the Heat with 3 seconds to go and Dirk gets given 2 free throws. So the Mavs were given a chance to tie the game, and Dirk only hit 1 of 2 free throws to make the score 97-96 in favor of the Heat. 

So in actual fact, Wade got no free throws in that 8:30, due to the free throws he recieved being out of desperation and the Mavs hacking to be able to get another shot off. So a total of 0 shooting fouls were called for Wade in the 4th.
___

Game 4:
98-74 win for the Heat. Mavs shot 31% and Wade had 9 free throws. Nothing to talk about really. Mavs completely outplayed.
___
Game 5:
This is the game where Wade goes onto shoot as many free throws as the entire Dallas team. 21-25 went Wade and 21-25 went Dallas. Game went into overtime as well.
Wade had 22 points going into the 4th quarter. Wade scored 17 in the 4th quarter with the last 6 points all coming from jumpers. Even the game tying shot was a jumper to level the game at 93-93 with 2 seconds left. No free throws needed. 7 of Wade's 17 points came from FT's. So he basically maintained his average foul shot per quarter rate in the 4th.

Then in the overtime, the score was 100-99 in favor of the Mavs with 2 seconds left and Wade was given 2 free throws. As many of you know, at the time there was great debate as to whether this was a foul or not. The play involved Harris and Nowitzki both hacking Wade and Nowitzki being called for the foul.

http://imgur.com/E1DQBuo

That was the play for those who have forgot. Many people say this wasn't a foul. Now take a look at what happened on this play:

http://imgur.com/NKVuJ3u

Harris' leg clearly fouling Wade.

Also:
Dirk giving Wade a huge shove, just look at the amount of contact.

http://imgur.com/71sl2Vf

Not to mention Harris grabbed Wade's other hand on the way to the basket. He didn't just slap it, but grabbed it and didn't allow Wade to have shooting motion. That is a foul even in late game situations. Two players hacking and getting a huge amount of contact. On his leg, one arm and pushing on his back. That has to get called even in the dying seconds. 

http://imgur.com/2gs1nV3



Harris' grabbing Wade's shooting arm, pretty much not allowing a shot to be attempted.
___
Game 6:
Heat win the championship with a 95-92 win.


**Interesting facts**:

With this all summed up, there are certain other facts.
In this playoff run, Dirk Nowitzki sets a record for must FT's hit during the playoffs shooting 209-229. Wade on the other hand shoots 202-250 with both players playing 23 games in the playoffs that year. For a player who is more of a slasher, Wade only managed to get 21 more free throws? So I guess it really is rigged, right?  

Furthermore, Wade shot 10 and 14 free throws in the first two games, so its not like he just got more free throws the next few games. He was already getting to the line a lot.

The total foul count in the series was 146 fouls commited by the Miami Heat and 160 fouls commited by the Mavericks. Fairly equal if anything. Furthermore, it's amazing it was soo close considering the Heat have Shaq and Wade on their team. Wade is a driver who gets a lot of free throws anyway, and Shaq is a guy who teams love to send to the line. Also, the Mavericks were more of a jumpshooting teams, with most of their driving coming from Harris and Howard.

**Quick facts**:


Miami outrebounded the Mavs in 4 of the 6 games in the series.
In the 4 games Miami won, they shot better in 3 of those matchups, with the only time they shot worse being by .8 of a %.
Miami shot less threes then the Dallas team in 5 of the 6 games. The one time they shot more threes then the Dallas team, they lost.


So just for you doubters, hopefully you come through and realize that the NBA is not out to make one team win and one team lose.

706,"What LeBron James gets wrong (about the NFL's slave mentality, and about crowning himself as the GOAT)",12,abjduo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/abjduo/what_lebron_james_gets_wrong_about_the_nfls_slave/,48,1546388611,"Ever since moving to Los Angeles full time, LeBron James has been making headlines for his stellar play and some questionable comments. Let's ignore the rap lyrics (because even as a Jewish person, I couldn't care less) and focus on the more substantive debates.
 
**The NFL owners have a ""slave mentality""**
 
The comments: *""In the NFL they got a bunch of old white men owning teams, and they got that slave mentality.' And it's like, 'This is my team. You do what the fuck I tell y'all to do or we get rid of y'all.' ""*

I don’t like using the slavery comparison because it betrays the gravity of those moral crimes, but there’s definitely some truth to this if you take that as exaggeration for emphasis. NFL players have FAR less power than NBA players. They're treated worse. They don't have full guaranteed contracts. In contrast, NBA players are treated like kings.
 
But what LeBron James either misses or excludes here is the reason *why.*
 
He implies (not directly said) that one reason for this disparity is the leadership of the two leagues -- both in the commissioner's office, and among the player union and leadership. As he explains:
 
*""[Adam Silver] doesn't mind us having... a real feeling and to be able to express that. It doesn't even matter if Adam agrees with what we are saying, he at least wants to hear us out.""*
 
Again, the implication here is that the difference in treatment is partly due to a difference in mentality and leadership. LeBron James has always been a champion of player empowerment, and he deserves credit for that. Under his leadership (formal or informal), NBA players have taken a much more active role in the direction of their teams and their careers.
 
However, there's a fundamental difference between NBA players and NFL players. Simply put, **NBA players matter more.**
 
Part of this is simple math. An NBA player is 1/5 of the starting lineup. An NFL player is 1/22 (if you include offense and defense.) By that basis alone, the NBA player has a more serious impact on the game result. An NFL quarterback is arguably even more important, but that's a single position. A great NBA player can have a phenomenal impact from any position on the court, largely because they can control the flow on offense and will still play a role on defense as well.
 
Do you know what athlete is the *most* empowered? Floyd Mayweather Jr. Because, after all, he’s 1 of 1. Mayweather can make $100M+ dollars for a fight. Even beyond that (because the pay-per-view aspect skews the money), he can control the event, the time, the venue, the preliminary matches, etc, down to every last detail. He doesn’t need a full league or a tournament - he needs one other guy to beat. He effectively produces the show himself. There may have been a time when superstar boxers like Mike Tyson got taken advantage of, but Mayweather realizes his value and the power and influence he can yield. As you expand the numbers in team sports, you naturally get less and less impactful on the results of the match. 
 
In a sport with 22 starters and 52 man rosters, the impact and power dynamics are entirely different. The NFL realizes that none of their players (save quarterbacks) matter much at all. That can be good or bad. It's good in the sense that the Kansas City Chiefs can cut a bad egg like Kareem Hunt: knowing full well that they can replace him easily. Arguably, it's bad because they can ostracize players like Colin Kaepernick. If you're not a stud QB, you don't matter much.
 
The other reason that NBA players have more power than NFL players is the **injury factor** (and shelf-life factor.) An NFL player who's great at 24 years old may very well be over the hill by age 28. That's far less true of the NBA. There may be injuries here and there, but we can generally expect someone like Giannis Antetokounmpo to be a good player for the next 3-4 years at least.
 
In the NFL, the specter of injuries looms much larger and affects far more players. The reason their contracts are not fully guaranteed is for this specific reason. They can't predict who's going to be healthy next year, and thus can't commit a bunch of their cap space in the process. If they did (and had to guarantee a contract for the life of the deal), they may not have enough healthy bodies to fill out a roster.
 
The fact that the NFL/NCAA requires football players to stay on campus for 3 full seasons also exacerbates that concern. A lot of players *enter* the NFL with wear and tear on their bodies. In the NBA, teams love young players on rookie deals because they know they'll be affordable -- and will rocket up in price afterwards. In the NFL, teams love young players on rookie deals because they know that their career may be *finished* by the time the deal ends.
 
Another huge factor is the degree of **coaching involvement.** In the NBA, coaches do call some plays and run some systems, but not nearly to the level that NFL coaches do. NFL coordinators are calling 100% of the plays on the field (and coordinators calling defenses against those plays.) The Xs-and-Os is a giant chess match, of which the coaches/coordinators play a huge role. We can see recently how young quarterbacks like Jared Goff, or Mitchell Trubisky, or even Patrick Mahomes have thrived thanks in part to bright offensive coaches.
 
The importance of NFL coaching and offensive/defensive system also contributes to a feeling that players matter less (than NBA players.) Partly as a result of that (and other factors we mentioned), NFL free agency is not nearly as important as NBA free agency. NFL teams can't be sure if a certain player will succeed in their particular system and for their particular coach. Nnamdi Asomugha was the world's top cornerback in Oakland, only to underwhelm in Philadelphia's system. We don't hear nearly as much concern like that in the NBA. Perhaps the closest was some murmurs that Kawhi Leonard may be worse outside of Gregg Popovich's system in San Antonio but -- as it turns out -- it didn't matter much at all.
 
Certainly, coaching matters in the NBA to some degree, but it matters *less.* And as a result, it reinforces the point that NBA players matter *more.* Conversely, NFL coaching matters more -- so players matter less. Tom Brady may be the greatest QB of all-time, but he arguably matters less than his own coach. You would never think that in the NBA.
 
Given that, it's easier to understand the power dynamics of the sports. In the NFL, coaches can loom over players, while the opposite is true in the NBA. As a result, NBA franchises need to do everything in their power to keep their stars happy, or go out of their way to sweet talk and recruit new ones into the fold. They kowtow to players -- not out of kindness or liberal leanings, but out of necessity. That deference flows through to the unions and CBAs as well.
 
Again, there's some truth to what LeBron James is saying. NFL owners are indeed older, more white, and more politically conservative (with wealth more often inherited). And, NFL players are indeed treated worse than NBA players. But those two are not inherently linked. 
 
Simply, NFL players are treated worse because they matter less. That's not a mentality; that's a reality.
 
**The greatest of all time**

The comments: *I was super, super ecstatic to win one for Cleveland because of the 52-year [championship] drought. And then after I stopped, I was like, that one right there made you the greatest player of all time.*
 
First of all, I hate judging a current player against a retired one, because we're only partly through the process. That'd be like me watching *A Star is Born* and then standing and screaming ""This is the best movie of the year!"" in the middle of the second act. Relax. We have plenty of time for those discussions later on.
 
When the dust is settled on LeBron James' career, he may very well be the greatest basketball player of all time. But to me, his greatest argument is his consistency and **longevity.** James averaged 27-7-7 by Year 2, and may very well be doing the same through Year 22. *That's* his best path to being the GOAT. The guy is a basketball machine – which stands in contrast to Michael Jordan who did take some time off (on an earnest baseball journey or on a secret suspension, depending on how much of a conspiracy theorist you are.) James didn't skip a beat. He kept playing, over and over and over, and ruled his sport over and over and over. That's a legitimate argument in his favor.
 
What James (and James defenders) should not fall into is a: ""ringgzzz"" argument. Nor should they. As mentioned in the section above, a basketball player can have an enormous impact on a game (compared to a football player.) That said, they're not boxers. They're not playing 1 on 1. They're playing 5 on 5. And those variables add more complexity to the argument than the simple:
""rings = greatness"" argument.

But rather than acknowledge the silliness there, James decided to embrace the ring narrative and simply move the goal posts to suggest that his title should be worth double (or triple? Or 4x?). Personally, I'd take issue with the idea that James' ring in Cleveland is fundamentally different than all championships in the past. The city of Cleveland had a long title drought (ignoring *Major League*), but MOST cities don't win championships. MOST franchises do not have a storied history of success. In a league with 30 teams, not everyone gets a trophy at the end of the year. Losing is the norm.
 
And that losing reputation can often change in a hurry. The New England Patriots didn't have much success as a franchise before Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. The Chicago Bulls didn't have much success before Michael Jordan. Golden State fans were booing their owner a few years before they became a dynasty. You're only a rotten franchise -- until you aren't.
 
I can see an argument that LeBron James' title in Cleveland should be given heavy bonus points if he built it organically. If he turned around a team on the bottom and lifted it to the title slowly but surely until they got over the hump (a la Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas, or alternate dimension Kevin Durant in OKC.)
 
But we have to remember what actually happened. LeBron James left Cleveland, and only returned when they won the NBA Draft lottery and the # 1 pick -- not once, not twice, but three times. As a result, they managed to have a roster with Kyrie Irving and picks that would translate into Kevin Love. We're talking about two All-Star caliber players who were both in their primes.
 
With Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love, and LeBron James, the deck was not stacked against the Cleveland Cavaliers. They were, by far, the favorite to come out of the Eastern Conference. Their team was title worthy, and would have won 2-3 championships if a Golden State super team didn't emerge out of nowhere.
 
To be fair, LeBron James' comments were not only about the drought, but also about that opponent. As he mentioned:
 
*""Everybody was just talking -- how [the Warriors] were the greatest team of all time, like it was the greatest team ever assembled. And for us to come back, you know, the way we came back in that fashion, I was like, ‘you did something special.*
 
Absolutely, I agree with James there. To beat a 73-win team was incredible, especially in the manner that they did it.
 
That said, I'd take a slight issue here. **Regular season win totals do not automatically equate to your greatness as a team.** We've seen time and time again (especially lately), that the playoffs are an entirely different animal. If season wins and point differential were the be-all and end-all, the Toronto Raptors would have multiple Finals appearances by now.
 
As the Kyle Lowry-DeMar DeRozan Raptors proved, some teams are better in the regular season, and some are better in the playoffs. LeBron James' teams (thanks to him) have routinely been better in the playoffs than the regular season.
 
The point here is that: *that* Warriors team (with Harrison Barnes) was not the greatest team ever assembled, nor playing that way in big games. They had previously won the title, but did that against an injury-riddled Cleveland team (that they still only beat 4-2.) They barely squeaked by Oklahoma City 4-3 to make the Finals. For whatever reason, those Golden State teams were better in the regular season than the playoffs. They were not an unstoppable force at all. The Cavs winning that series was an upset, but not wholly different than the times LeBron James got upset himself.
 
Meanwhile, the new Warriors are indeed a juggernaut. The Kevin Durant + Warriors teams had worse regular season records than the pre-KD Warriors, but have a higher ceiling and thus a more unbeatable aura when they turn on the gas in the playoffs. They have won 8 playoff series, and lost a total of 6 games while doing so (going 32-6.) They cut their playoff losses by more than half. If LeBron James' team had beaten *this* version of the Golden State Warriors, I'd acknowledge that it may be the straw that broke the camel's back in regards to the GOAT debate. But to me, the victory over the 73-win Golden State Warriors was -- while hugely impressively – does not lead James to surpass Michael Jordan.

It may happen one day. But not today. And not because of one title in Cleveland. He will need to keep that power button on and keep that motor running, because he still has more work to do.
 
**greatness but not beyond reproach**
 
I understand that someone who just wrote 1000+ words criticizing LeBron James may classify as a ""hater,"" but that's not my intention. I'm not a die-hard fan of any particular team or any particular player (hence the lack of flair.)
 
In fact, I happen to be a huge admirer of LeBron James as a human being. He handles his business (literally, his business) in exceptional fashion. He appears to be a great husband and father. He's a willing and engaged advocate for social and political change. He's doing all the right things. His heart is in the right place.
 
That said, that doesn't make him beyond criticism. I firmly believe that you can criticize your friends, your family members, or your favorite players when you happen to disagree with them. And in these two particular instances, I happen to disagree with James.",0.53,controversial,1/1/19 16:23

I've seen countless comments saying only he could have dragged them to the finals, Kd/curry would have lost in the 1st round against Indiana, etc. 

To me that's ridiculous. So you complain GSW ruined the league by being too stacked with 2 MVPs and 2 other stars, but then say those same MVPs would not be able to get past a Victor Oladipo-led team (who had multiple bad games in that series) or a Tatum/Horford led team? If lesser players such as Iverson, Kidd, and Dwight all were able to carry weak supporting casts out of the East, do you really think Curry or Kd couldn't? 

Toronto wouldn't be much of a problem seeing as how they always fold. Boston would be tough, but I don't understand why the same people who say the 2015 finals doesn't count because Kyrie and Love were injured, are saying winning the ECF is so legendary and impressive when Boston was also missing Kyrie and Hayward.

And honestly after seeing Harden carry a team of G-leaguers from 14th to 3rd seed, I think he could too. Yes he folded against the spurs in 17 and was not perfect in the 18 WCF but the spurs and warriors were both lightyears ahead of Indiana/Toronto/Boston in terms of talent, coaching and defensive schemes, which helped stifle him a bit.

Downvote me if you want, but I really think the claim that ""Lebron is the best because only he can carry bad teams to the finals"" is not true. I truly believe Kd or curry in place of Lebron on the cavs would have made the finals in 2018. Harden might not be as likely but still has an excellent chance, no way I see these 3 losing against Indiana or Toronto.",0.53,controversial,3/4/19 15:37

Yesterday a video was posted that garnered a lot of attention; I will withhold the users name out of respect but he claimed that, the move that Harden did against Andrew Wiggins, which he termed was ""a blatant travel becoming Harden's signature move"". So, naturally, I made me reply in defense of the move - which then wasn't received so nicely at the time.

&nbsp;

I understand what people might have been feeling, it's a playoff game - refs have been the bane of a few viewers, or - they just hate the fact that ""James Harden always travels and gets away with it"". Listen, I understand the frustration and it's all reasonable in one way or another.

&nbsp;

I want to note that, 1. I am **NOT** a Houston Rockets fan - nor am I **FAN** of James Harden. I like guy, he's good, but, for me, I'm a fan of the sport more-so than a team or a player. So hopefully, by you all taking some time to digest the following explanation - it will better help you understand Harden's dribble mechanic and his excellent use of footwork.

> A pivot takes place when a player, who is holding the ball, steps once or more than once in any direction with the same foot, with the other foot (pivot foot) in contact with the floor.

> If the player wishes to dribble after a pivot, the ball must be out of his hand before the pivot foot is raised off the floor. If the player raises his pivot off the floor, he must pass or attempt a field goal before the foot is returned to the floor.

> If he fails to follow these guidelines, he has committed a traveling violation.

&nbsp;

**Section XIII pg. 37: Traveling**

> B. A player who comes to a stop on step one when both feet are on the floor or touch the floor simultaneously may pivot using either foot as his pivot. If he jumps with both feet he must release the ball before either foot touches the floor.

> H. Upon ending his dribble or gaining control of the ball, a player may not touch floor consecutively with the same foot (hop).


&nbsp;

There are about 15 separate rules that explain different types of ""travels""; that is not taking into consideration the plethora of rules that distinguish what dribbles are as well as other rules that may in-fact offset already set and established rules– I mean, it’s insane. I have a whole new perspective and respect for referees after just SKIMMING the rule book. Anyways, in this case, these two rules mentioned above are crucial and reflect the James Harden play, and if misunderstood incorrectly - would deem his move a travel.

&nbsp;

Also, shootout to /u/abumaju – I had to google the definition for “gather step”; not that I didn’t know what it was, but I couldn’t find it in the rule book – and he had a post from 2013 that explained why 3 steps were deemed “legal”.

&nbsp;

**Gather Step** - [You're allowed 2 steps upon completion of a dribble, so if you dribble while pushing off of one foot it is not counted toward one of your 2 allowed steps.]( https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1lyyr3/explanation_of_why_3_steps_is_actually_legal/)

&nbsp;

Alright, now that we have rules out of the way – lets discuss replays.

&nbsp;

This is a topic that’s very prevalent within the NFL – especially after BIG HITS. In the NFL, when you slow down a play it looks WAY more vicious than it does when actually watching it. This is a concern that I have with NFL fans calling every other slow-motion tackle a “dirty hit”. The game of football is fast paced, so when an action occurs it may or may not seem that big until you slow it down.

&nbsp;

THIS, however, is the opposite in basketball.

&nbsp;

Basketball is a fast-paced sport, and you have to take into account many different things, I mean, just look at the damn NBA Rulebook – would I want to be a ref after reading that thing? HELL NO!

&nbsp;

When you watch a play in live action, as opposed to football, the move may look illegal, because you can’t see everything that’s going on. Basketball players are so quick with their footwork that every other Harden euro-step, or Lebron James drive to the rim is called a foul. However, when you slow it down, it is THEN when you break down the play that you see what **actually** happened.

&nbsp;

Now, all of that aside, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of this ordeal.

&nbsp;

[This was the video that everyone was up in arms about – and, rightfully so.]( https://streamable.com/ikkia)

&nbsp;

/u/sims888 – hands down one of the best memers and contributors on the subreddit [sent me this picture asking if it was a gather step.]( https://imgur.com/40k2l8j)

&nbsp;

When woke up to that message and saw that picture, I was like “woah, okay, that looks really bad”, not because it was a genuine question. But because it appears Harden has both feet on the ground – and then he would have to take a few more steps to get behind the 3 point line to shoot the ball. Which, to anyone who would see that pic – would call his play a travel.

&nbsp;

**BREAKING DOWN THE PLAY**:

[James Harden activating the crossover on Andrew Wiggins]( https://imgur.com/hYK12ZR)
* Here we see Harden attempting what appears to be a crossover. His body is leaned forward, right leg extended and holding his position, while his left leg is jabbing towards the ground.

&nbsp;

[James Harden closing in]( https://imgur.com/qLUvxfp)
* What we see here, is Harden dribbling the ball, legally closing the distance – bringing his body closer together and placing tons of bodyweight on his left leg.

&nbsp;

* Harden, still in the act of dribbling, sizes up Wiggins – slowly starting to use the energy he placed on his left leg with his body weight in the picture above.

&nbsp;

[Harden 7: Note: these movements are happening within SECONDS](https://imgur.com/aj8FKMM)

&nbsp;

Okay, so what is Harden doing here? He is using the force that he placed on his left leg and is now proceeding to take Wiggins off balance and create distance between the two.
[Within ONE SECOND Harden has a victim. Wiggins is off balance, he has no way to recover, so Harden is now beginning to release his left leg – to create distance](https://imgur.com/AeYevIQ)

&nbsp;

Okay, here is where we take a moment and admire Harden’s agile footwork, the whole play was derived from placing weight on that left leg – however, if you’re into boxing, you would know that your “jab leg” in this case is ALWAYS supported by the leg that is behind it; THAT is where your power comes from – and in this case, is what Harden used to not only create an impressive amount of distance – but do so – so quickly and fluidly that his left leg APPEARED to be on the ground but was only INCHES away from touching it. If this man was a boxer – he would be something else based off his ability to move so effortlessly on the court.

&nbsp;

Harden now utilizes this and quickly bounces off his left leg, transferring moment and force and then…

&nbsp;

[Bam, both legs hit the ground and we all know what happens next](https://imgur.com/kYrGqhU)

&nbsp;

To conclude, Harden has amazing footwork, his awkward movements are his ace card – defenders don’t know how to guard it – which is why I’m sure people consider him one of the most ungaurdable players in the NBA today.

&nbsp;

I have to say, after breaking this down, I give so much respect to referees, because if it was any average joe nba fan officiating this game – they would have called this move a travel. 

&nbsp;

I can’t speak on other plays, because it took me so long to break down this one – but the guy moves in seconds, he knows the rules, all he is doing is exploiting defenders with his timing to create space for his shot. Hopefully this helped you understand the type of player Harden is; and to know that – not everything is as it seems; which is why breaking down film is extremely crucial in understanding a player and his movements. 

&nbsp;

Alas, I am not trying to convince anyone of anything, but help them realize what happened last night, and that the uproar for this move, justifiably so – to those that just saw it for what it was – was okay, but they were misguided by their eyes.

&nbsp;

I really wanted to make this a video but, oh well.. lol.. hope you guys enjoyed this, take care – for now. 😊

&nbsp;

Peace!

&nbsp;


Anything other than his other foot moving behind the arch for the plant after his SECOND STEP BEHIND THE ARCH would be deemed a travel, him planting his OTHER foot behind the arch to then go for the jumper IS NOT A STEP.

709,Durant joining the Warriors would be the most Anti-Competitive thing I've ever seen. He and the team would instantly be hated for it.,0,4r5cao,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4r5cao/durant_joining_the_warriors_would_be_the_most/,132,1467632027,"You might have seen [this Durant tweet from 2010](https://twitter.com/kdtrey5/status/18688294600) in which Durant says:

>Now everybody wanna play for the heat and the Lakers? Let's go back to being competitive and going at these peoples!

Frankly, if Durant joins the Warriors it's 10x more anti-competitive than what LeBron did in 2010.   In 2010, the Heat were a 47 win team.  They gutted the roster to make room for LeBron and Bosh.  

Look, I know Michael Beasley didn't go on to much success, but at the time Beasley was a 21 year old who had been recently selected 2nd in the draft and had just come off a season averaging 14.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.3 assist.  The Heat flat out gave him away for a 2nd rounder just to make cap space to sign LeBron and Bosh.  

Consider the teams also ""in the running"" to land Durant this season.  The Boston Celtics are a 48 win team that theoretically could add Al Horford and Kevin Durant without sacrificing any significant pieces.  That's the equivalent of what LeBron did in Miami - joined a 47 win team with another all-star.  His method of doing it was undoubtedly annoying and classless, but what he actually did still had some semblance of competitive spirit.  

On the flip side, Durant joining Golden State this Summer would be one of the most disgraceful things I've ever seen in competitive sports.  They came inches away from being back-to-back champions.  They arguably had the greatest offense we've ever seen.  They are coming off a record-breaking 73 win regular season and came mere seconds away from having a legitimate claim as the greatest team of all-time.  Game 7 was fucking tied with a minute left.  The game was essentially decided by a single FG.

Durant joining a world-beating 73 win team would be the ultimate spineless move.  Steph, Draymond and Clay are all in their 20s and all three of them were All-NBA players this years.  Not to mention, this is the team that just defeated Durant in the playoffs. 

Do not dare compare this to what LeBron did in Miami.  It's not even remotely close.  This would be like if in 2008 after narrowly losing to KG/Pierce/Ray's 66 win Celtics in game 7, LeBron decided to sign with them in the offseason - but only if the aging KG, Pierce and Ray had all been in their mid 20s, in the thick of their prime and a 73 win record-setting team.  

Also, in terms of his legacy, I don't see how this will really benefit him.  Steph is the reigning MVP of the entire league.  Any championships they win will just be adding to Steph's resume.  Wade was a step past his prime by the time LeBron showed up - it was pretty clear LeBron was the main guy there immediately.   That's unlikely to be the case on Golden State.  Really, the only place that team has to go is down.  They are unlikely to win more than 73 games next season even with Durant.  Even if they win the championship, how much credit can Durant really get for it?  

In order for Durant to get credit, Steph and Klay would need to suddenly evolve into side-kicks, Durant would need to lead the team in multiple statistical categories, they'd need to win 80 regular season games and sweep through the playoffs - with Durant winning Finals MVP in the process.  Anything less than that?  He's an anti-competitive bandwagoner.   

I live in Seattle and saw Durant's first home game in person.  I've been rooting for him for a long time.  If he joins the Warriors, I'll lose a lot of respect for him.  Meanwhile, Golden State has been an exceptionally likeable team for two seasons.  I've been rooting for Steph Curry since he was a rookie.  I have an affinity for shooters.  I use to argue with fans about how Monta Ellis was holding back Curry and the kid could be a superstar.   I love that guy...   If Durant joins that team, the Warriors instantly become the league-wide villains.  They become the ""evil empire"".  They become a negative symbol for everyone outside of Golden State.   I can't be alone in this.  Many would see Durant as an anti-competitive puss.   

The irony is that this is possibly the one scenario that could turn previously-despised LeBron James in to an underdog hero.  I can't imagine rooting for that bushleague Golden State team if they clashed with 32 year old LeBron in the Finals.   If LeBron succeeded in defeating them - the act alone would make him arguably the greatest athlete in history.   THAT is how you build a legacy.  

**TL;DR:  Durant joining Golden State would make him the biggest anti-competitive bitch in history.  Fan opinion would instantly turn against both him and that team.  It would be terrible for his legacy.  If they stayed on top, he'd get little credit for it.  If all he cares about is helping another star collect jewelry, he might as well take the league minimum and go help LeBron win another championship**",0.45,controversial,7/4/16 4:33
710,The Suns will not be the worst team in the West,0,caz0ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/caz0ho/the_suns_will_not_be_the_worst_team_in_the_west/,84,1562696341,"Bookmark this now.

&#x200B;

Three years ago the organization decided to embrace the tank and commit to fully rebuilding and building through the draft to accumulate the talent for the next great Suns team.

We on purpose put together extremely young teams with the intention to give young players a chance to develop with playing time while also guaranteeing a high draft pick. The last 2 years r/nba fans and casual Suns fans cried about acquiring any PG but the Suns resisted doing something stupid like trading first round picks for Terry Rozier or making other short-term moves to adress glaring issues.

&#x200B;

**We played the whole season last year without a PG.** 

Canaan was a D-League scrub who brought positive attitude and played hard but has no idea how to run an offense and by metrics was one of the worst players in the league.

Melton flashed defensive potential occasionally but he is 2nd round project that had no idea how to play offense and overall was not good on defense at all. At one point later in the season Booker was so frustrated with Melton that he yelled at Igor during the game to ""put his ass on the bench"".

Okobo also only showed flashes but was far away from being even a serviceable backup.

&#x200B;

**We played the whole last year without a PF.**

Ariza was slacking. Bender got a whole lot of minutes at PF without ever earning them and consistently being one of the worst 10 players in the league since being drafted. So we often played small forwards at PF that were nowhere near ready to hold their own against power forwards.

&#x200B;

**We kept playing ""low floor - high potential"" scrubs major minutes hoping for it to click since we had nothing to lose.**

We kept giving major minutes to Josh Jackson hoping it would finally click for him despite him being one of the worst 10 players in the league and he gave us nothing but occasional flashes. His boneheaded decision making cost us several possessions per game just by himself. Anyone who follows the NBA knows how killer it is to have two completely unnecessary turnovers, charges or running into low percentage layups or getting blocked.

Josh Jackson got his layups blocked at least once per game.

Many people always described him as a defender, but he was absolutely awful at actually playing defense and consistently lost his man.

One of the biggest flaw is that players like Josh Jackson played like they were trying to be the next Tracy McGrady but the Suns do not even have room for that. We already have our star players in Ayton and Booker. We can't afford a 20 year old out there trying to go from scrub to star. We needed players who accept their role as role players first of all and do that job first.

&#x200B;

**We had a coach whose system was completely opposed to the strength of the players he was working with.**

Igor was a horrendous coach. Even though he initially claimed to build a system around his players he had set targets for assists and 3pt attempts per game. Despite the Suns being the worst 3pt shooting teams in the NBA he had us shooting a high volume of 3s.

Despite not having a PG he tried to play fast. A young team like that playing fast without a PG is a recipe for disaster when you have players like Jackson who totally kill many possessions. If you run up the total possessions per game the difference between the mistakes a young team makes compared to more veteran solid teams just grows larger and makes it more likely to lose.

&#x200B;

**Losing TJ Warren is unlikely to have much of an effect.**

He was a constant in our worst performing 5-man units. He didn't fit in at all. He does not move the ball. While he is a good slasher off the ball it still never felt like he actually moves off the ball. He miraculously raised his 3pt% but it was still on a low volume and he still never looked like a natural shooter.

He struggled on defense. He was hopeless in playing the 4 defensively.

He constantly injured himself with concussions or other undisclosed mystery injuries.

I can't recount how often he made myself pull my hair out when he committed charging fouls or took low percentage shots when he had an obvious open pass to make.

538 rated him as a scrub. While I personally don't believe that I think his skillset fills a niche that simply was not there on the Suns. We need 3&D players to surround Booker, Ayton and now Rubio. If we kept Warren he was going to get stuck behind Bridges and Oubre.

&#x200B;

**This offseason things have been different.**

&#x200B;

**Addition by Substraction**

James Jones cut away all the negative players. Jackson, Melton and Bender are gone 

&#x200B;

**The Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs way**

We brought in a lot of young vets that are maybe not sexy but solid players who can be expected to play hard and do their job.

In the draft James Jones went for 2 players who are expected to be more mature and have well-defined NBA skillsets instead of swinging for the fences with another low floor high ceiling 19 year old who is struggling to find his way. Also he constructed the roster in a way that rookies are not going to be counted on to be rotation players from the start.

Every year you look at the Spurs and Heat roster and you think wow that is a collection of some uninspiring players but most of the time even if you think they have little talent on the roster they end up playing hard and solid and beat teams that seemingly have talent but are inconsistent, immature or whatever.

&#x200B;

**Positional Upgrades and closing gaping holes in the roster**

We upgraded from Richaun Holmes to Aron Baynes. Holmes was nice surprise for the Suns but struggled on the boards and defensively. Baynes is expected to bring more toughness, defense and mentality to the team.

I am not a fan of Saric or Kaminsky but it certainly is a huge upgrade over playing Dragan Bender at the 4 and having nobody else. 

&#x200B;

**Carrying over the attitude shift**

Tyler Johnson and Kelly Oubre made an impact last season already. When everyone was healthy we actually saw improvements already. Tyler Johnson is a solid player, solid defender who plays hard. Kelly Oubre brought a lot to the team as well in terms of mentality and attitude and playing hard.

&#x200B;

**The Young Core - Improvements from Within**

Mikal Bridges had a great rookie season that nobody is talking about. He was as a rookie rated one of the absolute best perimeter defenders in the entire league already.

Booker has gotten better every year in the league. Last year he came into the season with a hand injury and turf toe. Toward the end of the year he was noticeably more explosive, frequently dunking which he did not do much before.

Ayton had a great rookie season and actually was first in most of the advanced stats. He is due to make significant improvement.

Oubre should also be mentioned here.

&#x200B;

**To have a PG or not to have a PG**

Ricky Rubio - while I am not a huge fan of his you can't deny that he will have a huge effect on the Suns. We had no PG last year. There is plenty of precedence for huge W/L improvements that are tied to the acquisition of a PG or improvement at the PG position. Just look at the Kings last year, before the season pretty much nobody thought they had more talent than the Suns but Fox got a lot better and suddenly the Kings performed a lot better despite on paper having less talent. There are plenty examples like Steve Nash signing with the Suns, Kidd to the Nets are probably a lot more where PGs  made significant impacts. While Rubio is not of that caliber going from Canaan to Rubio is probably a more drastic difference than going from Marbury to Nash or from Marbury to Kidd.

As a result Ayton should get more consistent touches.

Booker does not have to bring up the ball all the time and play against elite ball pressure all the time. Last year teams often double teamed him as soon as he crossed half court, some pressured him all the way which sometimes frustrated him and exhausted him.

Hopefully Rubio's passing is contagious. Ayton already showed elite passing ability for a center. Saric is as good a passer as almost any PF. Booker is a good passer. Bridges showed glimpses of passing ability. Hopefully Oubre can develop that part of his game.

&#x200B;

**Potential for Trade Deadline Moves**

This year it is likely that James Jones could commit if a really good player becomes available. The Suns have a huge expiring contract in Tyler Johnson and all their future first round picks to further upgrade the roster if they are somewhat close to the 8th seed.

&#x200B;

**Lineups on Paper**

If you rank the NBA starting lineups by WAR(Wins Above Replacement) the new Suns starting lineup actually ranks 17th in the entire league and that stat probably underestimates them still since they have been on bad or even bad dysfunctional teams.

&#x200B;

Ayton / Baynes

Saric / Kaminsky

Oubre / Bridges / Cam Johnson

Booker / Tyler Johnson / Cam Johnson

Rubio / Carter / Ty Jerome 

&#x200B;

We probably won't run a 10 man rotation. Kaminsky will see minutes at the 4 and 5. Bridges will get minutes at the 2 and 3. Oubre will get minutes at the 3 and 4. Booker will get minutes at the 2 and 1. Tyler Johnson is going to get minutes at the 2 and 1.

Ayton might even see some minutes as the 4 as he played very well against Giannis and Lebron when he was matched up against them defensively all game. In fact if Ayton and Kaminsky share the floor my expectation would be that Ayton covers the 4 and Kaminsky the 5.

&#x200B;

**Important to start off on the right foot and create momentum**

Can they click from the start? This would be important to create excitement in a sleeping fan base.

Chemistry with each other and with the coachin staff could determine their season.

&#x200B;

**The competition**

Everyone talks about how tough the West is but the bottom line is that all Western teams have to play basically the same schedule.

Memphis looks like it will be in the situation that the Suns were the last 3 years where they fully commit to the rebuild and will be playing guys like Josh Jackson. Same could happen in Oklahoma.

The Mavs have a similiar makeup as the Suns with their duo and some solid pieces around them. But I don't think you can look at their roster on paper and think they have a better roster.

The Pelicans are young and will be relying on young players a lot.

The Timberwolves don't look too hot after losing several rotation players in Derrick Rose, Saric and potentially Jones.

The Spurs are probably going to be very solid but they are not a lock like Golden State, Houston, LAC, Portland, Utah, Denver and the Lakers. 

The Spurs are the favorites for the 8th seed but any of the rest of the field except Memphis could have a breakout year and take it from them.

&#x200B;

Tier 1: Golden State, LA Clippers, Houston

Tier 2: Portland, Denver, Lakers, Utah

Tier 3: San Antonio

Tier 4: Phoenix, Dallas, New Orleans, Sacramento, Minnesota, OKC

Tier 5: Memphis

&#x200B;

**Some teams are bound to fall below expectations**

It is possible that Utah never gels with the changes they made. The players they brought in (Conley and Bojan) take a lot more shots than the players they let go (Rubio and Favors). Conley and Mitchell would join a long list of high usage backcourts that never worked out.

It is possible that the Lakers have a similar season to last year.

The Kings might find it hard to sustain their improvement from last year.

Minnesota might fall apart completely.

New Orleans looks like a wild card - why? They rely a lot on young players, a lot of young players who came into the league expecting to be star players. I predict struggles for them getting these guys to gel and buy into their roles.",0.5,controversial,7/9/19 11:19
711,If the Lakers aren't careful they're going to turn into another pre-ASB 2018 Cavs situation,4,c9y3rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c9y3rp/if_the_lakers_arent_careful_theyre_going_to_turn/,50,1562473009,"In 2018 the Cavs started the season with Rose, Wade, LeBron, and Crowder sharing the court together and Kevin Love starting at center. These weren't awful players per se, several of them found success after moving on from the Cavs, but their team had no vision and their skillsets made 0 sense together. They had no clearly defined strengths and started the year as one of the worst offensive and defensive teams in the league. They tried experimenting with lineups (even testing out third stringers like Jose Calderon and Channing Frye) for a few months but eventually decided the damage was already done, gave up, and shipped everyone out at the all star break in a last ditch effort to save the season.

I feel like we're starting to see a similar pattern with the Lakers' last couple signings. I liked the Cook and Green signings but Rondo is fools gold. He still appears to be a good player but every year since he left the Celtics he's been a net negative on the floor. You can't have a ball dominant point guard that plays no defense and ruins spacing. Starting him with LeBron and Cousins is a potentially disastrous combination and I'm genuinely afraid that Rondo will get the nod over Cook/Caruso because of ""experience"" and name recognition. We already know how bad of a fit he is with LeBron. For reference:

LeBron + Caruso lineups: +9.1 in 147 minutes

LeBron + Rondo lineups: -5.4 in 602 minutes

Then there's Cousins. Now unlike Rondo I don't think Cousins is a terrible player but I do think he's going to severely limit the potential of an AD + LeBron combo assuming he starts. What the Lakers should be doing is starting AD at the 5 and centering their offense around the LeBron/Davis PnR. Simply surrounding them with shooting at every position and one more versatile wing defender would result in a devastating offensive team and a pretty solid defensive one. Starting Cousins could screw that all up. He still has a place on the team but it would be best to keep him out of the starting lineup in favor of more shooting. You can't expect for Danny Green to uphold the spacing on his own.

Now with all this said, based on sheer talent alone there's almost no chance that they'll be as bad as that Cavs team unless Rondo starts (I'm only half joking). I just think they're limiting the insane potential of a LeBron/AD PnR in favor of signing household names and it could cost them a championship.",0.52,controversial,7/6/19 21:16

**19.5 PTS**/**12.2 REB**/**0.9 AST**/**0.7 STL**/0.8 BLK/2.5 TOV/**3.6 PF**/**53.9 FG%**/54.8 2PT%/**20.3 3PT%**/**58.3 TS%**

##HARD ENES (playoff stats/36):

18.2 PTS/11.9 REB/0.6 AST/0.4 STL/**1.7 BLK**/**2.0 TOV**/4.8 PF/51.3 FG%/54.8 2PT%/14.3 3PT%/57.1 TS%



Using these advanced statistics, I conclude that Soft Enes is easily better than Hard Enes, being ahead in almost every meaningful statistical category. The only real advantage Hard Enes holds is accumulating over twice as many blocks, which clearly shows that Enes Kanter's platonic arousal invigorates him and his animal instincts fuel him to become a defensive menace in the paint.

**10 Highlights**

This last week Dennis Schroder shot 15-50 and did not make a single 3 pointer in 3 games. He was absolutely shut down vs John Wall. He is going to be a great player and has a shit team around him but still consistency would be nice.

Tyreke Evans has scored at least 20 points every game in November. He is the only reason the Grizzlies are fun to watch right now, and he enters the top 100 for the first time this season. On that note, Mike Conley is free falling. It sucks that I have him this low but he is not playing well at all, and shot 2-12 tonight.

Ben Simmons is the best rookie since LeBron and I would argue as a rookie he is even better.

The Pistons have 3 top 50 players right now and it is well deserved. Getting Avery Bradley has completely changed this team around and Andre Drummond has finally taken the next step (so far).

Kyle Korver basically got himself in tonight with his 4th quarter against the Knicks. Don't know if he keeps it up for the season but the Cavs sure as hell need him right now.

I had Draymond 7th last week and I'm keeping him there. Stats don't tell the whole story with him, I've watched him more and I feel comfortable keeping him there for now but that's his ceiling too.

I will release my top 25 rookies Friday night, but my top 10 right now is Simmons, Tatum, Ball, Kuzma, Markkaken, Collins, Fox, Mitchell, Smith, Brooks

Paul George has scored 79 points the last 2 games. If Westbrook can play at the MVP level he was last year then OKC can take off. 

Kyle Lowry isn't scoring as much as he did last year and has probably declined a bit but he's still a very good player that makes winning plays. 

This is probably as high as Gortat will get this year, but I think his ranking is well deserved right now. I've watched a few Wizards games and I guarantee you take him out of the lineup and things will be off right away.

Finally, thanks to the night owls like me who are up this late for reading and let me know what you think.",0.49,controversial,11/14/17 7:13
714,People Hate James Harden,0,ba5v5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/ba5v5u/people_hate_james_harden/,112,1554595833,"&#x200B;

It’s the simplest way to explain the events of the past few years. The loss to Curry in 2015 was understandable. The two players had very similar stats, but Steph had served as the offensive engine of a 67-win Warriors team that surprised everyone after a coaching change. Harden did not have the help of a stellar supporting cast led by 2 All-star teammates, the closest approximation, Dwight Howard, missed half the games to injury, but Harden managed to pull a rag-tag bunch of role players featuring Trevor Ariza, Patrick Beverley and Donatas Motiejunas to the third seed in a very competitive Western Conference by posting a statline of 27.4/5.7/7. In the end, the historic nature of 67 wins and the unknown promise of unplayed fourth quarters denied Harden an MVP despite his shouldering the larger load.

That was understandable. 

Every thing since then is less defensible.

The following season was the last of the Howard years and was defined by an extreme loss of chemistry (despite being the one time in team history that Daryl Morey did not make major rotation changes due to the WCF run… aside from the acquisition of Ty Lawson), the quick hook of McHale, the total inability of JB Bickerstaff to get buy-in from the team, and a defensive video compilation of Harden’s career lowlights. Despite the team difficulties, Harden still showed improvement in his individual stats across the board. While leading the NBA in points and minutes (through 82 games), he posted an incredible 29/6/7.5 statline that had only ever been accomplished by LeBron, MJ, and Oscar Robertson. Unfortunately, due to team turmoil, it led to a disappointing 8th seed. The failure to live up to expectations surely played a role, but the resulting snub from even 3rd String All-NBA was a major statement from voters that they just didn't care for something about James Harden. Lillard, Lowry, and Thompson were all awarded selections despite having statistically inferior seasons by huge margins.

The next season was even worse. Harden set an NBA record for points created, surpassing the totals of Tiny Archibald. Yes. He produced more points for his team in one season *THAN ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE NBA*. Yet the historic feat that everyone remembers from that season was Russell Westbrook’s assault on Wilt’s triple double record and being the first player since the Big O to average one for a season. 

Be honest, now… Did you remember (or even know) that Harden was the NBA record holder for points created? Maybe, maybe not… but the media certainly didn't help bring it to your attention. There was no tracking of it every night on Sportscenter, or graphic in the sidebar, leaving people like myself to scroll through play-by-plays every night to verify how many assists resulted in three points as opposed to two. 

It wasn’t like the record caught anyone off-guard. Harden had been comfortably ahead of pace for most of the season before a late injury-induced swoon made it an incredibly tight finish. You should have paid attention to those last few games as the questions started to arise of if he could actually pull it off as his season averages dipped significantly. It was a really exciting moment. But not a single news outlet paid it a bit of attention aside from TheDreamShake blog - the same people that revealed the early MVP voting results that year by compiling all the voters picks they could get until a large enough majority had been established to safely project the winner (much to the chagrin of the NBA, who attempted to foil it before it spoiled the crown jewel of their new post-Finals awards show).

There was no good reason for the media blackout. They just didn’t want to focus any attention on the pursuit of the record.

Oh well, no big deal. It's not like he was in the middle of an MVP race and they were fawning all over his competition. Wait... No... That’s actually *exactly* what happened. The media literally created a narrative around the significance of the triple double while ignoring **the most prolific offensive season ever**.

And that was simply the prelude to the greatest disrespect of all. Despite winning 55 games and leading his team to the third seed with great efficiency, voters gave the MVP to a guy who led his team to the *10th best record* in the NBA. A meager 6th seed in the playoff bracket. 3 spots lower (in both cases) than the previously lowest MVP finish (In 1988 by one Michael Jeffery Jordan 35/5.5/5.9) from the past 40 years of media voting. 

This complete break in voting standards was utterly unprecedented, but Westbrook’s accomplishment was deemed “historically significant” as it hadn't been done in over 50 years. If you aren't drawing the connections to this year yet, stick around and I’ll point them out.

Last year was finally Harden’s redemption, though, as he finally won the MVP that had twice eluded him. His case was inscrutable. League scoring leader leading his team through injuries to the number one seed and 65 wins with historic point differentials. There was nobody in the Association even coming close to accomplishing what he was doing. But could the sports media bring themselves to simply acknowledge his greatness and the inevitability of his victory? No. Perennial “should-have-been-a-contender” LeBron James was forced into the conversation again after having disappeared from everyone’s radar for the past few seasons. After leading his team through a turbulent year of roster mayhem to the 6th best record in the league, LeBron really had zero place in the conversation aside from ‘being owed one’ for remaining the best player in the league for the past 4 years. Yet there he was, in a supposedly tight MVP race.

Yes, the media was suggesting that 2018 should be the year to give ‘Bron his 5thMVP almost as a form of ‘lifetime achievement’ award instead of honoring Harden’s accomplishments. The narrative was pushed hard in order to create a semblance of a race and avoid an early coronation where pundits could just appreciate the season as it was unfolding. In 2016 there were no qualms with simply appreciating the greatness of what Steph was doing... but when Harden was doing similar things it was time to consider a different James for top individual honors. 

This year Harden has finally seen some appreciation. It only took setting a record of the **only 35-point, 7-assist season in history**, punctuated with the only 40-point monthly average since Wilt and the second longest streak of 30-point games for the pundits to sit up and take notice. It took the most efficient high volume scoring season (over 32 ppg) resulting in breaking MJ’s 1987 record for point per possession to get a little bit of love from some of the press. 

By any standard, Harden is doing historic things. And he has done it efficiently under a tremendous usage rate that was absolutely required of him due to a heavily injured roster. And it has led to winning results as his team is challenging for the 4th best record in the league despite sitting in second-to-last place after a lackluster first couple of months. The narrative is practically too strong to be denied when compared to the one that beat Harden just two years ago. But here we are again, watching the media try desperately to ignore the history and anoint a 24-year old Greek kid who helped an excellently coached and very healthy squad to a 60-win season through an historically weak schedule.

Don’t get me wrong, Giannis has been a remarkable and integral player in his team’s success, but his only significant advantage beyond a better team record is his DPotY-caliber defense… a criteria that has historically been given short shrift in MVP discussions. 

Harden delivered one of the best offensive seasons in history. Because his team absolutely needed him to in order to win. 

And yet still the haters abound. Scoffing at his ability to draw free throws, insulting his playing style as “boring”, “against the spirit of the game”, or even “cheating”. Harping on his much improved defense, and claiming that any number of players “could do the same thing”.

Why do people love to hate James Harden?

715,Please stop talking about Hibbert's rebounding,4,22ytcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/22ytcy/please_stop_talking_about_hibberts_rebounding/,26,1397466739,"I honestly can't take another ""Hibbert with 4 rebounds, [random tiny guard] with 6"" snarky nonsense.  Hibbert's rebounding is almost certainly a product of the system, and is definitely not a problem for his team.

Here's [table one](http://imgur.com/OAZoCP2).  I'll try to add it in text as well:

| Month   | GP    | Reb%     | Def Reb%|
|:------|------:|:------------:|:-----:|
| Oct |    2|  49.7% | 69.9%|
| Nov  |14 |  52.8%| 75.6%|   
| Dec |   14|   51.9% | 78.4%|
| Jan|  15 | 53.3%| 78.6%|
|Feb | 12 | 53% | 77.7%|
|Mar|18 | 50.8% | 75.6%|
|Apr| 5| 47.1% | 73.1% |

When the Pacers looked like they would win 70 games, they rebounded at 52.8%.  And when they started to fall apart after the All Star break, they rebounded at...53%.  Their lowest total, 50.8% (I don't think April is a large enough sample size - and their April hasn't been as bad as march) would be top 12 - over the Spurs and Clippers

And, speaking of the Clips, everyone slams Roy for his rebounding while DeAndre is gobbling up boards.  Jordan has taken a huge step this year, and good for him.  But the Clippers *average* a 49.7% rebound rate, below league average.

If Hibbert really sucked at rebounding, his team should give up more than their share of rebounds.  They don't.

Now, in fairness, Hibbert's personal rebounding % nosedived in March, although it was pretty consistent the rest of the year.  This fits what we all knew:  Hibbert, like the rest of the team, had a shitty spring.  But the idea that he sucks because he doesn't get REB on the stat sheet is utterly obtuse.  

The Pacers send any dribble-drives towards Hibbert, who uses his superhuman verticality to contest things.  This means he is facing the wrong direction, arms up.  Good for defense, not for rebounding.  

The real reason why the Pacers have tanked is their offense efficiency has plummeted.  That puts a ton of pressure on the defense, which may have regressed after a historically good start. 


And, while we're at it - one thing that I noticed is the Pacer's drop in pace has mirrored their slump.  If you want the Pacers to run, you don't want Roy grabbing a monster share of the boards.  PG, Lance, George Hill, 2nd Overall Pick Evan Turner (now I'm a sad 76ers fan again) are all good rebounders.  Hibbert is not known for his outlet passing and his handle is...exactly what you'd expect.  If you want to push the pace, would you want Hibbert boarding and tossing to George Hill?  Or just skip the potential problems (steal, bad pass, time wasted) and have a guard grab it?  In fact, if Hibbert read this nonsense and decided to up his rebounds, he could very well hurt the team.  

TLDR; Pacers have problems. Roy Hibbert's rebounding is not one of them.",0.52,controversial,4/14/14 2:12
716,They haven't played a single game and I already hate the Brooklyn Nets,2,10uegm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10uegm/they_havent_played_a_single_game_and_i_already/,71,1349249120,"**Upvote or downvote all you want, just please add your own opinion to the comments. I'd like discussion and debate.**

I just can't stand the whole philosophy behind the whole thing. First they move to Brooklyn, which really isn't a big deal seeing as they used to be in NYC anyways, but they come in as cocky as ever, ""claiming"" the city as their own.

Second off they aren't even going to be all that. They're a 4 seed at best, and it's the Eastern Conference. Everyone knew without Dwight they would all be a bunch of spare pieces to the puzzle, but they just won't admit it. They keep stating that they will win a championship in the next three years or something. Please.

Third - I saw a thread a few days ago where a redditor said the Nets were a label, not a team - I couldn't agree more. Most of the people who buy this Nets merch I bet don't even care about the team that much. Yeah the logo looked cool for like a month. Now everyone's flaunting it everywhere. It doesn't help that whenever I see Kris Humphries I see a dumb celeb and not a basketball player.

Granted, there are some players on the team that I like (see - Everyone but Humphries), but they aren't even in the middle of all the hype going around this goddamn team. I haven't heard a single thing about Deron since he secured his place in Brooklyn, or any of the other players for that matter. All I hear is hype. Not ""Oh Deron is working out and really getting fit"" or ""Joe Johnson is determined to work hard this season"" No. Just Prokhorov and Jay-Z being as arrogant as possible.

I honestly can't wait to see them play at MSG for the first time and get whooped. I'm not saying that will definitely happen but I am sure that the start of the season will be very VERY anti-climactic.

I know I reiterated some points a lot but I just kinda slammed this all out.

So what do you think? Nets fans, what do you have in defense?",0.51,controversial,10/3/12 0:25

Nearly Christmas time, here is my updated list of the top 100 players in the NBA + the next 75

Per feedback, I decided to spread it out a little bit as my last update was 17 days ago. Which means there are some big changes.

Here is the list:

&#x200B;

|Player|Change from 17 days ago|Comment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. LeBron James|same|LeBron keeps his number 1 spot, putting up 28/8/7 averages at nearly 34 years old is ridiculous. |
|2. James Harden |\+5|This might be a controversial ranking, and he's a controversial player on this sub. Statistically and efficiently, he's doing better than his MVP season last year now. His game is unique, it's caused a lot of discussion, and despite the team's issues he's been stellar and moves up to number 2.|
|3. Giannis Antetokounmpo|same|Shooting 59% from the field with 27/13/6 averages, unstoppable in the paint, a top 3 player.|
|4. Kevin Durant|\-2|KD was my number 1 player at the end of last year and remains in the top 5. Career high in assists per game, shooting efficiency is down from last year but he's still a top 5 player.|
|5. Nikola Jokic|\+5|His shooting efficiency is actually down from last year. But he's taking a more assertive role on offense, 7.4 APG, the Nuggets are winning, and improved defense. He's in the top 5.|
|6. Paul George|\+6|The thread ""is Paul George better than Westbrook"" has come up every day the last week. It looks like he's at his peak right now, 43 points last night, and he's in the top 6.|
|7. Kawhi Leonard|\-3|We'll see if he stays in Toronto, but he's been clutch with 26/9 averages as well as consistent. Good year so far.|
|8. Stephen Curry|\+1|His shooting efficiency is actually on pace to be a career best. He came back from injury and he's kept himself in the top 10, just the few players ahead of him have somehow played even more ridiculous. I think he'll move back up.|
|9. Anthony Davis|\-4|Career high 5 APG a game with improved defense, but the AD to LA talk is heating up and the Pelicans kind of need to get some stuff together. Either way still a bonafide top 10 player.|
|10. Russell Westbrook|\-2|Averaging a triple double for the 3rd straight season but Paul George is the one shining. That speaks volumes to the good situation OKC has. Could they compete with Golden State? We'll see.|
|11. Joel Embiid|\-5|26/13/4 averages, it's been a..somewhat quiet month for his standards but Philly is successful and he's been consistent.|
|12. Kyrie Irving|\+1|Max Kellerman: the Celtics are NOT better off without Kyrie Irving|
|13. Blake Griffin|\-2|26/9/5 averages and putting the hecklers in their place.|
|14. DeMar DeRozan|\+3|He's played well in the Spurs system and the team is back in the top 8 seeds.|
|15. Damian Lillard|same|The West is a bloodbath, but 2 months in Portland is sitting at a 5 seed and Lillard is having a career season low key.|
|16. Kyle Lowry|same|Has been kind of injured, but with 14/10 averages for the best team in the NBA he gets his respect.|
|17. Jimmy Butler|\-3|His impact on the 76ers has been clear, the team is sitting at a 3 seed and he's shooting the most efficient he ever has with them.|
|18. Ben Simmons|\+6|2 triple double's in the last 3 games, shooting 58% from the field, Philly winning, looking more comfortable with Jimmy Butler in the mix. He's a top 20 player.|
|19. Andre Drummond|\+2|18/16 averages, a truly unique player in today's game, I would consider him just about a guaranteed all star right now.|
|20. Steven Adams|\+6|Ranked 26th on December 3, I said that was likely his ceiling. I was wrong. Long considered a meme on this sub, Adams is having a breakout season and is now a serious candidate for the all star game.|
|21. Rudy Gobert|\+1|Career high in PPG, FG%, and low key having a career year. Mitchell might have sophomore slumped but Gobert is the least of Utah's worries.|
|22. Kemba Walker|\-2|He's actually shooting the least efficient he has in 3 seasons. But, the Hornets are..just kind of a mini mess and that's not his fault. A month ago I would have thought it was a guarantee he stays in Charlotte after this year. Not so sure now.|
|23. Karl-Anthony Towns|\+8|He's crucial to Minnesota's success. Unreal talent that has him a top 25 player right now but to move higher than this needs to show more.|
|24. John Wall|\+3|A 40/14 game vs. the Lakers a few games ago helps. Shooting the most efficient he has in his career low key. A polarizing player with his contract but he's a top 25 player right now.|
|25. Jrue Holiday|same|The Pelicans have issues but Holiday continues to be low key elite. Dude can put up 25/12 (like last night) and you won't even notice. |
|26. Klay Thompson|\-8|Shooting the least efficient he has since 2012-2013, but 22 PPG and he's shown the ability to go off any random night.|
|27. Bradley Beal|\+6|Overall has progressed from last season despite the issues in DC.|
|28. Victor Oladipo|\-5|Pacers are 4th in the west and he's got a career high in RPG + APG. But scoring wise he's not where he was at last year. But, he did recently come back from injury and could for sure move back up.|
|29. Chris Paul|\-10|Averaging a career low in PPG and shooting the least efficient he has since 2006-2007. But, he's had some good games still (like last night) and stays in the top 30.|
|30. Mike Conley|\+8|Will he make the all star game? This might be his best chance but the Grizzlies have been a mess since the trade fiasco.|
|31. Clint Capela|\-3|Has improved from last year and has been consistent, if the Rockets can get back in a consistent groove he can move up.|
|32. Jayson Tatum|\+7|Consistent scorer, underrated on this sub for whatever weird reason, nearly matching his ridiculous efficiency from last year on a higher volume of shots. It's been progress this year.|
|33. CJ McCollum|\-4|Career worst from 3 point land isn't good, but he comes up in clutch moments and at 22 PPG for the 5 seed Blazers he keeps a top 35 spot.|
|34. Serge Ibaka|\+2|Having a career scoring year for the best team in the NBA, I feel like this is probably his ceiling but I said that about Steven Adams 17 days ago so who knows.|
|35. Pascal Siakam|\-1|The consistency has continued 2 months into the season and he looks to be one of the more unique players going into next decade.|
|36. Devin Booker|\-4|He's been great the last 4 games and is starting to assert himself, up 10 spots from his finish in 2017-2018. 32% 3 PT is bad but he'll move up if he keeps playing the way he has.|
|37. Luka Doncic|\+16|A unique player who keeps making a name for himself with 19/7/5 averages as a teenager. We'll see how far he can move up throughout the season.|
|38. Julius Randle|\+13|19/10 averages, improved long range shooting, and a scoring threat nobody in the NBA wants to guard.|
|39. LaMarcus Aldridge|\+1|He's regressed from last year's All NBA level, but still a top 40 player who has been more consistent as of late.|
|40. Tobias Harris|\-10|Career high in PPG with nice efficiency, but with the Clippers struggles lately you'd like to see him do more. Still a top 40 player but hasn't been able to get over the consistency hump to reach his top 25 potential.|
|41. Khris Middleton|\-6|As Giannis breaks out even more, Middleton is taking a back seat but that being said he's still been a solid number 2 option for the number 2 team in the East.|
|42. Eric Bledsoe|\+6|Bledsoe is one of the toughest point guard matchups in the NBA, has upped the consistency, very underrated.|
|43. Donovan Mitchell|\+1|The shooting efficiency is down, 5-26 last night is not good. But Utah still won and the ridiculous talent is still there just needs to put everything together.|
|44. Draymond Green|\+2|Scoring wise he's clearly down, thankfully the other areas of his game have remained elite and he's still crucial to the Warriors' success.|
|45. Domantas Sabonis|\+5|My very clear pick for 6MOY right now. Continues to be consistent and has shown he can be special long term. I'm serious, in 2021 we could be talking about a top 15 player.|
|46. Marc Gasol|\-5|I'm a very passionate Grizzlies fan, but when I saw the Ringer had him as the number 10 player in the NBA I laughed out loud. He's better than last year but he doesn't give 100% at all times, and can get beat on defense by clearly inferior players a lot. Still, a step up from last year when I had him 61st.|
|47. Jusuf Nurkic|\-4|Has shown ridiculous talent at times but a bit inconsistent. Still, a top 50 overall player this year with 14/10 averages on the winning Blazers.|
|48. Al Horford|\-11|Has been injured, value down|
|49. Zach LaVine|\-4|His scoring talent is ridiculous, but with him injured now I'm interested to see the effect on his value until he comes back.|
|50. Nikola Vucevic|\-1|Last night showed us all we need to know about how important he is to this Magic team, when they lost by 39 to San Antonio without him.|
|51. Myles Turner|\+18|Sabonis might have the flair, but I would argue Turner is the biggest reason for this team's success in the month of December. Low key a DPOY candidate.|
|52. DeAndre Jordan|\+7|He's been consistent, Mavs now down to 9 seed but he's not fun to guard for opposing centers.|
|53. De'Aaron Fox|\+13|Fox continues his impressive sophomore leap and is now a borderline top 50 player.|
|54. Jamal Murray|\+2|As I saw another redditor mention, if Murray can become an elite passer this Nuggets team could become the new Warriors.|
|55. Derrick Rose|\+6|His incredible bounce back year continues and he is the clear favorite for MIP.|
|56. Thaddeus Young|\+22|Like Myles Turner, Thaddeus Young makes a big leap as well. He's been very impressive this month and a thread on this forum mentioned he should be Eastern Conference Player of the Week earlier in the month.|
|57. Gary Harris|\-15|Still injured, value down.|
|58. Josh Richardson|\-4|Hasn't been as flashy as earlier in the season but consistently putting up buckets.|
|59. Lou Williams|\-12|Struggled a bit this month, now injured and value down.|
|60. Robert Covington|\-3|Crucial on defense, has been inconsistent on offense but a very nice 22 point game last night.|
|61. JJ Redick|\-1|Still averaging a career high in PPG at 34 years old for the winning 76ers.|
|62. Jonas Valanciunas|\+6|An interesting case. Played well at the beginning of the month but now injured. He's valuable to this Raptors team but overshadowed.|
|63. Paul Millsap|\-5|Injured, value down. |
|64. DeAndre Ayton|\+1|It's been a very up and down month, but the 23/18 game last night shows just how talented he can be.|
|65. Aaron Gordon|\-13|I'm a big Aaron Gordon fan and he has a unique skillset, but he hasn't been consistent enough lately and the Magic need more of him.|
|66. Kevin Love|\-4|Still injured, value down|
|67. Brandon Ingram|\-3|Has shown flashes of talent, but injured right now and value down.|
|68. Joe Ingles|\+4|Has been inconsistent scoring, then he has games like the 20 pointer in a win vs. the Warriors last night and overall has been efficient on the season. Value down from last year but still a top 75 talent.|
|69/. Montrezl Harrell|\-6|Still putting in work with 15/7, but with the Clippers struggling he moves down this list.|
|70. Buddy Hield|\+24|Buddy Hield makes a big leap. His scoring has remained efficient and he's going to be dangerous for a while.|
|71. Kyle Kuzma|\+8|Overall progress has been made from his rookie season. We'll see what his ceiling is but so far so good.|
|72. Danilo Gallinari|\-1|Gallinari gets buckets but his impact other than 3 point shooting is minimal. Still, a big bounce back from being injured last year.|
|73. Willie Cauley-Stein|same|He's an interesting player. Ridiculous talent, inconsistent but the talent is there. Will the Kings sign him long term? IDK but someone will.|
|74. TJ Warren|\+7|Playing consistent and his ridiculous 3 point shooting surge makes him a top 75 player right now. |
|75. Andrew Wiggins|\+5|He's played a lot better in December and is back in the top 75. Still a long way to go but there's been progress.|
|76. Malcolm Brogdon|\+7|Low key having a great year. Having a hamstring issue right now but has been very consistent on the floor.|
|77. Bojan Bogdanovic|\+16|Having a career season, at 16 PPG with ridiculous efficiency. Playing consistent and making a name for himself.|
|78. Dennis Schroder|\-8|Crucial to the team's success, progress from last year, but let's not get suspended for stupid stuff.|
|79. Nikola Mirotic|\-24|Injured and value way down. Pelicans struggling and his great scoring year can't overcome the odd fit in the lineup right now.|
|80. Marcus Morris|\-5|Minor injury right now but still one of the nicest scoring threats off the bench in the league.|
|81. Jeff Teague|\+9|Had some nice passing games that raised his value (career high 8.3 APG) but needs to stay healthy to stay here.|
|82. Ricky Rubio|\+2|It hasn't been the greatest year but 13/6/4 averages with some nice games here and there are enough to keep him firmly in the top 100 for now.|
|83. Goran Dragic|\-16|Has been injured this month, value down.|
|84. Caris LeVert|\+1|Still injured but value up. |
|85. Hassan Whiteside|\-8|Chemistry issues aren't helping (and were somewhat predictable) but he's basically a top 100 talent blindfolded and it would take a lot for him to fall out.|
|86. Harrison Barnes|\+14|Cracked the top 100 early in the month. Has continued to be efficient + consistent and is steadily moving up.|
|87. Spencer Dinwiddie (RE-ENTRY)|\+17|It's been a great month for him. Nets are winning, scoring efficient, and just signed an extension. Stock Rising.|
|88. Otto Porter Jr|\-1|Injured and value about the same but after a top 55 finish last year this isn't good.|
|89. Dwyane Wade |\-3|Hasn't played all the time, but still showing why he's a legend. About to turn 37 and still a clear top 100 player right now.|
|90. Jaylen Brown|\-16|Good start to the month but last 3 games 6-25 shooting. There is no way he should be a borderline top 100 player, he stays in the top 90 but needs to step his game up.|
|91. John Collins (NEW)|\+54|Clearly a big riser. Dude is dangerous and we are looking at a top 25 talent if he can get a consistent 3 point shot. Still 21, look out.|
|92. Dario Saric|\+6|His ceiling might not be what we thought a year ago (53rd overall in 2017-2018) but he looks like he can be a very solid role player for years to come.|
|93. D'Angelo Russell (NEW)|\+13|It's been low key a very good year for D'Angelo. Has improved and is showing the ceiling he had in the draft over 3 years ago can still somehow be reached.|
|94. Jerami Grant (NEW)|\+16|He's had a great year overall and a top 100 ranking proves this. His start to the season was very slow and so was OKC's, not a coincidence.|
|95. Darren Collison (RE-ENTRY)|\+18|It's been an up and down year. Struggled in November but he's been solid in Indiana's successful month and climbs back into the top 100. Maybe not where he was at last year but still talented.|
|96. Tim Hardaway Jr.|\-20|His overall scoring efficiency is actually down from last year and other players on this team are standing out more. Still, at 21 PPG he keeps his top 100 spot for now.|
|97. Enes Kanter|\-9|Back to back Knicks, Kanter has talent..basically would be a top 50 player 8 years ago. He's been a consistent scorer though low key and stays in the top 100.|
|98. Derrick Favors|\-6|Like Kanter, Favors is probably a top 50 player 10 years ago. Still a key veteran for Utah but we'll see if he can keep his top 100 spot next month.|
|99. Danny Green (NEW)|\+6|Danny Green finally cracks the top 100. He's been stable and efficient for the Raptors all season and is crucial to the team's success.|
|100. Marcus Smart (RE-ENTRY)|\+9|Marcus Smart edges Jarrett Allen for the final top 100 spot. His offensive efficiency is at a career high and he's been a key force behind how the Celtics have been able to get back on track.|

Chris Paul Why?  Not as Flashy, but just as good a scorer and far superior floor general.  Much more complete player.  Also the most clutch player in the league.  Not that Rose isn't clutch just not as clutch as the most clutch player in the league. 

Deron Williams Before his exile in NJ was considered on par with CP3.  Has come back from injury fully rehabbed, just has a shitty team.  Pretty much same reasons as CP3  Just as good a scorer although not as flashy and a far superior floor general.


**Depends on how your team is constructed**

Rajon Rondo Best defender at the PG position bar none.  Except maybe his team mate Avery Bradley WHO IS NOT A SHOOTING GUARD.  Best court vision except for maybe Nash.  Very good at getting to rim (not as good as Rose) and not a good shooter.  What Rose does have on Rondo is a much better jumper that really opens up his game and makes him a much more complete offensive player.  Rose is a decent defender in his own right as well. Rose can't touch Rondo's court vision with a 10 foot pole.  Depending on how your team is constructed I could see either being selected over the other. 



Russell Westbrook is very similar to Rose.  The big difference between them I think is that Westbrook is more athetlic and has more potential while Rose is more developed and skilled.  Westbrook can get to the basket ANY time he wants.  Rose is a good penetrator, but he  ain't at Westbrook's level.  Also Rose isn't capable of going on the kind of offensive tears Westbrook is in short periods of time, but he is a much more consistent player and won't have the shit games that Westbrook sometimes has.  


I put Rose over Parker, Nash, anyone else as of now because while some might have better attributes all in all they are still inferior to Rose.",0.51,controversial,5/5/12 20:57

####**""Trae's only been playing as well as Luka for half a season""**  
In the last 4 of 5.5 months, Trae has clearly been the superior player. Although he still lags behind in PPG and RBG, he has been considerably more efficient (a cool 56.4 TS% vs. below-league-average 53.8 TS%), shooting better from the field, from the stripe, and from 3 (an icy 37.5% vs. a sad sad 31.7%).

####**""But Trae doesn't contribute to winning! What about defense?""**  
The Mavs are only THREE games above the Hawks, and they've gone 19-34 since December 1st. Meanwhile, the Hawks have posted 21-30.

AND Trae's had a higher Net Rating than Luka in that timespan. Trae's DRTg is indeed worse than Luka's, but Trae still contributes to more winning basketball.

And Trae hasn't missed a game this season, a valuable skill in itself.

####**""Trae doesn't have to carry the whole team on his back the way Luka does!""**

Please watch a hawks game before commenting.

Capela and CP3 had the worst series of their careers almost, so him losing to them is considered a choke on his part and has continued the narrative of him not performing in the playoffs.. He averaged 35,7,8 on good efficiency... just why do people do this to Harden..?

-Kawhi Leonard gets to the face the Warriors without KD and eventually even without Klay, he gets tremendous help from Lowry and FVV (who received a Finals MVP vote) and wins the series, and is now crowned the best player in the league by most because he's now the Finals MVP, and beat an injured Warriors roster.

- The most confusing part is how James Harden was able to put up better stats and had a better overall series against the Warriors while they were at full strength, while having a worse roster than Kawhi, yet still is considered worse than Kawhi and a continued choker. 

-And no, Kawhi did not ""completely take over games or put up insane stats in the fourth, unlike Harden""

-These things make me reconsider a little at least. The hypocrisy and media narrative really controls what the fans think and spout.


-Also to anyone who's about to make the defense argument, Curry was not a two way guy in his unanimous year, yet he was BY FAR the best player that year. Its an impact sport, Harden is a legendary offensive player and impacts the game score of the game, and his bum teammates in a legendary way. You can be terrible defensively OR offensively but if you can still somehow impact the game better than your peers, you are the best.",0.53,controversial,11/19/19 1:13
721,Dear Kobe Bryant,14,tz2x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/tz2x2/dear_kobe_bryant/,161,1337713151,"I've been a fan of the Lakers since I watched Magic and Kareem win titles in the 80s.  

I remember that wonderful summer when we landed Shaq, the game's best center at the time, and also drafted a 17 year old kid named Kobe Bryant.

I remember watching you as a child in a league filled with guys twice your age.  I remember when we played Utah in the playoffs during your rookie year, and Stockton and Malone were too much for you guys.  I remember you launching threes at the end of those games that didn't even draw iron... but I remember thinking wow, that kid is gutsy.

And when Glen Rice came to town, and suddenly the Lakers won 60 games, I thought maybe this team could be really good.  And then we played the Blazers in the playoffs, and it was elimination game, and they were up by FIFTEEN POINTS in the 4th quarter, and Scottie Pippen looked filled with confidence, I admit man, I was scared.  But you and Shaq weren't scared.  You guys pulverized them, erased that 15 point lead, and we made it to the finals.  And for the next couple of years, no one could stop the Lakers.  I almost felt sorry for Indiana, Philidelphia, and New Jersey in the finals, because they never looked like they even had a chance.

And then one year the Spurs wooped our asses, and I thought well, they need new blood.  We never really replaced Glen Rice.  Maybe we just need another scorer.  And then that offseason, bam, we got Karl Malone and Gary Payton.  And then you spent that whole year complaining about how Shaq was out of shape, how the Lakers looked ""old and tired"", and how you weren't getting as many shots as you should be getting.

And you know what, I thought it was kind of weird that a guy who averaged 25 points a game was saying he didn't get enough shots.  

And then they shipped Shaq out of town to make room for your ego, and Phil Jackson quit and said you were uncoachable, and Karl Malone said you were a bad team mate, and Shaq went to Miami and won a title with DWade, while you were all by yourself on the Lakers.  And you averaged 178 points per game, and that one game you scored 786 points in a single quarter, and the team was finally, unquestionably ""yours"", except for one problem: it sucked.  We won 34 games a year for a while there and it was pretty ugly, Kobe, I'm not gonna lie to you.  It was pretty damn ugly.

And then some good things happened.  We got Gasol... a guy who on paper was the perfect team mate for you.  A good passer, good shooter, skilled post player, committed rebounder.  He was solid, hard working, and he hardly ever gets hurt.  

And the two of you got together, and Phil Jackson was back, and damned if you guys didn't get back to the top.  And suddenly Shaq looked old in Phoenix, and I started to think maybe you were right all along, maybe your dynasty would one day be as great as Magic and Kareem's.  

But Kobe, this season, you really lost me again.  I don't understand why you played almost 40 minutes a game when you have more games and minutes under your belt than all but 15 guys in history.  I don't understand why you took it upon yourself to decide that Gasol was now the ""number three"" option on your team, and to declare that to the general public.  And I don't understand why you feel the need to jack up 25 shots per game, almost more than Bynum and Gasol put together, even though those guys shoot in the 50s and you shoot in the low 40s.  Kobe, those guys score more efficient points than you do, bro.  Why don't you feed them the ball more?

Kobe, what I think you don't understand is that being a great competitor and a great team mate isn't just about intensity.  It's also about INSPIRING people.  It's about motivating people.  It's about empowering people.  All you seem to do with your team mates is to give them muted praise when you win, and yell and gripe at them when you lose.

Remember when you were on Youtube, trashing Andrew Bynum and saying they should ""trade his ass"" for Jason Kidd?  Remember when you called Gasol ""soft"" all those times?  See dude, that's what makes guys want to not play with you.  And when guys don't want to play with you, they lose motivation, they lose energy.  

I'm not sure why you felt the need to jack up 130 shots in the series against OKC, when Gasol and Bynum combined only took about 120, even though they both shoot at a much higher percentage than you do, and even though we know the All Kobe All The Time Offense doesn't really work.  It never has, right?

So please, Kobe, do Laker nation a favor.  AFTER they trade Gasol (because they will, the Lakers do whatever you tell them to do) and AFTER they trade Bynum (because he's already asking to be traded, because he hates you), PLEASE, PLEASE do us a favor and finally learn from your many mistakes.  Don't throw your new team mates under the buss.  Don't launch up contested jumper after ill-advised fadeaway on possession after possession even though there's still 21 seconds left on the shotclock and even though there's two hall of fame calibur guys wide open.  Please, don't do that.  Instead, try getting your team mates involved in the game.  Don't ask for them to be traded, don't go on KCAL 9 and tell everyone what the pecking order is as far as talent, don't publicly question their commitment, don't undermine their games, don't tell them to stop worrying about shots and just worry about rebounding and defense, in short, don't do ALL of the things you've always done to your poor team mates.

Just be nice to them, let them play their game, and especially if we somehow get Dwight Howard for Bynum, Kobe, please, understand that he is a sensitive guy and he doesn't want to be bullied by a big loudmouth like you in the media.  Just repsect him, let him be himself, and if you lose, just lose like a man.  It's ok to lose, Kobe.  Lots of teams lose every single year in the playoffs, and they manage to do so without giving their team mates a tongue lashing in the media.

That's about all.  Also, one last thing, please abandon the Heroball you like to play in the closing minutes of close games.  It's a bad offense.  If we got to a tie game by playing team ball, then lets finish the game with team ball.  We can all read, buddy, so we know that you only hit those mythical game-winners about a third of the time.  The other two third of those horrible shots you take with 0:21 left in the close games just miss the mark entirely, so please, knock it with the 4th quarter masonry clinics you like to put on in close games.",0.54,controversial,5/22/12 11:59
722,I support Kyrie Irving 100%.,0,h8c62g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/h8c62g/i_support_kyrie_irving_100/,108,1592099558,"There’s been a lot of threads denouncing Kyrie. One said he’s “woke college kid on twitter but playing in the nba”. There’s been tons of reference to his flat earth theory, woj called him “a disruptor”, lots of folks on here wouldn’t want him on their team. All this because he believes the NBA season should be canceled. 

Let me say, as a black dude, I’ve always found that the actions that have brought change or progression for black folks have always been unpopular and decried by the mainstream. As such, often when I see any sort of movement intended to seek justice for black folks and that move is widely popular or accepted by the mainstream, it gives me pause. 

Kyrie is 100% right. The NBA players boycotting the rest of the season is the most powerful statement they can make. I saw a post on here that claimed the reason Ali was able to make such strong social impact is because he was playing well and speaking out simultaneously. Ironically that same poster accused Kyrie of being out of touch with reality. They either are out of touch with reality themselves or simply refuse to realize the obvious truth which was that Ali REFUSED to be drafted for war. Him refusing, and losing his boxing license is irrefutably what makes Ali who he is. 

Lebron is my favorite player ever. He’s wrong here. Sure you can play and try to promote however you can, ie T-shirts, post game interviews, whatever. However, nothing would be as powerful as hearing the best basketball player, probably ever, certainly in a long time, announce he’s sitting out a season to protest racial injustice. Will he do it? Probably not. Is it fair to ask him to do it? Probably not. I understand it’s hard to be a black athlete in a capitalist system. Yet that’s the hand he’s been dealt and fairly or unfairly, this will factor into how people judge him in the future. 

For everyone else that believes somehow the NBA returning gives them a greater platform and thus they can influence more change, I have to again vehemently disagree. The idea of positive change as a gradual event that just comes with more time is not good enough for us black people. It has to happen now and demands radical actions. The NBA players boycotting there season would a step in that direction.",0.44,controversial,6/13/20 18:52
723,An unexpected view of the Kevin Love trade from a Cavs fan's perspective,0,2edv6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2edv6j/an_unexpected_view_of_the_kevin_love_trade_from_a/,58,1408849019,"I've been a Cavaliers fan for about ten years now but I enjoy watching the NBA in general. Over the past five or so years the parity problem has grown out of control in the league. The first time that I personally can remember a team getting assembled that seemed to be an obvious favorite a championship was the Lakers back in 2004. Then the Heat happened in 2010. Luckily for the league these ""super"" teams did not win every year in which they are active. I've always said the worst thing for a sport is when one team or player dominates.

Now, on to how I feel about the Kevin Love trade. I fully expect downvotes because it's hard for people to grasp how a Cavs fan can be upset about acquiring Kevin Love but I can honestly say that I am disappointed. For me, getting Love was overkill and what bothers me most is the fact that there was no way in hell Love would have wanted to play in Cleveland without LeBron and Kyrie. It is blatant ring chasing. I would rather see a team win a championship with players that developed their skills with that team and are dedicated to performing the best they can for that given city and franchise than a team assembled of various all stars taking less money just to cruise to a championship. I realize winning a championship is never easy but my point is that these players know what they are doing. They know that their legacy will be tarnished by not carrying or leading the team to a championship.

If the Cavs do with a title over the next two years what will LeBron's legacy be? He couldn't win by himself in Cleveland before, so he collaborated with two other all stars. He wins in Miami but many still feel his legacy has not been fulfilled. Coming back to Cleveland was his chance but now with Love joining him he's back in the same situation as Miami. 

Don't get me wrong. I'm very happy that the Cavs will be competitive this year but I can't help but feel that this trend of collaboration is bad for the league and any championship won with the new ""Big 3"" will have a figurative asterik next to it. This is probably not a popular opinion but I wanted to see if anyone else (especially Cavs fans felt the same way).",0.5,controversial,8/23/14 19:56

Here are the facts - Lebron stepped over draymond green, green retaliated with a swing to the groin. Lebron received a technical, and draymond a flagrant and suspension. 

So here's the deal. Stepping over people, taunting, and things of that nature are typically great reasons to deal out a technical foul. So the NBA got this one RIGHT, and the refs WRONG. Lebron did not initiate any more unnecessary physical contact(unless you want to nitpick that lebrons calf brushed on green's shoulder, or something like that) so all he receives is a tech. 

Draymond green initiated unnecessary physical contact, which warrants a flagrant 1 or 2. He got a one, which still means a suspension. What is so unclear about that? If sides flipped and Lebron swung at Green's groin, the outrage would be MASSIVE and everyone would cry for a flagrant. 

Looking back at the thunder series, yeah he did deserve to be suspended but the fact is he DIDNT. If he did get that extra flagrant vs Okc, he would've been suspended for a game GSW would've likely lost. Now let's assume he's suspended and the Dubs still win out the series, and the altercation between Green and LBJ still happens. Green will still get a flagrant 1, and receive another one game suspension. So what is the problem exactly?

The only people really, who should be upset about Green's suspension should be Thunder fans. They were screwed, and that is wrong on the NBA's fault. But things happen. Everyone else on the Warriors bandwagon really shouldn't have anything to complain. Nobody earned all those flagrants except for Green so he has nobody to blame but himself for his physical play. 

For those who claim ""How should you react to nuts on your neck?!?""... Think about this. Lebron steps over him, draymond DOESNT swing, and gets in lebrons face and bumps chests with him. That would immediately result in a double tech, no suspension, the refs would have gotten it right, and we would enter game 5 with both teams having their whole squad. Point is, what Green did was completely unnecessary and warranted a flagrant one, leading to his suspension and no one has ANY REASON to be upset with the way the NBA handled this. Except of course, thunder fans.",0.53,controversial,6/13/16 17:36

They didn't talk about the new coach or the new GM and what they brought to the team. The only thing they talked about was the new second/third string point guard and Faried potentially being traded. The video was 14 minutes long and 10 minutes was dedicated to weed, JaVale's mom, Jalen's draft suit, and cinnamon. It wasn't a team preview. I don't know.

Outside of his 4 years with the Heat. 

When speaking of Lebron’s accolades, ring counting, his choice to switch teams multiple times in his prime, his finals record, comparing him to Magic, Kobe, MJ, Duncan, people need to really sit back and realize how much worse Lebron’s situation was compared to others.

Basically every other top 10ish player ever had ANOTHER all-nba/HOF level player early in their career, that helped them win a championship and achieve consistency and continuity with their organization. On top of this, a lot of them had an all time great coach. 

MJ had Scottie. (And Phil Jackson)

Magic had Kareem, Worthy, Cooper & Scott. (And Pat Riley)

Larry Bird had Mchale, Parish and Johnson. (And KC Jones)

Kobe had the actual best player in the league, Shaq. (And Phil Jackson)

Duncan had Robinson. (And Pop.) 



Even modern day legends like Steph, KD or Kawhi, love these guys taking nothing away from their greatness, had much better situations in order to beat Lebron in the finals, but if jerseys were swapped, it wouldn’t have been a contest. 

It’s not a coincidence that these players have more rings than Lebron and won them all with one team. Lebron would have never left if the Cavs would have “gotten” him a D Wade. Or a Kyrie Irving. Let alone, not just a competent coach like Eric Spo, but an all time great HOF coach. 

Just think among all the Bron slander and hate we need to remember that the guy got drafted to the Browns of the NFL. A sorry franchise that had nothing before him, and nothing after him. The only reason he was ever loyal to them in any regard, or went back, is because he just so happened to be born in Akron. 

Just saying, at what point do you say okay I have to take things into my own hands and move around. Sure, it’s led to him having 6 finals losses, but he also has 3 rings with 2 teams. Chasing his 4th on this Lakers contract. For all we know in some parallel universe Lebron could have zero or just 1 ring and way less appearances had he been “loyal.”",0.47,controversial,3/25/19 2:20
727,Why the Lakers will be 2018-2019 NBA Champions,0,8ziz7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ziz7y/why_the_lakers_will_be_20182019_nba_champions/,138,1531839941,"Like many have said recently and I agree with. You can't outgun the Warriors on offense. The way to beat them is flustering their offense and playing fast with lots of transition and fast break points. A key factor in doing this is being able to switch on them defensively. This is what the Houston Rockets did in the playoffs and held them to under 100 points in back to back games.

Now let's take a look at the Lakers roster right now.

PG:

* Lonzo - His solid defense is the only reason he's still on the team. 1.7 steals/game. 0.8 blocks. He's 6'6 allowing him to switch onto taller players. 30% from 3 last year. Still not a good idea to leave him open.
* Rondo - When he's not engaged in the game, he doesn't play defense. But when he is engaged, one of the smartest and fiercest competitors. 2-time all defensive first and second team. Getting old, but no pressure in a starting role. Able to get plenty of rest on bench.
* Isaac Bonga - Kind of an unknown. Only 18. Looks to have a really high ceiling. Extremely athletic at 6'10"". Can shoot and handle the ball. He's listed as playing ""point guard"". Capable of switching onto any position, especially as he continues to grow and develop.
* Gary Payton II - shouldn't play much if at all.

SG:

* KCP - Really solid 3 and D player. Able to switch defensively on 1-3.
* Lance - Pitbull when he's engaged in the game. Embraces the challenge of defending elite players. Able to switch on to 1-3, and some 4. Not really an elite defender, but when you want to fluster the other team, he is a great choice. I can see him drawing technicals out of guys like Draymond and Boogie.
* Josh Hart - I don't know if he's a 1, 2, or 3 - but he's able to switch on all those positions defensively. High effort player. Defensively engaged off the ball. 39.6% from 3 last year.
* Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk - High IQ. Athletic. Great shooter and can score in many ways. 6'6"". This kid looks incredible. Not bad on defense either.
* Andre Ingram - Don't expect to be a factor at all, if he's even on the team just including him because of his story. First NBA game at age 32 last year. Oldest rookie since 1964. His first game was like something out of a movie. Would be really cool if he ended up getting some minutes. Looks like a really good guy and great locker room presence.

SF:

* Ingram - Ceiling is becoming a top 5 player in the league one day. Really solid defensively. Athletic and big wingspan. Can switch onto 1-3. Can play SG or ""point forward"".
* Luol Deng - ?????? Not expecting him to play, but really have no idea? Could be a wildcard if he does end up playing.

PF:

* LBJ - don't need to say anything here.
* Kuzma - Very high ceiling. Maybe one of the most underrated players. Perfect player to play the 4 in a small ball lineup. Can switch onto almost any position. Good 3 shooter, good post moves & ballhandling. Going to be one of my favorite players to watch this year.
* Travis Wear - most likely won't play, though has ability to play positions 1-4.

C:

* McGee - Can switch onto guys like Durant. Showed his defensive value on Lebron in the finals.
* Wagner - 7 footer that can shoot the 3. Not great defensively, but a high IQ and high effort player.
* Zubac - I'm not big on the guy. He's a young 7 footer. Doubt he'll get many minutes. Would be a pleasant surprise if he develops into anything. Good backup in case on injury.

At first I thought the Lakers needed to trade for a guy like Kawhi or Lillard, but the more I think about it, why would you want to bring in an established superstar when you have multiple blossoming superstars on your roster? Kawhi would've been a good fit, but I'm not even sure it's worth giving up 2 of the 3 between kuzma, ingram, lonzo, let alone some draft picks. He barely played last season. Kawhi is a humble superstar, which I like, but his current situation  could've brought in more drama that the Lakers don't need. There are also just a lot of things we don't know about Kawhi's situation and what he wants as a player.

Lebron is the best player and probably the hardest working player in the league. He played every game last year.  These young bucks want to prove themselves now more than ever and will not slack off with him on the team. Bringing in an established superstar would've risked ruining the team chemistry in my opinion. This team has low individual egos and that is exactly what you want in any team sport. We also have future coach Rondo to motivate the team and help Lonzo become an elite point guard.

When you look over the Lakers roster, you will notice how versatile and interchangeable most of their players are. This is what you must do to win in the current NBA. The criticism everyone keeps giving is that the Lakers have no shooters. I think they have plenty for their style of basketball. KCP, Hart, Sviatoslav, Ingram, LBJ, Kuzma, Wagner can all shoot 3 pointers.  Remember, the goal here is not to outdo them on offense. With Lonzo's speed and court vision, they can and will play fast. This is where being a deep team helps them too. They have 4 ""shooting guards"" that I believe will see minutes, all of which have length, stretch the floor and can play the 3 as well. 2 great creative passing point guards that can play defense, with Bonga as a wild card. Solid small forward in Ingram. Lebron can play any position. Kuzma can play 1-4 and then 3 7 foot centers. Having these 7 or so players than can move around positions gives you the ability to tremendously reduce fatigue when you are playing fast and playing hard defense.

Obviously when you have this kind of roster, there are tons of possibilities for different lineups. I believe this is one of their biggest strengths. Let's just imagine one for fun.

1. Lonzo
2. KCP
3. Ingram
4. Kuzma
5. Lebron

I could go on forever listing lineups. There are so many good combinations. They can go small or big. They can have all shooters. They are able to combine the ""surround Lebron with shooters"" style of play which has been effective in the past with the Rockets' abilities to switch defensively which was also effective.

Let's think about the Warriors for a minute. The reaction to the Boogie signing is extremely blown out of proportion in my opinion. This guy has a big potential to be a cancer for the team. He's coming back Achilles injury. He was never the most athletic of players, but it's hard to imagine he's going to come back the same as he was. He's only a low paying one year deal. As great as a passer as he is, I believe he is somewhat of a selfish player. I can see him being a big ball stopper and disruption to the Warriors ball movement, especially when he is in a one year contract deal and presumably wants to prove his worth on the court after being injured so he can get paid next year. Something else about the Warriors that I began to notice last year and maybe I'm wrong, but I sense a looming disruption in team chemistry. Durant has stolen the show from Curry. I watch all the playoff press conferences, and I do think this kind of rubs Curry the wrong way, maybe even just subconsciously. I believe this can ruin the flow of the team's offense where one player tries to play hero ball, or they begin taking turns, rather than executing. This is a great opportunity for the Lakers defense to pounce. Klay Thompson is also in a contract year and he's made it pretty clear that he wants to get paid. Now, I like Klay and he plays great team ball but this is just one more wrench to throw in the team chemistry. And, yes the Lakers do have lots of 1 year deals, but none of these guys are looking to get big contracts afterwards. They are all there to win.

The Cavs kept it close with the Warriors for 2 games and really should've won. That Cavs team was a complete joke. Tristan Thompson, Kevin Love, Jr Smith, a washed up George Hill, Larry Nance. What a complete joke. This Lakers team is unbelievably better than that Cavs team. I know this doesn't mean that much, but Lonzo's only time facing the Warriors was November last season in which the Warriors needed OT to win. They were playing their full lineup. Obviously this is a different Lakers team and they are much better now.

If you believe in NBA conspiracy theories, you know they would love a Lakers v Celtics Finals with Lebron v Kyrie, so maybe the refs will help out the Lakers.

I think it will be the Lakers and Celtics in the finals this season. The Celtics will not be an easy matchup, but I think the Lakers will win.

Please feel free to tell me I'm way off wrong, comment, ask questions or whatever.

**TLDR: The Lakers will win because of their team chemistry, defensive switching ability, youthful energy, leadership, and their wide variety of lineups.**",0.47,controversial,7/17/18 8:05

Something doesn't show up on the stat sheet, however, and that's Bill Russell's defensive impact. 

The year before Bill arrived, the Celtics had a 90.7 defensive rating, 2nd worst in the NBA. That DRASTICALLY changed when Bill arrived. In all but one season of Bill's career, the Celtics had the leagues best defense by far, often boasting a defensive rating 4-8 pts higher than that of the second place team. After Bill retired, the Celtics immediately dropped from the best defensive team to the 7th best out of 14 teams. They went from a defensive rating 6.9 above average to one that was only 0.6 above average. That's going from a great defensive team to a mediocre team defensively. The Celtics went 34-48 that season, missing the playoffs entirely. 

He has by far the greatest defensive impact out of any player in NBA history and maybe even the greatest impact on one end of the floor. These defensive numbers do not show up in stat sheets, but they do equate into team success which is all that mattered for Bill. 

 It's clear his defensive impact was greater than that of Wilt's offensive impact. Wilt won when he took less shots, and his selfishness often costed his team and his teammates when it mattered. Bill and Hakeem are the only centers to lead a title team in PTS and AST in the playoffs. (Bill did it in 2 runs, one leading in PTS, one in AST)  

As for the ""Bill had 8 HOFers"" argument. It's easier to make the Hall when you're a 6+ champ. Throughout Bill and Wilt's career, they had the exact same number of All Star teammates. People forget Wilt's great teammates over the years: Jerry West, Goodrich, Greer, Cunningham, Elgin Baylor, Thurmond, Guy Rodgers, Tom Gola, Chet Walker, etc... In all of Wilt's scoring title seasons, he didn't win a title. He also only led the playoffs ONCE in playoff ppg, so it didnt exactly translate either. 

In the season where Wilt led the league in assists, he avoided HOF teammate Chet Walker because he liked to take an dribble or 2 after receiving a pass from Wilt, which did not count as an assist. This type of stat oriented mentality doesn't equal into team success under any means. His inflated numbers often costed his team and teammates an opportunity to improve and play as a team to win championships. 

In his scoring title seasons, he never won a title, only made 1 finals, and had a 22-30 playoff record. It was only when he sacrificed those numbers to win that he experienced success. 

""Oh but Wilt was the most athletic player ever, he could do this and that"". Bill was actually extremely athletic as well, and athleticism isn't the be all end all of basketball. There have many players with extreme athletic ability who aren't then other guys with less those of gifts. This is NBA basketball, not the Olympics. 

Again, Wilt may woo the causal fan with his marvelous numbers or tales about his extreme atheltic ability, but when it comes to the game of basketball, it's clear who had the most impact when he was on the court.

I've been a raptors fan my entire life, and as a result a huge Vince Carter fan. The original post with 1k+ upvotes has a lot of hatred for VC in it. VC did not convince TMAC to leave, he was in-fact extremely upset that Tmac chose to leave in the 2000 off-season, this has been well-documented. The post also claims that Vince himself claimed that he exposed plays to opposing teams, Vince not at all at any point exposed plays to opposing teams and instead shot that down during his time in NJ. I can't believe that post is getting so much attention with such terrible sources so I'll provide some here to back up VC and how the media was going completely against him near the end of his tenure with the raptors.

Read this article carefully, none of the Raptors players on the court heard it, isn't that weird? None of the Sonics players want to be named isn't that weird? This news came out the day after VC got traded, isn't that weird? This is an outtake from the article on what VC's response to this accusation was ""Reached late last week through Raptors spokesman Jim LaBumbard, Carter was quoted by the News Tribune as saying: ""I'm not going to comment on something as ridiculous as that.""""

This source is about Tmac leaving toronto and how he felt betrayed by management, not VC, at the end of the article you can see that VC plans to resign with toronto and tmac cannot understand why he would, why would VC want to resign if he wanted tmac to leave, when he publicly has said he loved playing with tmac and publicly wished his cousin would stay.
Source 4: https://youtu.be/gugj9qfLD7w?t=2272
This is another vc documentary from 2015, (link starts at relevant point), where VC talks about his experience with Rob Babcock from day 1 that Rob Babcock got hired. 
Overall, if VC hated Toronto, why would he even choose to begin his career here? Sure he got drafted here, but he could have left right of the get-go like many other players have refused to play here before. He resigned for 6 years, and yet people still say he just randomly started hating Toronto. There was a buildup to it, and people should recognize that.

When people bring up Steph for MVP, people shout but he's not even the best player on his own team. How can you be MVP if you're team goes 10-1 without you.

If we're using that logic, then why is Giannis not ahead of Lebron in the MVP race?

Lets first take a look at the individual stats for each player:

Giannis: 29/10/5 on 62% TS  
Lebron: 27/8/9 on 64% TS

Not a big difference either way, I will also add Giannis is playing better defense than Lebron this year he is in the running for 2nd team all-defense at PF while lebron is not in the running for any all-defense team this year.

Now lets take a look at the VALUE each player adds for their respective teams.

here are the on/off stats for the cavs and bucks:

player|ORtg|DRtg|Net Rtg
:--|:--|:--|:--
Giannis ON|112.5|108.6|+3.9
Giannis OFF|105.8|117.3|-11.5
Lebron ON|114.8|113.6|+1.2
Lebron OFF|106.9|103.9|+3.0

The cavs actually have a higher net rtg when lebron is off the court then on the court. Even though they had a poor game last night, the bench has been playing really good all year the cavs statistically have the fifth best bench in the nba. If you took Lebron off the cavs,  they would still be a borderline playoff team and might miss the playoffs by one or two games in the eastern conference.

Bench|Pts|Pts allowed
:--|:--|:--
Cavs|41.4|32.4
MIL|24.9|36.5

If you take giannis off of the bucks, not only do they miss the playoffs, but they legitimately become in the running with the Atlanta Hawks for the team with the worst record in the NBA. They have arguably one of the worst coaches in the league(Jason Kidd) and statistically the third worst bench in the NBA, while the Cavs have the fifth best bench in the NBA. 

Why is the same logic that is being used to shout down the Warriors star players every time their name comes up not being used to move Giannis up ahead of Lebron in the MVP race?",0.5,controversial,1/9/18 19:42

I know its long, probably unbearable on mobile.  Tried to format it so that you can easily see my picks without having to read every word.  Let me know about any huge disagreements you have, or even minor quibbles. My criteria is mostly about who were the best this season.  I’ve watched a TON of games this year and have been watching the NBA for many years.  I look at counting stats and advanced stats.  Team record and games played matter, but not as much as the individual statistics as those indicate individual impact and being that these are for the most part individual awards, I weigh them heavier.  Also, note that I have been working on this for a number of days now, so not all the numbers will be exact, but I don’t think a 0.1 difference in PER should change my vote.   This year was pretty tough on who to leave off for some of the awards and so many players missed a good chunk of the season.  Let me know what you guys think.

###MVP

**1. James Harden**

This was a perfect example of an MVP season.  A player that’s been great for a number of years is the best player on the best team in the league and has incredible stats.   Harden led the league in scoring average and missed only a few games.  His .448 FG looks underwhelming at first, but getting to the line 10x a game and making almost four 3s a game puts his eFG at .540 and his TS around .620 which is elite, especially considering his volume of shots.  He led the league in PER, WS, and BPM.  His BPM of 11 is a textbook “amazing year” baseline.  PER of 30 puts him in a very elite group as well.  There’s not too much of an argument for the others, this was a fantastic showing by Harden and I believe he will finally get his first MVP award.  

**2. LeBron James**

Team record is the only thing that makes Harden the sure fire choice.  LeBron had a terrible January, but he played in all the games and by my estimation he had about 12 or 13 “bad” games.  However, playing in all the games will do that and Harden, Steph, Durant etc missed x amount of games and had poor showings on top of that.  LeBron just had most of his bad games in bunches which is what people will hold against him.  The few at the beginning of the year were mainly because he was pulled from the games early as the cavs got dicked down so hard in the first half they had no shot at a comeback.  The games in January were quite disturbing as well, but still, LeBron made over 10 FG a game for the first time since coming back to Cleveland and played the most minutes in the league while posting a career high in assists.  His efficiency is almost exactly what it was last year and topped only by his best three Miami years.  He had one of the years best performances in his 57 point assault in Washington that had the wizards hoping Gilbert Arenas was in the Cavs locker room.  He also led the league in games with a GmSc over 25 (pretty good, for example 21/12/6/5/1 on 10/16FG is right around a 25 GmSc) beating out Davis, Harden and Giannis respectively.  In addition to the massive roster changes/inconsistency, having Lue as a coach and still being in my opinion the clear best player on the planet, I think James warrants a top 2 finish.  


**3. Anthony Davis**

Davis had so many “Holy shit that guy just obliterated the other team” games this year, I could see him as high as first on a few ballots.  He’s in the running for DPOY as well which matters to me, and he really turned up after boogie went down (get well soon bby I love you).  The narrative has been that the supporting cast is trash and well….it is.  Jrue has played well of recent, but he’s not really that close to being an all star player.  Davis is unguardable and can guard nearly anyone in the league.  He led the league in blocks by a huge margin and was 2nd in scoring in an era where the big man is less and less utilized.  This is his best season and deserves all the credit in the world.  Despite him never having won a playoff game, he still averaged 31/11 and 3 blocks against what was the leagues best defense in 2015 on .540FG.  I’m excited to see him in the playoffs regardless of their seed and result.  


**4. Giannis Antetokounmpo**
Despite a middling record, Giannis essentially lit the league on fire this year.  With not much of a jumpshot he was still absolutely unguardable and became a defensive terror.  27/10/5/1.5/1.5 on over 50% from the field is obscene and I wonder if he shouldn’t be higher on the ballot. His showdowns with LeBron this season were classic and neither player could stop the other.  It looks like the bucks will be 8th in the east which is unfortunate as I don’t think they have an asshole’s chance in jail at beating the raptors, but hopefully we can see a few “holy shit this guy in beyond unstoppable and only 24 years old” games to extend the series a bit.  Giannis was top 5 in the league in field goals, PER, FG% of 20+ppg scorers, VORP, WS, scoring, and minutes per game.  This was simply too good of a statistical season not to have him in the top 4.  As far as I’m concerned, these top 4 are without question the top 4, in some order.  The Freak vs Brow debate will be fun these next few years.  

**5.  Damian Lillard**

This spot was difficult.  Westbrook (lol no), Durant, Curry, DeRozan, and Oladipo all got consideration from me.  I think Lillard putting the Blazers as high as they were in the west when many people had them 8th or worse to start the year was the defining reason.  It wasn’t just that they won, they won tons of games down the stretch that were all him.  He just slapped his wrist and ate the other teams’ soul and sank the improbable shot time and time again.  He posted a career high in eFG and FT% at an amazing .917 clip taking over 7 foul shots a game.  While battling the other western guards to make an all star slot, he’ll be ahead of all but one of them on the all-nba teams.  During the Blazers 13 game win streak, they beat Golden State twice, Cleveland, OKC, UTA, Miami, all while lillard was posting some insane numbers.  


###All NBA 1st Team

*G James Harden* *G Damian Lillard* *F LeBron James* *F Anthony Davis* *C Joel Embiid*

So the big thing here is that I’m not cheating and putting Davis at center.  In previous years (like last) I put him as center, but he just didn’t play that this year and I would feel disingenuous having him there just so I could put Giannis in the 1st team.  Cousins was the center for most of the year and now Okafor (who is playing alright tbh) plays as center.  He’s a forward, and he earned the first team spot over the Freak and last years Finals MVP.  I covered the first 4 in the MVP section, and Embiid has been stunning on defense with plenty of offense to warrant this slot.  If I had some criticism for the 7 foot clown who is incredible at basketball its that I would have liked to see him more assertive on a nightly basis.  Too many games he took too many jumpers or simply not enough shots to be as good as he could have been.  Still, philly was sensational on defense and he had games where he completely annihilated some trash (see: lakers, los angeles), as well as games where he outplayed some of the leagues best (see block: westbrook, Russell). Honestly if there was one story line that I took from this year, it might be Embiid.  This dude can shoot, has plenty of post moves, is MASSIVE, and can take over games like few players in the league.  Just watch the all star game, he mattered, he made a difference and if it weren’t for LeBron doing LeBron things, he would have been the ASG MVP.  No one wants to see Philly in the playoffs because no one has an answer for Embiid.  

###All NBA 2nd Team

*G Victor Oladipo* *G Russell Westbrook* *F Giannis Antetokounmpo* *F Kevin Durant* *C Karl-Anthony Towns*

**Ok**, this is where is gets very interesting.  While the 1st team is quite easy for me this year, I genuinely feel bad about some of the players I left off.  Let’s start with Oladipo.  The pacers were the 7 seed in the east last year, lost their best offensive player and best defensive player and gained Oladipo.  Their pre season vegas over under win total was in the 30s and Oladipo brought them to one of the top seeds, over the wizards, over Giannis, and in incredible fashion.  What impressed me most of all was his defense and 3 point shooting.  Along with his penetration, passing and athleticism which make him a good player, Oladipo was one of the best defenders at his position all year, and shot over 35% from deep.  He led the league in steals and shot over 50% from 2 for the first time in his career.  He also had a pretty low Turnover% despite his massive up tick in usage.  He had basically identical stats to DeRozan, but was more efficient in both FG, and TS%.  Of all the non 1st team guards, I feel Oladipo is the only one that HAS to be on the ballot in one of the remaining 4 spots.  

**Westbrook** gets the second slot on the second team, and I’m reluctant to give it to him, but he played way more games than his competitors and put up enough stats.  He’s such a hard player to analyze.  I definitely think he’s one of the best 10 players in the league, but I watched him LOSE soooooooo many games for his team.  He got substantially more talent around him and a bunch of elite defensive players and it didn’t translate to wins and a good chunk of that I put on Westbrook.  But on the flipside, there were also plenty of games where the other team had absolutely 0 answer for him and he won the game by himself.  If either of my 3rd teamers had more games played I would try to convince myself to put them over him, but Westbrooks overall season value can’t be ignored.  

**Durant** doesn’t need much explanation.  He was incredibly efficient and played on a team that won a ton of games and is clearly a top 5 player.  His defense was at an all-time high, especially at the beginning of the year.  However, the technicals and ejections really did hurt his team, he missed some games with the rib injury, and Golden State generally underperformed this season so I have him on the 2nd team.  Boo hoo.  

**Giannis** I covered in the MVP section.  Along with his team record, the stats show he shouldn’t get a spot over the King or the Brow. https://i.imgur.com/Lv9FUQX.png  If you are putting Davis at center, I would put Giannis over Durant for 1st team.  

**At Center** I’m going with Towns.  There have been flashes this year of him being great, and he’s been incredibly efficient (.542/.341/.856).  His production is actually incredible given the small amount of FGAs, for which I blame/hate Thibs.  I wish he would be more aggressive and take more shots as he’s clearly the best offensive player on the team and there aren’t many teams in the league that have any kind of answer for him at all.  However, I’m not going to penalize him for Wiggins thinking he’s the GOAT or Thibs not running a better offense.  

###All NBA 3rd Team

*G Stephen Curry* *G Chris Paul* *F Jimmy Butler* *F LaMarcus Aldridge* *C Nikola Jokic*

**Ok** so the big controversy will be with the guards.  Here are the numbers https://i.imgur.com/m7PLdqO.png .  Now to me, I can see arguments for any combination of those 4 in the last two spots.  DeRozan totally fell off after the ASB and his numbers are by far the worst of that group, but the games played discrepancy is MASSIVE.  I put Curry because if he played even 15 more games he would have been on the 1st team, and Golden State was not as dominant without him.  Chris Paul was astoundingly impressive with his 3.53 ATO ratio and nearly identical WS/48 to curry.  The rockets were 47-7 with Paul and significantly less dominant without him, despite still having the MVP and a high caliber supporting cast.  He was also responsible for the second most points per game behind only curry of the group. Kyrie is a very tough leave off because of how efficient he was along with the team success.  However, as we’ve seen in the last few weeks, Boston can still win games against even the best teams.  This was the main reason I opted to leave him off. Again, of the first 4 guards and the 4 I compared statistically, I can see arguments for any combination of 6 out of those 8 with only Harden, Lillard and Oladipo being required.  

**For** the forward spots I’m totally cheating.  Butler played most of his minutes as SG and Aldridge at C, but I don’t care about how the play by play classifies them.  Butler is a wing and LaMarcus has the exact same game he always has.  I don’t really feel bad putting him at PF and Jokic at C.  

**Let’s** get Butler out of the way first.  When he played, Minnesota was on pace to win 50 games.  Last year they went 31-51.  Towns, although better, isn’t *that* much better than last year.  The coach is the same, the team is basically the same, Butler was the difference.  And although a tiny sample size, without Jimmy, the wolves are on a 32 win pace…almost identical to last year.  For someone to make that big of a difference, I have to put them on the all nba team.  Butler was also a great leader for this team.  He didn’t care about stats.  One night he would have 17 points, 5 steals and 7 assists if Towns was going off.  Other nights he’d score 30.  That’s exactly what kind of player you need on a team with a ton of talent, lots of mouths to feed and is young.  If he stayed healthy and Minnesota was in contention for the 3rd or 4th seed, I don’t think I could put him over Durant, but he would deserve at least some consideration.  Combine all this with him being one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, he’s a no brainer. 

**Aldridge** is getting some love later in the year and rightfully so.  The Kawhaiisis and not having that great of a supporting cast weren’t ideal as far as situation goes and there were plenty of games Aldridge won by himself.  His defense is also by far the best it’s been in his career imo.  If you insist on putting him at center I could see an argument over towns, I just like how the teams look the way I slotted them in.  

**For Jokic**, here’s how he compares to his competitors at center.  https://i.imgur.com/mCY1KtE.png . I think Towns is kind of in a class by himself in this group, and Horford, although great I just can’t put him over Jokic or Gobert.  Jokic is god tier offense and Gobert is god tier defense.  In the end, Jokic played quite a few more games and all other things being equal, I think that gives him an edge.  Jokic had any number of 33-15-12 games and did a whole lot for the nuggets offense which currently ranks 9th in FG%, 4th in 3p% and 5th in assists.  

Players that were extremely tough to leave off: Kyrie, DeRozan, Gobert, Horford

Players that got at least some consideration: Steven Adams, Jaylen Brown, Paul George, Clint Capela, CJ McCollum, Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell, Lou Williams, Andre Drummond, Kemba Walker

###Defensive Player of the Year

**1. Anthony Davis**

This was an extremely tough year between Davis, Embiid, and Gobert.  Both the Jazz and the 6ers had better defenses than the Pelicans, and Davis did have Jrue playing good defense, but the Pels are remarkably worse with him off the floor.  He led the league in blocked shots and was great around the rim and on the perimeter.  One of the reasons I put him 1st is that I feel he could make a similar defensive impact on any team in the NBA.  Put gobert on a team that already has a Deandre Jordan type guy and I’m not sure he could be quite as effective.  With Davis, I feel like you can put him anywhere on the court and he just terrifies the offense.  It’s often funny watching guards go into the paint with davis on the floor.  They don’t often go to the basket, they quite frequently get to the elbow, see the Brow, then start moving laterally and take a leaning fader just so as not to get their shit blocked into the 8th row.  I think he has the best and quickest hands on defense of the 3 and he played the most games.  Honestly, between these three its so close I really have to go off eye test.  I mean, Davis is first in Defensive Win shares, but last in DBPM of the 3, he has the most steals and blocks but is last in rebound percentage and his team had the worst defense of the 3.  

**2. Rudy Gobert**

Gobert had almost 1 fewer foul per 36 than Embiid, and a higher block percentage, steal percentage and an almost identical rebound percentage.  His DBPM is drastically higher and he played fewer games than embiid, but it’s not that great of a difference in games played.  The biggest reason I put gobert ahead of embiid is that Utah was 12-15 without him.  Gobert doesn’t do much for the offense so that massive gap in winning percentage with vs without him in the western conference is due to his defense.  The Jazz are currently 3rd in the league in opponents points per 100 and while philly is 17th.  

**3. Joel Embiid**

I could see Embiid winning this award and would have no problem with it.  The nerdy guy I don’t like that much on the Dunc’d on podcast has picked him as the DPOY over every quarter this year.  He is a terror at the rim but also a terror on the perimeter.  He’s surprisingly nimble and I went to one Philly game this year and he’s fucking **HUGE**.  He fouls maybe a tiny bit too much and Philly down the stretch has been strong (albeit playing the leagues garbage dump) along with the small differences in the advanced stats I mentioned are the tiny nitpicks on why he’s 3rd and not 1st.  Overall, I think it’s absolutely a 3 man race especially with Roberson going down earlier.  I thought PG was the best perimeter defender this year, but these 3 make a bigger impact on the game defensively and that’s why they’re the top 3.   


###All defensive 1st team

*Danny Green* *Marcus Smart* *Paul George* *Anthony Davis* *Joel Embiid*

###All defensive 2nd team

*Victor Oladipo* *Jimmy Butler* *Giannis Antetokoumpo* *Draymond Green* *Rudy Gobert*

**I guess** playing in San Antonio is why Danny Green doesn’t get enough credit, but damn he is so good.  San Antonio has the 6th best opposing FG% and the 5th best opposing 3-point FG%.  And let me tell you, parker and ginobili are not the reason for that.  Aldridge has been great as well, and while being less athletic than a paralyzed hippopotamus, Pau Gasol actually has pretty good rim protection numbers.  With Kawhi out, Danny picks up the best opposing wing a large amount of the time and I give him credit by putting him on the first team.

**Marcus Smart** is absolutely incredible on defense and is perfectly suited to this era as he can play great D on 4s and 5s in a pinch.  That’s probably the difference maker on why he made 1st vs 2nd team.  His ability to not only lock down a guard, but also very much annoy and do a good job on bigs if need be is a highly sought after skill and it shows in Boston’s incredible defense this year.  If there was a 3rd team all defense I almost certainly would have put Jaylen Brown and Horford on there, but I think smart was the best defender and was very close to putting JB and Al on the 2nd team.  

**Paul George** was the best perimeter defender for most of the year.  The thing about PG is he plays both styles of defense at a high level.  What I mean by that is when playing your man on the perimeter, you can basically approach it both ways.  You can get really up close and basically harass them, poking at the ball, constantly changing position, or you can stay in between the basket.  The 1st way leads to more steals and is “sexier,” but the 2nd way is just as effective, you basically try to beat your opponent to the spot they want to get to.  George is very good at both and with jimmy missing quite a few games and Kawhi out, I thought he was the best perimeter defender this year.  Giannis has a higher ceiling with his 38 meter wing span, but his defensive IQ isn’t quite as good yet.  His offense has been quite bad and that’s why he didn’t sniff an all-NBA spot, but I think the defensive 1st team is warranted.  

*For davis, embiid and gobert see the DPOY section.*  

**Oladipo** replaced Paul George as the Pacers’ best defender and holy cow this surprised me even more than his 3 point shooting.  I guess it shouldn’t be that much of a surprise given his body and his athleticism, but I was shocked he would be *this* good on defense. The pacers had an elite 3P% defense and was 3rd in causing turnovers per 100 possessions and Oladipo leading the league in steals was a big part of that.  

**Jimmy Butler** was a no brainer to make one of the teams, especially with Kawhi not playing at all this year.  He missed quite a few games so I’m putting him on the 2nd team, and while Jaylen Brown got serious consideration for this spot, I thought Butler did so much more for Minnesota’s defense.  The wolves were dead last in FG% and 2P% but *only* 21st in 3 P% and 5th in causing turnovers per 100.  Despite a trash defense, I thought Butler did as good a job as you could ask for, especially considering that he and Taj Gibson are the only players that consistently played the slightest bit of defense this year.  If you were to give this spot to Horford or Brown to reward Boston, I wouldn’t have a big problem.  

**Giannis** is at times, jaw droppingly good on the defensive end of the floor. He’s gotten much stronger and with his wingspan, he can consume opponents with his shadow alone.   There were plenty of moments where you watch him and youre like, “yeah, that guy is still just 24 and doesn’t 100% know what hes doing” but most of the time you’re like “Jesus Christ, trying to go by that guy is my worst nightmare!”  The Bucks didn’t really have a stellar defense this year, but I blame that on the “coaching” staff.  In most years, Giannis could make the 1st team and most certainly will in the future, but for now, I’m putting him on the second team despite his defensive “ceiling” being higher than PG.  

**Draymond** has been fat, out of shape, hungover, ejected, and overall underwhelming this year.  And he’s still on my 2nd team.  He just does so many things for that team, who had a pretty good defense again this year.   He can still guard nearly anyone in the NBA and switch on anyone, block Dennis smith at the rim, then guard the best bigs in the league later in the week.  I almost left him off, but he is unassailably one of the best 10 defenders in the league so I gave him this spot over the two aforementioned Celtics.  

Really tough players to leave off: Horford, Jaylen Brown, Steven Adams, Roberson, Aldridge, Covington, Jrue Holiday

Players that got some consideration: Ben Simmons, Clint Capela, LMAM, Ariza, Tucker, Nurkic, James Johnson, Kevin Durant, Lowry, Klay


###Rookie of the Year

**1. Donovan Mitchell**

It’s him vs Simmons and they both deserve it.  If I had it my way all the voters would collude and agree that exactly half would vote for each so they are guaranteed to get co rookies of the year.  It was deserved in 94 with Hill and Kidd and its deserved now.  Gun to my head, I have to go with Mitchell because he’s in the western conference, is a true rookie, was relied more on in crunch time to make a basket, and was the best player on his team this year.  Gobert helped a ton defensively, as did Embiid, but Embiid could generate offense by himself while Gobert couldn’t.  I had the Jazz out of the playoffs before the year (RIP grizzlies), and Mitchell propelled them to a top 4 seed in the west.  Simmons is probably the better player and my guess would be he has the better individual career, but if I *had* to pick one for rookie of the year I’m taking Donovan.  

**2. Ben Simmons**

Great BBIQ, great passing, unselfishness, defense, energy, there really isn’t much more you could ask for from Simmons this year.  It’s not his fault he’s not the best player on his team and it’s not his fault Utah lost Hayward to Boston and Gobert for a reasonable chunk of the year, but it’s these tiny things that are the difference makers.  His triple doubles are impressive, but to me the most impressive aspect of his rookie year was his defense.  He was able and willing to guard multiple positions night in night out, which historically, just isn’t something rookies do.  He doesn’t have a jump shot, but I could care less.  As long as he has shooters around him the offense will hum.  It’s really hard to run an offense in the NBA and he stepped in seamlessly.  This is one of the better rookie campaigns of the last 20 years and he deserves a massive amount of credit.  He also has an Australian accent so if you wanna give him ROY just for that I can’t blame you.  

**3. Jayson Tatum**

Tatum has an array of offensive moves already and is an excellent shooter.  He had a bit of a slump (rookie wall or “I just had a baby” wall) but being such an integral part of a top 2 seed in the eastern conference cannot be ignored.  He probably wins ROY 7 years out of 10, but for 2018, he’ll have to settle for 3rd.  

###Most Improved Player

**1. Victor Oladipo**

Not much to say here that hasn’t already been said.  This should be a unanimous award.

**2. Joe Ingles**

MIP is a tough award as its hard to see a difference between actually improving as  a player, or simply getting a better opportunity.  I used per 36 numbers for most of my comparisons even though I typically hate per36.  The minutes difference is just too much and its still a player vs themselves comparison so this is one of the few times I find it appropriate.  I chose not to put any sophmores in MIP as nearly every rookie improves, often stoutly.  If I did, I would have voted for Jaylen Brown and either Brandon Ingram or Jamal Murray.  But on to Ingles.  The reason he gets 2nd on this ballot is because despite an uptick in usage and roll/minutes, his efficiency improved across the board.  Jingle McCringleberry improved his FG, eFG, FT, 3p, and TS percentages from last season.  Here’s a comparison to some other MIP candidates. https://i.imgur.com/w0sPWW3.png .  To be on a top 4/5 seed in the west and improve your volume *and* efficiency is extremely tough to do.  He’s also everyone’s favorite player, so here is Joe Ingles, 2018 MIP runner up.  

**3. Spencer Dinwiddie**

This was a really tough choice between him and Capela.  Capela improved his rebounding and shot blocking, led the league in FG% and was a fantastic defender this year.  However, this award is not for best player, it’s for most improved. Despite his decrease in efficiency in every part of his game, Dinwiddie was 6th in total assists this year, and had an incredible ATO ratio.  My reservations about putting him on here was that he could be a good stats bad team guy, which I generally don’t reward, but despite not being efficient, he adds value to the team and his advanced metrics have improved.  



###Coach of the Year

**1. Brad Stevens**

Coach of the year is hard to vote on.  Is it best system? Best record? Best job with a subpar cast?  Coach you would most want for your playoff team? Who knows.  All I know is there’s no fucking way you can be in contention for the top seed while getting 60/164 games from your top 2 players.  Stevens developed this team to be incredible on the defensive end of the floor and racked up a win streak, wins against the best teams, and a stunning road record.  On top of all of this, I believe there are only 4 players that were on the roster last year!  This was Casey’s award up until a few weeks ago, but the wizardry of this youthful basketball savant cannot be ignored.   

**2. Dwane Casey**

I left DeRozan off the all-NBA team because I give most of the credit for Toronto’s success to their improved coaching, system and bench play.  Nobody had the Raptors winning as many games as the Warriors this year, and to completely change their style of play and be elite on offense and defense (until the last 3 weeks), is incredibly hard to pull off.  We all have our reservations about the little dinosaurs, but Casey deserves a huge amount of credit for what he did this year.  

**3. Mike D’Antoni**

I’m not seeing many people voting for PringlesBro, and I’m not sure why.  It’s really hard to make two ball dominant players work together (see Brooks, Scott circa 2012-2015).  But D’Antoni turned two Harden and Paul into the best backcourt in the NBA.  Their playstyle is hard to watch, but even harder to defend.  No one had them being 6 games ahead of the warriors with the 1 seed locked up by April 1st.   


Coaches that got serious consideration: Snyder, Stotts, Pop



###Sixth Man of the Year

**1. Lou Williams**

This should be another unanimous award, Lou put a trash team on his back and kept them in playoff contention until the very end, despite losing CP3 and Blake.  His 50 point dicking he slapped on the Warriors sealed the award up imo.  

**2. Nikola Mirotic**

This year, Mirotic was traded from the bulls for being too good and made massive contributions to the Pelicans without Boogie.  Seriously, you have to put the man on the ballot.  HE WAS TRADED FOR BEING TOO GOOD AT BASKETBALL!  He had an 18.3 PER and averaged nearly 18/10 per 36 for New Orleans.  Down the stretch he has been huge especially with his 28 points on 6/11 from 3 in their win in Oracle.  

**3. Jordan Clarkson**

Clarkson didn’t really miss a beat switching teams mid season.  His percentages went up a bit when he went to Cleveland which is no surprise (.458/.392/.804).  From watching Clarkson, even though he seems to have an “all I do is score” mentality, I really like him on the floor.  He can create off the dribble and knock down tough shots, he’s not afraid of the moment and always brings the energy.    

Note that I restricted my 6th men to starting a maximum of 20 games, so other quality candidates such as Will Barton did not qualify.  


###All Rookie Teams

**1st Team**

*Donovan Mitchell, Ben Simmons, Jayson Tatum, Kyle Kuzma, Bam Adebayo*

**2nd Team**

*Lonzo Ball, Lauri Markkanen, ~~Frank Ntilikina~~, Josh Jackson, OG Anunoby, John Collins*

Honestly, Im 5500 words in and don’t feel these need much justification.  No one really cares about 2nd team all rookie.  Good job I guess.

.

.

Well there you have it, hope you made it all the way through, let me know what you agree/disagree with. 


Edit: Josh Jackson over Frank seems pretty universal so I'll say I was wrong on that one. As far as ROY, please at least read the post. I said they should be co winners. The biggest reasons I voted for Donovan were his crunch time scoring, a top 4 seed in a tough western conference, and he was the best player on his team. As far as other selections, as I stated, some were VERY difficult decisions. Derozan and kyrie could be as high as 2nd team and I would have no problem with it. Horford and brown were close to making all defensive and DPOY was a 3 way coin flip. I'm sorry if my picks weren't the same as yours or I didn't vote for your team, but I think I provided ample justification for my selections.",0.48,controversial,4/9/18 19:16
732,It's absolutely criminal that Chris Paul isn't getting MVP buzz.,154,2ohqsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2ohqsl/its_absolutely_criminal_that_chris_paul_isnt/,267,1417930612,"The Clippers have heated up after a slow start, and Paul has been completely dominant. He's putting up his usual raw scoring / assist numbers, but he's doing it on a scorching 64% true shooting and is currently having the best season **of all time** in terms of assist/turnover ratio, and has the Clippers at 3rd right now in offensive rating. I'm not a fan of holistic stats but if you do he's thriving by all metrics: he's first in both WS and WS/48, his PER is 27.7 and he's 3rd in OBPM and 4th in VORP.

Yet in nba.com's MVP ladder, he's not only absent from any of the ten spots, he doesn't even get an honorable mention! Klay Thompson and Paul Millsap are on that list ahead of him! He's also only rarely mentioned in the MVP discussion on this sub or the other NBA forums I frequent, and usually as an afterthought. What gives, /r/nba? I know people love to fetishize scoring and people are going to (wrongly) penalize Paul for not giving you 20ppg, but to me MVP is a three-man race by now between Curry, Gasol, and Paul, and the idea that anyone could have him not only outside the top 5, but the top *fifteen* is absolutely absurd to me. Of the 3-4 Clips games I watched he's been consistently fantastic, so unless the selection of games I watched was incredibly disproportionate this isn't a case of the numbers lying, either. LAC is 13-5, Paul is playing incredibly, he's been the consensus 3rd best player in the league for years... why have we suddenly forgotten about him completely? Yeah, AD's breakout season is incredibly exciting and Curry is a thrill to watch, but... c'mon, guys. Give Chris Paul his due.",0.6,controversial,12/6/14 21:36

How to get upvoted/downvoted -

1. “  5’9” Shaq “ - For some reason this sub doesn’t really know how to use the upvote and downvote button so you’re in luck, post this anywhere even if it’s out of context and you’re bound to get upvotes.

2. Stroke the popular opinions ego- Even if you don’t agree with the opinion, you must always go with the popular narrative that is currently being spewed. This sub isn’t open to discussion, that is how you get downvoted.

3. “Lol” - This ones tricky, if you use this in the wrong context people will automatically downvote because they think you’re making fun of said opinions. Use wisely, preferably for outlandish takes. 

4. “(Blank) and it’s not even close” - This phrase isn’t liked by a majority of the community, if you use it, use it for concrete facts. Try not to use it when discussing players of similar caliber cause you’ll get downvoted. 

5. Talking about Lebron being bad/good- This will either get you a lot of downvotes or some upvotes depending on which side of the coin you choose. This subs kind of bipolar so careful.

6. “It’s not too late to delete this” - For when people say some stupid takes. It’s easy upvotes if you choose the takes to use it on carefully. 

7. “Nephew” - This term is used for when  someone can’t figure out an argument to say back to the person that they’re calling a nephew. So instead they resort to name calling. Will usually get upvotes. 

8. Know your context and stick with it - You need to pick and choose your battles, calling (blank) trash on a (blank) highlight reel/ appreciation post probably isn’t the smartest thing to do.

2. If it's a rig, it's the most ham-fisted rig in the history of rigging. Anybody with Sportscenter within shouting distance knows that the officiating in the NBA this playoffs has been a complete joke.

736,"Can we stop peddling the ""Kawhi Island"" apologia?",6,5xgkgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5xgkgm/can_we_stop_peddling_the_kawhi_island_apologia/,22,1488657021,"Or at least stop taking it as a gospel?

So as the story goes essentially all of Kawhi's defensive metrics (RPM, defensive on/off, tracking dEFG%, synergy sports metrics) have [slipped](http://i.imgur.com/ge618Ee.png) hard this season. While Occam's razor gives us a simple explanation for that - his defense has slipped somewhat - many people on this sub like to throw out, without any critical evaluation, this [piece](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/kawhi-leonard-is-so-great-at-defense-hes-actually-hurting-the-spurs/) by Matt Moore in Kawhi's defense. The piece alleges that opposing teams' offenses take the best wing player on the opposing team who is being guarded by Kawhi out of their offense to play 4 on 4 against a bunch of ""bad defenders"" like Gasol or Parker.

There are a few things wrong with the piece.

1) It gives out its conclusion almost at the start:

*""After all, we know Leonard is a great defender.""* 

and

*All this suggests that it is not Leonard's teammates who are dragging him down, but the other way around. If you want at least some variation of a bottom line, in individual defense, Leonard is only 53rd percentile via Synergy Sports. He was 86th percentile last season.

So we've reached an impasse. We know Leonard is an elite defender. We know he's still locking up whoever he is facing. So how do we explain these numbers, the somewhat small sample size notwithstanding?*

- and then it sets out to prove it. That's of course circular reasoning which isn't something you would want to employ while trying to prove something.

2) The evidence is flimsy. The article shows 11 possessions from 3 games as an evidence of teams avoiding Kawhi. The problem of course is that you can't generalize those few videos on the whole season, unless you want me to generalize stuff like [this](https://vine.co/v/5QJgL7rviBj) on a whole season too. The opposing teams practice for 5 on 5. Players like LeBron or Durant don't take themselves out of the offenses that are built around them because of Kawhi. No teams do that. That's an asinine assumption proven wrong by the eye test.

If you watch the Spurs games, it becomes pretty clear that the opposing offenses are not avoiding Kawhi. In fact per nba.com's Defense tracking he is defending 9.2 FGAs per game this season as opposed to 9.4 FGAs last season in what is essentially the same number of minutes per game so you can't really claim that the offenses are avoiding him. The difference? Last year his opponents shot 5.6% lower than their season averages on those shots defended by Kawhi, while this season the only shoot 1.3% lower.

3) The piece tries to wiggle around with various line-up explanations but it ultimately fails to prove why the Spurs defense gets so much better without Kawhi on the floor and with those purported ""bad defensive"" players still on the floor. Do teams suddenly start playing 5 on 5? Shouldn't the reincorporation of their best wing into offense result in a better offense, especially if a worse defender that Kawhi has subbed in for him? The opposite happens though, the offenses get 9 points worse. This causes the whole piece to essentially fall apart.

So I maintain that Kawhi's defense has actually declined somewhat. It's still pretty good and will probably be back to its usual level in the playoffs, but it's not on the DPOY level of the previous few years like some people still claim. I'll try to give some reasons:

1) More offensive responsibilities - this one is pretty clear. Just like the Spurs defense gets better without Kawhi, their offense goes down by pretty much the same margin. Kawhi is taking 3 more shots per game than last years and overall has a far bigger role on the offensive side. He also, at least to me, seems to be isoing a little bit more than he used to and that can really take your strenght.

2) Timmy D's retirement - I would say that having a good rim protector can make a wing defender look better than they actually are (far more than the other way around) because it allows them to play closer to the ball handlers and contest their jumpshots better, knowing that the ball handler will be reluctant to drive into a good rim protector who can contain the blow-by. We have seen this with PG and Roy Hibbert when he was good for those 2 seasons. And I think we have see it with Kawhi and Timmy D too.

Timmy was of course an elite rim protector even in his later years and he could've probably won 2 DPOYs over the last 4 years without anyone being able to say anything about it. Having him behind you to cover your ass really helped a lot. Timmy is the guy who slowed down LeBron in those 2013 Finals, not Kawhi or Diaw, because LeBron feared driving into Timmy. Elite guys like LeBron or KD don't really even look at their primary defender, they mainly concern themselves with what the help defense is doing.

Without Timmy Kawhi was getting a little bit exposed, but his defensive metrics have started to rebound (they were worse than they are now at the time of Moore's piece) with the emergence of Dedmon as a solid rim protector. The question then of course is to whom do you attribute this improvement.

Of course I can be wrong and Kawhi's defense is as good as ever. In that case I maintain that the Moore article does a poor job of showing that.",0.52,controversial,3/4/17 11:50

First off, I'd like to say two disclaimers: 1) this isn't to trash on Ingram, it's more of a ""tell me why I'm wrong (or right)' post, and 2) I'm a Celtics fan, but I'm not trying to be biased against a Lakers player.

Anyway, I just want to know what scouts saw in him. I agree that he has potential, and it's unfair to judge him solely on his rookie season in terms of what type of player he'll develop into- but what does he have that about a half dozen other young players don't? I just don't see what makes him ""special"", I guess. I think he's obviously a first round NBA prospect that I would not be surprised if he blossoms into a good, or even great player. But what made him such a more highly regarded player than Jamal Murray or Jaylen Brown or even someone older like Buddy Hield or Malcolm Brogdon?

And I get that youth is in his favor. But there's other 19 year olds that seem to be on his talent level. He just seems like he'd be a hit or miss mid-first rounder that I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up being a legit player or ended up being a career bench warmer. If I said that, for example, Malik Beasley or Malachi Richardson or Timothe Luwawu-Cabbarot were struggling then nobody would bat an eye, and sort of write them off as players that probably won't make it. But it seems that Ingram gets the benefit of the doubt just because he was drafted number 2, and he's getting minutes (and he's probably getting those based on where they drafted him).

He doesn't seem to have any elite skills, and has a glaring weakness (being weak, in fact). So, people who know him more than I do: what makes Brandon Ingram special?",0.5,controversial,2/15/17 16:47

MVP candidate, Triple Double Machine, Favourite son and apprentice of legends His Airness Michael ""Goat"" Jordan and Kobe ""Mamba"" ""Bryant, King of the Prairie, and unwitting pawn to bad publicity. 

Now I'm sure you've heard varying opinions on him, that he's a ball hog, ran KD out of OKC, the reason why OKC's dynasty fell through and a whole other bunch of fecal matter that people throw around like monkies. 

But is he really? First we have to know and understand his back story like the norm for all super heroes. 

Drafted as a defensive specialist with the 4th pick and considered a reach by most at the time and moved from his natural position of SG to PG this young guy with a chip on his shoulder trying to make it for both him and his dead friend had the unwanted pressure of adapting to a new role while trying to adapt to the nba.

Shouldering the blame of most of his teams bad publicity and mistakes, the young floor general along with his brothers in arm make it to the 2012 finals only to lose due to inexperience and LeBron James will to get his first ring. At the ages of 21 and 22 after trading James ""I need that 5mill"" Harden, the dynamic duo of Westbrook and Durant were expected to lead to a dynasty winning at least  1 to 3 rings during the decade. What went wrong? Was it really ball hogging? 

2013: they win 60 games and are favourites to win it that year, until Westbrook gets injured during the first round and misses half of the 2014 season.

2015: Durant goes down, thunder misses the playoffs by one game and people get a glimpse into the possibility that is westbrook.  Trying his best to will a team not built for him to a high standard he falls short.

2016: With the team finally healthy for the first time since 2013 playoffs and under new coaching leadership the OKC thunder over perform and find themselves up 3-1 in the WCF. We all know what happened so let's just fast forward a couple months.

having resigned and showing signs of loyalty to his team who have raised him since he was 19. The competitor proceeds to deliver a historic season willing his team to a playoff spot after preseason expectations were for him to go off and miss/barely make the playoffs. But still even amongst the respect put forward by players and coaches Westbrook is met with detractors trying to downplay his accomplishments.

Here, we have a 6'3"" PG drafted as a defensive specialist leading the league in scoring at 31ppg, 10.5rbs, 10.5ast.

With his team in the middle or a retool/rebuild he has his team sitting at a record of 42-31 after initial expectations were a losing record and a postseason being ""if they're lucky"". After reaching the WCF last year, his years team consist of 5 players who see minutes on the floor who have any playoff experience. 

Outside of Taj, Kanter and Westbrook all other rotation players are still on rookie contracts and they are fielding 3 rookies (one who started for most of the year). None of these rookies are top 10 picks either.

Outside of westbrook these 14 other players collectively boast a whopping 9 seasons averaging over 10.0ppg. And kanter and dipo are responsible for 6 of the 9. 

Now, dipo has missed 13 games, kanter has missed 10, and Adams was playing injured for around the first 30 games of the season. OK you say.. who cares? players miss games all the time. True... but other than the rookies these were the only players who had any off season training camp with westbrook. The rest of his team arrived during the season. 

The context is important when it comes to speaking about westbrook whether negatively  or positively. With limited offensive options the effect these have not being in the game is excruciating when it comes to notching wins. Now I'm not saying that with these guys being healthy that they would have 10-30 more wins, but maybe just maybe if you think about it, considering that his competition in the MVP race is only up 8 wins and 4 more wins would have them in the 4th seed,  you can't discount the possibilities of the context provided. 

Maybe someone can provide insight on other teams in the league whose roster consists of rookie contract players and see where they stand in the big picture because to me what westbrook is doing with what's been given to him is nothing short of amazing. After all, this is the Nba, where westbrook happens! and I think his detractors really need to take a step back and show some appreciation for the leagues MVP.",0.52,controversial,3/28/17 22:25

Even as a Warriors fan, I bought into this narrative, as I saw no other reason for his leg to do that on the play. It seemed he should be suspended.

Today the internet is flooded with [videos of other scenarios in which Draymond does the same kick on the finish](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFw0ls6oC36/), but in the absence of opponents' nuts. In my opinion, these videos go a long way to support the argument that the kick was unintentional, and that Adams's balls were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. Whether you still believe it was intentional or not, the r/nba narrative has also shifted to account for these videos. The story is no longer ""Draymond is dirty,"" and now reads ""intent shouldn't matter."" This, I can understand. If reckless movements are condoned on the court just because they are consistent, then there is nothing preventing actually dirty players from repeatedly flailing around and secretly hoping to occasionally cause injury or start fights.

However, if we throw intent out the window, then what distinguishes Draymond's kick from something like Westbrook's kick [here](https://gfycat.com/FairImpoliteIberianmole) or [here](https://gfycat.com/UnacceptableSelfishElephant)? It looks like Westbrook needlessly catches a sack in both gifs. Before today, I would have said the difference was intent. Westbrook was at worst trying to create separation between himself and Duncan in the first gif. In the second gif, it looks like he's desparately seeking a 4-point play. No intent there. But now Draymond's play might just be a bad flopping habit, and intent apparently doesn't matter anyways.

Is it that Adams went down to the ground and played less minutes, whereas Duncan was only momentarily in pain, and West seemed not to mind? In other words, is the degree of the injury relevant in this decision?

Is the argument that Westbrook's kicks were more natural than Draymond's? Is ""natural"" a binary classification for the NBA? Or are there various degrees of ""natural""?

I read some justifications of Dahntay Jones's suspension that cited his ""reputation"" as a dirty player. Is this actually something the NBA considers? And if so, who decides what this reputation is for Draymond or Westbrook? I feel that Draymond's reputation might have affected the extent to which this play blew up.

Anyways, I'm wondering in which ways this Draymond kick is unique to similar kicks if intention plays no part. I think any of the arguments I mentioned above could be made into valid arguments, and I'm interested to see what people have to say.",0.46,controversial,5/23/16 23:09

It’s the modern NBA, not 1980. Big men who can’t shoot, can’t assist, and (as it pertains to defense) CAN’T GUARD ANYONE BUT 4s AND 5s (AKA GOBERT), are not what you want as a franchise cornerstone.

Gobert regularly gets yanked in close games against teams that can space the floor and shoot.  I remember in the playoffs when Snyder had him sitting on the bench for crucial stretches against the Rockets. He only played 30 MPG against the Rockets in the playoffs last year, and the Jazz were often better with Derrick Favors at the 5 instead of him.

The playoffs are when you have your stars playing 36+ every game. But not Rudy, his coach can’t bare to play him more than 30 per. What good are you as a defensive player if you are unplayable in crunch time AGAINST ANY SINGLE TEAM? Imagine calling yourself the DPOY when you are flat out a negative contributor against elite teams.

Gobert is a bottom feeder, plain and simple! Can feast on teams with terrible spacing like the Knicks, but is useless or mid against actually good teams in the playoffs. **It’s why the Jazz never do anything in the playoffs despite having great regular season records.**


Gobert is

•	⁠66th in PPG (averaging fewer points than Serge Ibaka)

•	⁠167th in APG (fewer than Daniel Theis despite averaging 12 more MPG)

•	⁠2nd in RPG to Andre Drummond. Go ask Andre Drummond (new address: piss & concrete (sorry CLE bros but i had to)) how much rebounding meant to Detroit. He was literally traded for filler and a second round pick.

He’s a terrible scorer with no post moves who can’t shoot. He can’t pass whatsoever (averaging 1.2 APG).

* rebound

* catch lobs

* play paint defense

(Evidence),29,f5ecup,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f5ecup/oc_does_giannis_antetokounmpo_hate_james_harden/,113,1581997513,"Last night Giannis made a comment after losing in the the All Star Game that the plan was to “Offensively, just go after whoever James Harden was guarding. That’s where we felt we had the best chance to score.” Throwing shade at Harden & his defense. 

As we all know, James Harden prevented Giannis, Embiid, & Siakam from scoring and played excellent post defense. In fact, James Harden was so good on post up defense that he is currently ranked in the 95th percentile allowing only 26.8% FG% against him.

This can easily be cast aside as the “James Harden plays bad defense” narrative going into Giannis head. Which I understand, however Giannis also threw shade at Harden during his All Star Game Draft.

Giannis chose Kemba Walker over James Harden claiming he wanted someone who would “Pass the ball” 

Harden is currently averaging 7.3 Assists Per Game
Kemba is averaging 5.0 assists per game

Another fact Giannis seemed to ignore, but wait.. there’s even more shade!

Before selecting either Harden or Walker, Giannis stated he wanted the “Crossover Killer, Step-Back Master” things Harden is obviously known for with his step-back 3 & crossovers (sorry Rubio fans). He then went on to choose Kemba Walker over Harden throwing shade at him as well.

Now, many of you will say I’m thinking too much into this and that it isn’t that serious. That these are all just coincidences and jokes. However, I have one final piece of evidence.

Last year, Giannis threw a pass that eventually hit Harden in the head pretty hard. When looking back at it, he threw this pass extremely hard & fast at someone in the corner Harden was guarding. This hit Harden in the head, Giannis rebounded the ball, and didn’t even seem to care or think about what he did to Harden and continued to play. Most people brushed this off as an accident, i did too (as a rockets fan) however some are speculating Giannis did this on purpose and actually hates/dislikes Harden.

742,"My issue with Bill Simmons is he may have rewritten basketball history by changing facts in his ""Book of Basketball"" (x-post r/sixers)",3,74bj2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/74bj2e/my_issue_with_bill_simmons_is_he_may_have/,26,1507182940,"So, this is a very small tidbit, but it not only annoyed me for years, it raises a lot of questions to me about Bill Simmons - 

&nbsp;


In his ""Book of Basketball"" when he talks about the ABA recruiting of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, he says that in the pitch meeting George Mikan (the ABA commissioner) just ""forgot"" that he had a check for $1,000,000 in his pocket to offer to Kareem. He also cited the book ""Loose Balls"" by Terry Pluto in his references.

&nbsp;


Well, I happened to have read Loose Balls before I read Book of Basketball, and I remember clearly, George Mikan did not forget about the check, he just ignored his colleagues demand to show Kareem the check in the first meeting.  You see, Kareem made it clear that he wasn't going to get into a back and forth negotiation. He was going to take whatever the bigger first offer was. And George Mikan, I suppose, just didn't believe him. He told his colleagues afterwards that he was going to show it to him at the next meeting, which of course, never transpired, much to the chagrin of his colleagues - which was also the beginning of the end for George Mikan as the ABA commisioner. 


&nbsp;



Small little detail, right? Bill Simmons just changed it slightly to make George Mikan appear more brainless.  Well, that's fine and dandy for one small thing, however - 


&nbsp;



The question it raises for me is - What else did he change in that book?  What other fact did he omit or change in order to rewrite basketball history?  It puts the integrity of the whole book, AND its author into question. 

____________________________________________________________________________________


Edit - 

From Loose Balls, as told by Mike Storen, then ABA executive:

&nbsp;

>We were all huddled in a hotel suite. Brown and Mikan went down the hall to meet Alcindor and they were in there for three and a half hours. They came out and I said, ""That check got us where we wanted to go, right?""


>Mikan said, ""We decided that it wasn't necessary to give him our best offer. We figure when he comes back to us, then we'll use the check for the second round of talks.""



>I screamed, ""*You did what?*""",0.51,controversial,10/4/17 22:55
743,Sorry to true Miami Heat fans.,3,wlqzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/wlqzv/sorry_to_true_miami_heat_fans/,122,1342408562,"I just want to say that I'm sure there are quite a few loyal, intelligent Miami Heat fans who probably put up with a lot of crap on this subreddit and in other places for being into their team. Being a Boston fan in general, and a Celtics fan my whole life, I can say I know what it's like to have people make presumptions about you based on the team you root for. I know that you're not all white-button down wearing bros who show up half way through the second quarter and leave if your team is down 7 with under a minute left. But getting LeBron and Bosh suddenly made your team cooler than before. There was suddenly less risk in the investment of fandom, so you had people jumping in on it, wanting to ride a wave they didn't deserve to ride just for the feeling of following a champion. It sucks when something you love becomes so entrenched in the mainstream that every idiot thinks they're an expert. (Trust me, I'm a bartender, and every idiot thinks they're an expert.) I'm sure there are tons of you who know the ins and outs of the game and watch every game with a deep and serious passion, be it from the balcony, or maybe from the loge if you're fortunate, but most likely on TV, cause cool kids snatched up all the tickets. I'm especially sorry that your team is so cool that you can't really share the experience of what it's like to be in a crowd at a Celtics playoff game rooting for the green, with all of the history and love raining down from people of all ages who have always been passionate about their team. I'm sorry you can't look up and see the rafters and feel the moments you have only watched in highlights and know you're a part of something that has roots as deep as they could possibly go. I hope you can look around you and find some other fan, maybe some dude in a Glen Rice jersey, who realizes that what you're a part of now could potentially be the building of some future history, and I hope you take comfort in that, even if most of the other people around you might not be willing to cheer hard because it'll mess up their blow-out.
Congrats on the championship. Take care of Ray. Enjoy the shit out of your team. 
Respect,
A Celtics fan",0.51,controversial,7/15/12 20:16
744,Ranking Every Player in the NBA (January 27),3,akf21n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/akf21n/ranking_every_player_in_the_nba_january_27/,38,1548646122,"Hey All!

Another 10 days have gone by, all star starters announced, and this is my updated complete ranking list.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|Player (change from last edition)|Comment||
|:-|:-|:-|
|1. Stephen Curry (same)|Curry isn't MVP but I do believe he's the best overall player in the NBA right now and keeps his number 1 ranking.||
|2. Giannis Antetokounmpo (same)|National media wise has taken a backseat to Harden but he's still right there for MVP race, and I would give it to him if season ended today.||
|3. James Harden (same)|I watched the full 61 point performance live and dude's on another level, but I agree with the national media narrative that his style of play will not sustain long term success in the playoffs.||
|4. Nikola Jokic (+4)|The consistency is starting to remain and Jokic is dominating. He should be the very clear 1st reserve pick for the all star team.||
|5. Joel Embiid (+6)|Him not playing vs. Denver honestly raised his value in my eyes, last night's game showed how important he is.||
|6. Kevin Durant (-1)|With KD (like LeBron) at this point I just expect him to go off in the playoffs. He finished number 1 last year (my final ranking includes playoffs) and he's very much in contention for that spot still.||
|7. Paul George (+2)|The all star starter nod gives him national recognition, and his play has equaled that consistently throughout the season.||
|8. Kawhi Leonard (-2)|The more the season progresses, the more I think he's going to LA. But the Raptors were my preseason pick to win the Finals and that could change things.||
|9. Kyrie Irving (+7)|Good last 10 days. All star starter, and he's by far the most unguardable guard in the East.||
|10. Anthony Davis (-6)|The closer we get to the break, I would not completely rule out a trade. But he's been number 1 this season before but with how stacked the talent at the top is him being here speaks to that.||
|11. Russell Westbrook (+4)|His efficiency has been better the last few games, Thunder winning, should be a clear all star reserve.||
|12. Karl-Anthony Towns (+2)|Last 3 games: 25/18/7, 27/12/5, 33/10/4. Dude is beasting.||
|13. LeBron James (-6)|He's coming back soon, he should finish higher than this when all said and done, but serious questions are starting to emerge. LeBron has made the NBA Finals every year since 2011. That's not happening this year and a Lakers 1st round exit is not out of question, what happens to his reputation (for this season) compared to other superstars if that occurs? It's something to keep in mind.||
|14. Bradley Beal (-2)|I thought he should have been a starter over Kemba, and he has turned himself into the Wizards' franchise centerpiece in a matter of literally weeks.||
|15. Damian Lillard (-2)|Overall I would say quietly having his best season.||
|16. Ben Simmons (+2)|I think he is a near lock for his 1st all star game. At just 22 years old that's nice.||
|17. Rudy Gobert (-7)|He's out of my top 10 but his consistency is enough for me to have him as an all star right now. He would be a very bad omission if left off.||
|18. Blake Griffin (-1)|BG is solid and the rest of the team needs work.||
|19. Jimmy Butler (same)|Despite all the drama, I think Butler is still an all star in the east.||
|20. Kyle Lowry (+2)|Arguably the best point guard in the league the first 3ish weeks but that's long in the past now. Still, overall on the season, he's in my top 20 right now.||
|21. Kemba Walker (-1)|I think he should have been a reserve but still him starting is good for the league.||
|22. LaMarcus Aldridge (+2)|I posted my all star reserves yesterday. One change: I now have Aldridge in over Klay for the 12th spot.||
|23. Donovan Mitchell (+11)|Biggest comeback of 2019 goes to him without question so far.||
|24. Klay Thompson (-3)|He's made 4 straight all star games, a 5th is in jeopardy. It's going to be very close.||
|25. Jrue Holiday (+3)|He keeps finding ways to stay in the elite mix. Although I don't have him in right now, he is a legitimate all star contender.||
|26. Victor Oladipo (+1)|The most unfortunate injury of the season so far.||
|27. DeMar DeRozan (-4)|He was an all star lock even a month ago, but now he's probably not getting in.||
|28. Jusuf Nurkic (+8)|Dude's on the rise. He isn't close to the scoring level as most players above him yet, but his IQ is near Jokic level. He'll have to play consistent to move up higher than this, as now that he's ranked here he has to prove it.||
|29. Steven Adams (-3)|Remains consistent and still a career season, I had him as an all star in late December but I'm going with no.||
|30. Luka Doncic (same)|In the East he would 110% be an all star. I wouldn't be totally surprised to see him get in the West but I think not this year.||
|31. Pascal Siakam (+7)|His consistent play is a big reason the Raptors have remained elite, and with how the East is shaped I believe he is an all star.||
|32. Khris Middleton (+1)|Middleton is currently my 12th pick for the East team. The top upvoted comment on NBA was saying Bledsoe deserves it over him. I disagree. Bledsoe looks like a top 20 overall player at times but he just doesn't keep that level of play consistent over a season. Middleton has played solid and consistent just about the whole season, and with how the East is I give him the all star nod right now.||
|33. CJ McCollum (-2)|If he were in the East, would be a serious all star candidate.||
|34. Draymond Green (-9)|Being more consistent on offense got him a top 25 spot 10 days ago. That consistency hasn't been there since last edition.||
|35. DeMarcus Cousins (NEW)|His fit with Golden State is even better than expected, he takes this team to a new dimension.||
|36. Mike Conley (+6)|As a Grizzlies fan, I would prefer to keep him to Gasol. For the love of humanity even with a tank watching the Shelvin Mack show the last 2 months would be too much.||
|37. Jayson Tatum (-2)|Not quite an all star this year, but my early bet is he will be in 2020.||
|38. Al Horford (+3)|Dude's been playing consistent, clutch and his impact has gone up in 2019.||
|39. Clint Capela (-10)|Injured and value down, which is unfortunate because the way he was playing pre injury he was trending to be a serious all star candidate by now.||
|40. Andre Drummond (-8)|I hate using the term ""empty stats"" and Drummond is very talented, but for 2019 that term is appropriate at times.||
|41. Julius Randle (-4)|Quiet last 10 days, but as I said in my reserve article I would pick him as an all star over Tobias Harris if it came down to those 2.||
|42. Tobias Harris (+4)|Good player, small progression from last season, I don't think he's an all star. He plays better against bad teams than playoff contenders, one of the weirdest players to rank all season.||
|43. John Wall (-3)|Him being 72nd in fan voting wow. His clout took a 180||
|44. Nikola Vucevic (+6)|The Lakers giving up assets for Vucevic is probably a mistake, but I do think he would fit well next to LeBron.||
|45. Buddy Hield (+9)|His consistency and impressive scoring ability gives him a nice bump to the top 45. Very impressive season.||
|46. Domantas Sabonis (-7)|He's been consistent but..from analyzing him a little more that's maybe not always in important clutch situations.||
|47. Serge Ibaka (+2)|Has scored in double figures 12 straight games.||
|48. Eric Bledsoe (+5)|A 40% 3 point shooting Eric Bledsoe would be a top 20 overall player.||
|49. Malcolm Brogdon (+6)|He might get the award for most consistent player on the year. Makes an unexpected jump into the top 50 with 16/5/3 averages and great efficiency. The Bucks join Warriors/Raptors as only teams with 4 top 50 players. As a matter of fact, the Warriors/Raptors/Bucks have 25% of all top 50 players.||
|50. John Collins (-2)|Still playing impressive enough to keep his top 50 spot.||
|51. Myles Turner (-6)|You would like to see him take over with Oladipo now out, we'll see what happens.||
|52. Chris Paul (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|53. Devin Booker (-6)|In 2019 Booker is shooting 31% from 3 point land, the Suns are a mess, I understand he doesn't have much to work with just an unfortunate situation all around.||
|54. Lou Williams (-2)|Congrats on 1st triple double.||
|55. Marc Gasol (+3)|If we are looking at the last few days of Gasol in Memphis it's been a good 10+ years.||
|56. De'Aaron Fox (-12)|Since last edition he's shooting 37% from the field.||
|57. Thaddeus Young (+3)|23/15 against the Raptors shows just how good this guy is. Consistently helps the Pacers win, finished 63rd last season and is even higher than that right now.||
|58. Jamal Murray (-7)|As I've said all year if he can consistently play like he can when on, a top 25 player.||
|59. DeAndre Jordan (-3)|As is the case with Drummond, he feels like an ""empty stats"" guy sometimes.||
|60. Montrezl Harrell (-1)|He's remained consistent off the bench the whole season, a near lock for a top 100 finish and probably top 75 minimum.||
|61. Danilo Gallinari (-4)|Injured and value down.||
|62. D'Angelo Russell (+13)|Since January 2 he's up 40 overall spots. No player in the league is making a serious name for himself at a quicker rate.||
|63. Kyle Kuzma (+1)|Around this part in the ranking, a theme emerges where the talent =/ consistency.||
|64. Zach LaVine (-3)|Despite the Bulls' mess, he is unquestionably having himself a very good season.||
|65. DeAndre Ayton (-3)|With Ayton injured we get to watch the Dragan Bender show.||
|66. Aaron Gordon (+3)|22/11/6 vs. Wizards last game was good.||
|67. JJ Redick (+3)|Consistently getting buckets still.||
|68. Josh Richardson (-3)|Talented, makes impressive plays, but right now this is a more appropriate ranking than the 54th he was at January 2.||
|69. Derrick Rose (-3)|It's been a slow last 10 days.||
|70. Andrew Wiggins (+1)|He's not a bust. Below expectations sure, but not a bust.||
|71. Robert Covington (-8)|Still injured, value down.||
|72. Spencer Dinwiddie (+12)|The injury is unfortunate, but he at least played well enough to where it's highly unlikely he falls out of the top 100 (or even top 90) before he comes back.||
|73. Joe Ingles (-1)|Playing well in his role, just not being asked as much in terms of scoring.||
|74. Paul Millsap (-7)|He's not where he was at pre getting injured for 3 weeks but still top 75.||
|75. Brandon Ingram (-7)|I would seriously consider trading him.||
|76. Hassan Whiteside (+3)|22/16 vs. the Clippers was good. But not enough of those type games.||
|77. Gary Harris (-4)|He's looked good the last few games, just needs to build momentum.||
|78. Willie Cauley-Stein (-4)|""He doesn't contribute to winning basketball"" well he's started every game this season for an above .500 Kings team and has scored in double figures 11 of the last 12 games. He did move down, but a ""so overrated he's underrated"" player.||
|79. Jerami Grant (+1)|What a season for him so far. Very impressed.||
|80. Brook Lopez (+5)|Up 13 spots since January 2. Good to see him have a nice bounce back year.||
|81. Bojan Bogdanovic (same)|He's going to be asked to have a more prominent role with Oladipo out, interested to see what happened.||
|82. Jarrett Allen (+8)|Up 17 spots since January 2. You'd like to see more offensive consistency but this man has some seriously scary potential.||
|83. Darren Collison (+6)|15/7 on 47% shooting last 5 games.||
|84. Marcus Morris (-6)|One of my favorite role players in the entire league, but the claim I witnessed yesterday saying he deserves an all star spot over Tatum/Horford is just absurd.||
|85. Jonas Valanciunas (-9)|Still injured and value down.||
|86. Bogdan Bogdanovic (-3)|A little inconsistent (followed up 16/9/8 with being shut down by Memphis) but clearly a top 100 talent this year.||
|87. Kevin Love (-10)|Still injured, value down. But that injury has taken a huge hit to his value at this point.||
|88. Marcus Smart (+5)|Up 17 spots since January 2. Shooting 44% from 3 in 2019 is a stat I would never in a million years believe to be something Marcus Smart could do.||
|89. Al-Farouq Aminu (+10)|This dude put up 17/8/4 with a broken pinky. But also one of the more underrated players overall this season. He finished 112th last season, his chances of a final top 100 spot are decent right now||
|90. Derrick Favors (-5)|Consistently playing well enough to hang on to a top 100 spot.||
|91. Danny Green (+7)|Very impressive game on national TV vs. Houston.||
|92. Harrison Barnes (-10)|Last 5 games: 32% from the field.||
|93. Jaylen Brown (-1)|It's been a 3rd year slump, but he's been able to hang on to a top 100 spot the whole season.||
|94. Otto Porter Jr (+2)|I think he could thrive in a different situation.||
|95. Nikola Mirotic (-8)|His impressive start to the season is keeping him in the top 100 for now, just unfortunate injury situation with him.||
|**96. Justise Winslow (+5)**|101st 10 days ago, Winslow cracks the top 100 for the first time ever. Well deserved and it's been incredible to see his steady progression.||
|97. Dwyane Wade (-3)|Wade keeps his top 100 spot, he's in veteran role but he still makes impressive plays.||
|98. Dennis Schroder (-1)|Schroder makes 5 top 100 players for the Thunder currently.||
|99. Ricky Rubio (-4)|Despite the quiet season, Rubio barely hangs on to his top 100 spot.||
|100. TJ Warren (-9)|Warren edges Lauri Markkanen for the final top 100 spot currently. His shooting performance this season has been impressive (and he's higher than his 106 finish last season) but the league continues to expand in depth and he's now injured for 2-3 weeks.||

&#x200B;",0.51,controversial,1/27/19 19:28
745,"[OC] Other ""Coach of the Year"" ballots may have more legitimacy or accuracy, but this is the only one that ranks the candidates from # 1 all the way to # 30",137,hxn56q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxn56q/oc_other_coach_of_the_year_ballots_may_have_more/,78,1595714279,"The NBA league office announced that all awards will be officially based on play PRIOR to the bubble. With that, the cases are locked, the campaigns are closed, and the voting will begin.

Rather than give a traditional ""Coach of the Year"" ballot that ranks from 1-3, I thought it may be an interesting (and indulgent) exercise to go all the way from 1-30.

Some caveats:

--- We're ranking coaches based on their performance THIS SEASON only. Obviously, Billy Donovan isn't as good of a coach as Gregg Popovich. However, if you were only ranking their ""Coach of the Year"" candidacy for this particular season, Donovan has a better campaign argument.

--- Since I don't watch every game for every team, I'm going to have to resort to a bigger picture analysis. If you're a diehard fan of your team who watches every game, you'd have a lot better insight into a coach's game management and situational adjustments. Let us know how you feel about that -- is your coach underrated? Overrated?

--- Personally, I'm going to rank coaches that *started* the year (as opposed to interim replacements.) That’s important to mention off the bat, because it applies right away —

######**the complete [COACH OF THE YEAR](https://next-episode.net/coach/season-8) Ballot**

**(30) David Fizdale, N.Y. Knicks: 4-18 record**

David Fizdale became a head coach with so much fanfare and media approval that his fall from grace has been more dramatic than Icarus. This year, he got fired 22 games into his second season on the job. Amazingly, this isn't the first time that's happened to him. Back in Memphis, he also got fired 19 games into his second season on the job.

We don't know exactly what goes on behind the scenes, but it can't be good. Do you know how bad things must be going to get fired 20 games into a season? That's like being halfway through sex with someone and saying: *ya know, I think I need to leave...* Something seriously FUNKY must have going on in there. Raging herpes. Oozing puss. Rotten vagina.

I don't want to call David Fizdale the rotten vagina of coaches, but his tenure with the Knicks did smell pretty funky. The team (right or wrong) signed a bunch of veterans with the intention to strive for the 8th seed, but they flopped. Ultimately, the real goal was giving their young prospects an environment to grow, but that didn't happen either. Dennis Smith and Kevin Knox are somehow getting worse and worse. 

The Knicks did a full house cleaning, but it may be some time before the smell is out of the building.

---

**(29) John Beilein, Cleveland: 14-40 record**

If you think it's difficult to get fired 20 games into a season, imagine getting fired halfway through your first year on the job right after you've signed a lucrative FIVE-YEAR contract. 

With John Beilein, we know more clearly what went wrong. In hindsight, it was a mistake to think that the 67-year-old Beilein could make the transition to the NBA after a lifetime in college. He simply didn't mesh with the ""thugs/slugs"" in the NBA, causing the Cavs to pull the plug before a full-out mutiny.

Given this disaster, how can we rank Beilein higher than Fizdale? We're splitting hairs, but there are a few more positives. Beilein's Cavs had a better record than Fizdale's Knicks despite lower expectations (based on over/under.) Beilein also ""resigned,"" meaning the decision to part was at least somewhat mutual. He realized the error of his ways, and handed things over to an experienced assistant in J.B. Bickerstaff. As embarrassing and costly as the Beilein era may have been, it's hard to see much long-term damage for the franchise.

---

**(28) Scottie Brooks, Washington: 24-40 record**

With John Wall injured, the Washington Wizards would have a hard time competing for the playoffs. Still, Scottie Brooks didn't help matters. The team ranked dead last in defensive rating by a good margin, indicating some serious issues with the system and the effort level. Even Bradley Beal looked disengaged on that end, ranking as one of the worst defenders in the league.

More than anything, Brooks' crime is a slow adjustment to that problem. Despite their defensive issues, he continued to start league [LVP](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) Isaiah Thomas for 37 games. Brooks seems like a likable guy, but his slow trigger has defined and tarnished his coaching career so far.

---

**(27) Jim Boylen, Chicago: 22-43 record**

Even his defenders would say Jim Boylen is about as cuddly as a cactus and charming as an eel. His players' support for him ranges behind tepid indifference and downright annoyance. Still, sometimes it takes a Grinch to get young players locked in on defense. To his credit, Boylen did improve the Bulls on that end. Their defensive rating leapt up from 25th to 14th this season.

But at the end of the day, the overall results simply aren't here. Despite offensive-minded youngsters like Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen (marginalized this year), the Bulls ranked 27th in offensive rating. Largely as a result, they were on pace to win 27.7 games, well short of their 33.5 over/under. Being ""likable"" and being ""successful"" don't go hand in hand, but NBA coaches need to check 1 of those 2 boxes to survive. So far, Boylen has gone 0 for 2.

---

**(26) Lloyd Pierce, Atlanta: 20-47 record**

The Atlanta Hawks hired Lloyd Pierce on the basis of his defensive reputation, but we've seen little evidence of that on the court so far. In his first year on the job, the Hawks ranked 27th in defensive rating. After a full year of training and development in his system, they climbed all the way up to... 28th. Through it all, franchise player Trae Young looks completely lost, grading as a worse defender than our LVP Isaiah Thomas. 

There's not much evidence that Pierce is a BAD coach, but there's not much evidence that he's going to be able to cure what ails them either. He'll probably get another season or two on the job from the patient franchise, but he needs to make some improvements eventually. Young is an albatross on defense, sure, but one little guard shouldn't be enough to sink you like this. (For evidence, consider Boston ranked 4th in defense during lil' Isaiah Thomas' near-MVP season.)

---

**(25) Kenny Atkinson, Brooklyn: 28-34 record**

Our third coach who got fired midseason actually ranks higher than others. On the court, it's hard to find much fault in Kenny Atkinson's performance. Despite having two max players on the shelf, he still had his Nets in the playoff race. They weren't any great shakes, but they were competitive.

However, we have to acknowledge that the job of an NBA coach goes beyond offensive and defensive ratings. It's also about managing a locker room, and managing egos. The Nets had built a good culture before this, but that culture presumably got rocked by the arrival of their new stars. It's up to Atkinson to bridge that gap, and instead it swallowed him whole.

---

**(24) Ryan Saunders, Minnesota: 19-45 record**

The Minnesota Timberwolves will fall well short of their preseason expectations (35.5 over/under), and will continue to waste Karl-Anthony Towns' historically good offensive talent. It's still unclear if young pup Ryan Saunders should have been handed this job at such a young age; he hasn't proven that he deserves it yet.

If there's any consolation, it's that Saunders appears in lock step with executive Gersson Rosas in terms of preferred playing style. Rosas came over from Houston with a desire to create more of a Morey-Ball approach. Saunders is doing his part, cranking up the gas to keep the team 3rd in pace, 3rd in three-point attempts, 3rd in free-throw attempts. The results don't match up yet, but at least they're on the same page. For now. Time will tell whether a new ownership group will come in and rip up that playbook.

---

**(23) Gregg Popovich, San Antonio: 27-36 record**

I imagine this low ranking will be among the least popular picks on the board. After all, Gregg Popovich is a legend. Even at this age, he's *still* a top 10 coach overall.

That said, legends aren't bullet proof or immune from criticism. Popovich needs to take some blame for an underwhelming year in San Antonio. The unconventional mid-range offense actually works better than you'd expect (11th in rating), but the problems come on the other end. The Spurs have struggled mightily on D this year, ranking all the way down at 25th. The rotations have been an issue there, with too much Bryn Forbes and Marco Bellinelli and probably too little Jakob Poeltl.

It still may feel weird to rank Pop in the bottom half for his performance this year, but I'd ask you: if this team was coached by a random dude named ""Joe Schmo,"" where would you put him?

---

**(22) Brett Brown, Philadelphia: 39-26 record**

This hasn't been a banner year for Gregg Popovich, and it hasn't been a banner year for his protege Brett Brown either. The Sixers made some head-scratching decisions this offseason. They grabbed the biggest pieces they could find, and jammed them together without much regard for ""fit."" Still, there's a lot of talent here. There's enough talent to justify their 54.5 preseason over/under, and there's enough talent to compete with everyone in the East (outside of Milwaukee, perhaps.)

Instead, the Sixers stumbled along on a 49-win pace, on track for the 6th seed. If this was a normal year without the COVID-bubble, then that would be a much bigger problem. The team is starting to make some adjustments and add more shooters like Shake Milton into the lineup, but it may be too little, too late.

---

**(21) Dwane Casey, Detroit: 20-46 record**

It's hard to judge veteran Dwane Casey either way based on the returns this season so far. The Pistons will fall well short of preseason expectations (37.5 over/under), but there are obvious reasons why. Star Blake Griffin got injured again, and pseudo-star Andre Drummond got traded away. 

To Dwane Casey's credit, he's tried to make a meal with the leftovers in the cupboard. Derrick Rose continues to be a fan favorite (if not an analytical darling), and PF Christian Wood appears to be a breakout success. Overall, there's no real identity or grand plan in place here, but perhaps that will change if the lottery balls go their way.

---

**(20) Terry Stotts, Portland: 29-37 record**

Terry Stotts and Dwane Casey may have a few beers after the season and commiserate together about their challenges this year. Like Casey, Stotts has been overwhelmed by injuries -- to Jusuf Nurkic -- to Zach Collins -- to Rodney Hood -- to Trevor Ariza -- etc. All this from a team that didn't have much depth to start.

Stotts and the Blazers drew a stroke of good luck with this bubble format. They'll be in the 9th spot right now, and well within range to sneak into the playoffs. If it wasn't for that, Stotts may be drawing more fire. The team's defense has slipped to 27th overall, which is hard to excuse no matter what roster problems you have. Stotts is a good and respected coach in general, but there's a chance his message may have run stale here. If they bomb out in the bubble, I wouldn't be surprised if they look for a fresh voice like assistant Nate Tibbetts for next year.

---

**(19) Luke Walton, Sacramento: 28-36 record**

Luke Walton and the Kings got off to a disastrous start given their expectations. It's never a good sign when your fanbase grumbles, *he's no Dave Joerger.* 

But after weathering the storm, there are some signs of hope on the horizon. A bold decision to bring Buddy Hield off the bench has worked out, with the team rattling off a 13-7 stretch before the shutdown. They had a slim chance to rally and make the playoffs if we played a full schedule, and they'll have some chance to do the same in the bubble. Overall, a disappointing start for Walton, but not a complete disaster.

---

**(18) James Borrego, Charlotte: 23-42 record**

It's very difficult to judge James Borrego, because it's difficult to judge exactly what was going on in the twisted minds of the Charlotte front office. On paper, Borrego did an admirable job to take a bad roster and lead them to a decent mark of 23 wins. In fact, their over/under coming into this year was only 23.5 over a full 82 games (lowest in the NBA). P.J. Washington's had a nice rookie year, and PG Devonte' Graham has been better than expected (although he's cooled off.)

At the same time, is *this* what the Hornets wanted? A ""not THAT bad"" team? As a result, they'll end up in the 8th slot prior to the NBA Draft lottery, in that dreaded middle ground. In a sense, Borrego did *too* good of a job squeezing out a few extra wins. I'm inclined to give him props for that because the franchise must have given him a mandate to compete (why else sign Terry Rozier to a big contract?). As a franchise, the team gets poor grades, but as a coach, it's hard to fault him here.

---

**(17) Alvin Gentry, New Orleans: 28-36 record**

James Borrego hasn't had much talent to work with in Charlotte. Down in Nawlins, Alvin Gentry may have *too much*. Earlier in the season, he appeared overwhelmed by all the pieces on the roster and struggled to develop a consistent rotation for the team. If it wasn't for Brandon Ingram's breakout, the Pelicans could have been in too deep of a whole to dig their way out.

Of course, some stocky rookie waddled in, and looked pretty darn good. Zion Williamson gives this team an entirely new ceiling, and has been worked into the lineup in a smart, prudent fashion. For that, Gentry deserves credit. He also deserves credit for having a consistent philosophy. His team is going to run, run, run like Forrest Gump. They've finished in the top 3 in pace each season for the past three years. It hasn't worked like a charm overall, as Gentry will be on track to finish with a losing record for the 4th time in his 5 years, but perhaps they'll finally hit their stride in the bubble.

---

**(16) Steve Clifford, Orlando: 30-35 record**

By this point, what you see is what you get with coach Steve Clifford. We've come to expect a top 10 defense (# 9 this year), but a record around the .500 mark. In his defense, the offensive talent is limited, and Jon Isaac (arguably their best overall player) missed significant time. Still, for Clifford to jump in these yearly rankings, we need to see more of an offensive system in place.

---

**(15) Steve Kerr, Golden State: 15-50 record**

WTF? Why is the coach with the worst record in the league doing all the way up here?

Allow me to explain. Being a head coach is like being a jockey. You need to know when to trot, when to stay with the pack, and when to crack the whip and turn up the gas down the stretch. And, sadly, you need to know when your horse is lame and needs to be shot and put out of its misery.

Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors realized they had a wobbly, broken-down horse early on, and put the breaks on sooner than later. As a result, they'll be locked into the # 1 spot among their NBA lottery odds. In theory that doesn't matter much because the top three teams (GS, CLE, MIN) all have the same odds at # 1 overall. However, if they slide down, Golden State will remain ahead of the others; the *worst* pick they can get is # 5. That type of patience is rare and admirable for a veteran coach like Kerr; after years of being in ""win now"" mode, he's showing a long-term vision as well.

---

**(14) Nate McMillan, Indiana: 39-26 record**

The Indiana Pacers continued to chug along with another playoff appearance despite Victor Oladipo missing more time. Coach Nate McMillan (and assistant Dan Burke) deserve a lot of credit for their strength defensively; they finished in the top 10 in defense for the second season in a row. Their scheme works well, and covers for some limited players along the way.

If there's any criticism of McMillan, it'd be on the offensive end. The Pacers found a little something with Domatas Sabonis as a playmaker (5.0 assists per game), but it's still not enough to make the team formidable offensively. Their ""MoreyBall"" rating is the worst in the league -- they finished last in both free-throw attempts and three-point attempts. Some teams can overcome that playing style, but the Pacers haven't been one of them; their offensive rating is # 18 for the second straight year. Given that need, I'd be curious to see if the team could develop Doug McDermott into a Bojan Bogdanovic - type player for them -- he hit 44.5% of his threes, but got only 20.0 minutes a game.

---

**(13) Monty Williams, Phoenix: 26-39 record**

This ranking may seem too high for the coach of a 26-39 team, but we need to consider some context here. The Phoenix Suns had finished with an average record of 20-62 over the last two seasons, so this 33-win pace is a marked step up for them. They've also gotten into the top 20 in offensive and defensive rating. That may sound like mediocrity to you, but again it's a big jump up from the previous year (28th offensive, 29th defense.)

Better still, we're seeing some strong player development from this club. Deandre Ayton still looked strong post PED suspension, and Mikal Bridges played well in the second half of the year. After all the mess and goat stink in Phoenix, there are actual good vibes here, and Monty Williams deserves credit for that.

---

**(12) Quin Snyder, Utah: 41-23 record**

Quin Snyder is an awesome coach, only penalized here by his own lofty expectations. Coming into the season, a few pundits though the Jazz may have what it took to be the top seed in the West, but they're going to fall short of that and even fall short of their preseason over/under (of 53.5 wins). Of course, it didn't help that Mike Conley forgot how to shoot for the few month or two of the season. Still, Snyder's bunch continues to be well coached on both ends, with ball movement on offense and discipline on defense. They'd have been an interesting playoff darkhorse if not for the bad corona-vibes and the unfortunate Bojan Bogdanovic injury.

---

**(11) Mike Malone, Denver: 43-22 record**

Denver's Mike Malone is in the same boat as Quin Snyder; he did a good job, but he's *expected* to do a good job. I'm going to rank him slightly higher because the Nuggets were slightly ahead, and were also set to slightly exceed their preseason win total (on track to win 54, 1 game better than their 53.0 estimate.)

Going forward, it'll be interesting to see if Malone can take his offense up a notch. They play at a very slow pace (29th) and don't shoot many threes (26th). To actually win the title, their shooters will need to step it up. If Gary Harris won't break out of his prolonged slump, then it's imperative that Michael Porter Jr. fulfills his potential and provides that third scoring punch.

---

**(10) Doc Rivers, L.A. Clippers: 44-20 record**

Stars and shooting aren't a problem for the Los Angeles Clippers. It's fair to say they're the most talented roster in the entire NBA. Given that, is their 44-20 record a disappointment? Eh. Maybe. But I'd counter that it doesn't really matter. Doc Rivers' primary mission this regular season was to make it to the playoffs healthy, and the team appears on track to do just that.

If there's any criticism here (of a team with a top 5 offense and defense) it's that their best players may not have gotten enough reps together. Do the new kids on the block Kawhi Leonard and Paul George fit with the old guard in Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell? What's the best starting lineup? Best *closing* lineup? There are still some unanswered questions here that need to be addressed in a hurry if they're going to fulfill their title aspirations in the bubble.

---

**(9) Taylor Jenkins, Memphis: 32-33 record**

Personally, I expected the Memphis Grizzlies to have the worst in the Western Conference, so it's downright shocking that they're in the 8th spot at the moment. The NBA may be trying to steal that playoff berth away from them, but that won't change the great job that rookie coach Taylor Jenkins has done this year.

Are the Grizzlies actually this good? Probably not. Their advanced stats are worse than their record, and Jaren Jackson Jr. hasn't taken the expected leap on defense yet. Still, wins are wins, and a coach shouldn't be penalized for collecting more than he should.

---

**(8) Mike D'Antoni, Houston: 40-24 record**

Based on the simple matter of wins versus preseason expectations (and an over/under of 54.0), the Houston Rockets have been slightly underwhelming this year. Still, veteran Mike D'Antoni deserves a lot of credit for remaking the team on the fly. Changing from Chris Paul to Russell Westbrook may not be a huge difference in quality, but it's a huge difference in playing style. As a result, the Rockets leapt up from the 26th fastest pace last year all the way up to 4th this season. They'll looking like a proper D'Antoni and Morey team right now.

In fact, they've taken that bold experiment up another notch this year by ditching Clint Capela and emulating [Rick Moranis](https://images.app.goo.gl/ooNpDDaJPEGFzzDM7). So far, so good. These Smallball Rockets still have some  lingering question marks about their defense and their rebounding, but they're extremely dangerous right now nonetheless. It's hard to imagine too many older coaches understanding and embracing this like D'Antoni has.

---

**(7) Brad Stevens, Boston: 43-21 record**

Brad Stevens has always been a media darling, and he's justifying that reputation this year. The Celtics lost Kyrie Irving and Al Horford, but are still top 5 in offense and top 5 in defense. Life without Kyrie has gone swimmingly, opening up some air for young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to breathe; they're both in the running for Most Improved Player. 

As with Mike D'Antoni, Stevens also deserves credit for working with a limited hand at center. But rather than force the issue and overplay some stiffs, he's understood that the team just may be better off with 6'8"" Daniel Theis manning the fort instead.

---

**(6) Frank Vogel, L.A. Lakers: 49-14 record**

It's never a good sign when you sign a new contract with a team, and are immediately placed among the favorites for ""First Coach Fired"" in Vegas. Frank Vogel walked that tightrope this season, with plenty of spectators expecting him to fail and fall to his demise.

Instead, Vogel has kept his head down, and kept his focus, and helped this Lakers team grab the # 1 seed out West. Obviously it's an easier task when you have LeBron James and Anthony Davis, but this isn't a loaded roster otherwise. Moreover, there are a lot of moving parts and new pieces to work in. The fact that Vogel has this largely-old team ranked # 3 in defensive rating is a true testament to his success this year.

---

**(5) Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee: 53-12 record**

Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is on track to win his second consecutive MVP award. While we tend to think the media likes new ""narratives,"" but we've seen repeat winners before. Since 2000, Tim Duncan repeated as MVP, Steve Nash repeated as MVP, LeBron James repeated as MVP (on two separate occasions), and Steph Curry repeated as MVP as well.

*Coaches* don't get the same luxury. In fact, since the award was created in 1962, the Coach of the Year winner has NEVER repeated the following season. You win once, you get to the back of the line. That tendency has really hurt Mike Budenholzer's candidacy this year. On paper, he should absolutely be in the running. The Bucks are once again # 1 in defense, # 1 in overall rating, # 1 in W-L record. They're on a better pace than last year's team, despite losing Malcolm Brogdon over the summer. If Giannis can repeat for the same feat twice, why shouldn't Budenholzer be allowed to do the same?

---

**(4) Rick Carlisle, Dallas: 40-27 record**

Everyone expected the Milwaukee Bucks to be dominant, but no one expected the Dallas Mavericks to be this good, this early. They've jumped the line and arrived in the playoffs earlier than schedule. They're only 1 win away from beating their preseason over/under of 40.5 despite all the missed games.

Like Mike Budenholzer, Rick Carlisle has benefited in that endeavor from a transcendent player in Luka Doncic. At the same time, this Mavs' machine has been rolling with and without Doncic. They rank # 1 in offensive efficiency this year, and depending on whether you want to factor in pace and league trends or not, they may have one of the best offenses we've ever seen from a statistical standpoint. It's quite an achievement from a coach who cut his stripes as a defensive specialist, and indicates the type of attitude that coaches need to adapt and evolve over time.

---

**(3) Erik Spoelstra, Miami: 41-24 record**

The Miami Heat pulled a free agency coup by signing Jimmy Butler away from Philadelphia. Still, it's not like people expected that to vault them to the top of the East. Butler was a good player, but a difficult one to manage. He blended into the crowd as well as a skinhead at a Bar Mitzvah. Overall, adding Butler only boosted the team's preseason over/under win total to a modest 43.5.

Turns out, Butler fit in better with the Heat than anyone expected, on and off the court. Butler hasn't shot well from the field, but his attacking and playmaking helped open up the offense (6th in the league) and propelled the team to a 51.7-win pace. He's fit in like a glove in terms of their tough-dude culture as well.

Erik Spoelstra should get huge props for developing that culture and that system. But more than anything, he deserves credit for their player development system. Sure, Jimmy Butler is a star, and Bam Adebayo had star talent. At the same time, no one had ever heard of players like Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson at this time last year. These are complete randos who will make a combined $3M this season -- just half of Cristiano Felicio's salary. Having a coach who can grow talent like that in his backyard is a huge advantage for any franchise.

**(2) Billy Donovan, Oklahoma City: 41-24 record**

After Oklahoma City blew it up this summer by trading Russell Westbrook and Paul George, coach Billy Donovan felt like a dead man walking. Instead, Donovan and those fireproof zombie hordes in OKC sieged to a 41-24 record. How good is that? Hell, it's an even better winning percentage than the team had *last* year with Westbrook and George (in a career year.) 

Given all this surprising success, Donovan would be a fair winner of this award. He's managed to take in a bunch of new bodies and form a cohesive team. He's even had success playing three point guards together (CP3, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Dennis Schroder.) 

If you want to nitpick his candidacy, you could point out that the hodgepodge roster has a lot of talent scattered throughout. Chris Paul had become underrated, and Danilo Gallinari has always been underrated as well. The team's low preseason over/under total (32.5) was largely based on the uncertainty about further trades. Everyone knew that this team had the talent to be competitive if they stayed together. Still, no one expected them to be *this* good.

---

**(1) Nick Nurse, Toronto: 46-18 record**

Last season, Nick Nurse finally got his first chance as an NBA head coach. He ended up having as good of a rookie year as anyone since [Henry Rowengartner](https://images.app.goo.gl/qJFjmHV7PFkKAmsC9). Nurse coached circles around some of the best in the business en route to a championship season. 

Amazingly, he may have been even more impressive *this* year. Without Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, the Toronto Raptors held steady and didn't miss much of a beat. In fact, they're on pace to win 58.9 games, over a dozen more than their preseason over/under of 46.5. 

Technically, Nurse still has limited experience as an NBA head coach, but he's already proven to be one of the masters. If we were to judge based on the results of this (semi-)season only, he'd be my personal ""Coach of the Year.""",0.78,hot,7/25/20 14:57
746,Giannis has played less MPG than Dennis Schroeder and just 1.6 more MPG than Lou Williams,21,hxtgnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxtgnb/giannis_has_played_less_mpg_than_dennis_schroeder/,31,1595737101,"I know one of the biggest things people highlight about Giannis is his effectiveness in absurdly low minutes, but I never really put it into perspective like this. He’s putting up an MVP campaign in 6th man minutes.

Giannis has also played the same MPG as Joe Harris, and 1.6 MPG less than Marcus Smart, another very notable 6th man. 

Granted, all of these players basically play starter minutes, but their minutes are de facto restricted on their team because the starter at their position is more well-rounded and hence deserves more minutes (except for Lou’s case) except in certain circumstances. Giannis has no such restriction. Him playing more than he does is literally unsportsmanlike with the way he dominates. 

He’s even played less minutes than “Mr. Load Management” Kawhi Leonard, despite Kawhi having a far better supporting cast to ease his minutes. 

He is 63rd in the league in minutes, putting up top 5 rebounding and points per game, and is top-2 on his team in **every statistical category** except 3-pt shooting. Not to mention top-2 DPOY candidate. 

It’s just wild that his play style is basically auto-load-managing. He could play more if he wanted to. He doesn’t have to. They still have the best record in the league and he’s the runaway MVP. 

I just don’t see anyone can make a case against this man for not just MVP but a historic season. He just can’t stop getting better. 

Tangentially speaking of trajectories, Pascal Siakam is basically gonna be this man with slightly less dominance but a way better jump shot in just 1-2 more years. It’s a good time to be an NBA fan.

747,[OC] Players who were surprisingly bad in the clutch (2019-20),44,hxnlyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxnlyd/oc_players_who_were_surprisingly_bad_in_the/,26,1595716171,"I recently made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/huw14f/oc_5_clutch_players_that_might_have_gone_under/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about 5 unnoticed players who were good in the clutch, and was suggested to make one about players who were surprisingly bad. I'm not considering players who have taken too few shots and/or don't have a large enough sample size to judge from. Moreover, I wanted to look at players who are going to play a major role in the bubble.

# Luka Doncic

*97 min, 65 FGA, 32/17/65, 41.9% TS*

Mavericks have the best offense this season but their **clutch offense ranks 29th**(!) in the league. The Mavs are 14-21 in close games, which is 22nd (W-L) in the league and they're the only playoff team in the bottom 10. Luka has a 36.2 USG% in clutch and almost every possession starts from him but unlike last year he hasn't been good enough in crunchtime. He also has the **lowest TS%** out of 29 players with more than 50 FGA.

Clutch FGs by distance from rim:

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|4-12 (33%)|6-35 (17%)|

* Luka's shot 6-35 from distance and most of his attempts from beyond the arc are closely contested step back threes at the end of the shot clock. Shots like these - over [Okogie](https://imgur.com/lk7Y1WW) or [Schroder](https://imgur.com/ydBcCWz) aren't considered good shots for most players but Luka has hit stepbacks at a decent clip (34.7%) this season. This might be the result of poor shot selection ([?](https://imgur.com/Ug20RU3))
* Luka is also 1-13 on [shots to tie or take the lead](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_id=2020&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=N&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=2&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&is_tying=Y&is_go_ahead=Y&c1stat=fga&c1comp=ge&c1val=10&order_by=fga#stats::7) in the final 2 mins
* He is 8th in total clutch assists (21) and 6th in assists *per 100 possessions.* His assists usually come off blow-bys and [kicking-out](https://imgur.com/2cxbo5d) for a 3 or to a [cutter](https://imgur.com/XIMmnyY). He's also prone to turning the ball over but that's to be expected with being the primary option and being blitzed constantly

Ultimately, Luka (and the Mavs) need to be better on offense in close games (which are inevitable in the playoffs) because they're not beating anybody with their defense.

# LeBron James

*97 min, 60 FGA, 33/17/62, 43.3% TS*

LeBron numbers show that he hasn't really been klutch this season. He has the second lowest TS% out of players who've attempted atleast 50 FGs.

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|2-11 (18%)|5-29 (17%)|

* Out of his 60 field goal attempts, nearly half of them (5-29) are three pointers and almost all of his 3s are the signature 'stare at the ball' stepback three. Contrary to the memes, he's far from automatic on these shots in the clutch. Even when's able to get the switch he desires he frequently settles for [26+ ft shots](https://imgur.com/NnucbCo).
* LeBron also posts up a good number of times when he gets a smaller defender on him. He easily bullies his way down and turns around for a [fadeaway jumper](https://imgur.com/XcidVgd) which hasn't been accurate (unless it's [boston](https://imgur.com/dXDBh0U) ofc) or [spins](https://imgur.com/Z2GY3SE) and finishes at the rim. After watching all of his clutch shots and looking at the numbers, it's evident that he hasn't really been efficient anywhere outside the restricted area.
* Looking on the bright side, LeBron's second in total assists(26) and **first in assists** ***per 100 possessions***. His vision and passing is nearly lethal - most of his assists are from [rolling](https://imgur.com/NlMnQTH)/[cutting](https://imgur.com/UTMV0FA) big men; and when double teamed on the [post](https://imgur.com/Joq0atx) or the [perimeter](https://imgur.com/xKJinmb), he delivers pinpoint passes to open teammates.

In the end, I'm not too concerned because... uh because it's LeBron. The Lakers have the 4th best clutch record (18-9) despite LeBron's shooting struggles and it would be foolish to not expect LeBron to be a notch better in the playoffs.

# Jimmy Butler

*100 min, 60 FGA, 28/15/74, 45.6% TS*

Butler had great clutch stats last season but it's been a totally different story this season. He has the **lowest FG%** out of  29 players who've attempted 50 field goals and by a wide margin of 4% from second lowest (Luka). He's usually the primary ball handler on the Heat and has to create his own shots.

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|0 to 4FT|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|7-14 (50%)|7-26 (27%)|3-20 (15%)|

* He has taken a good number of pull-up jumpers from both [beyond the arc](https://imgur.com/JVpiIdG) and in the [mid-range](https://imgur.com/649tyHQ) with underwhelming efficiency. Outside the paint, he struggles to make a field goal and he's only able to finish at the rim [against bad defenses](https://imgur.com/5KWoJZV); clutch rim finishing (50%) is significantly worse than season percentage (63.7%)).
* Butler is 2-19 on [shots to tie or take the lead](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/shot_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_id=2020&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&is_playoffs=N&q4=Y&q5=Y&time_remain_minutes=2&time_remain_seconds=0&time_remain_comp=le&margin_min=-5&margin_max=5&is_tying=Y&is_go_ahead=Y&c1stat=fga&c1comp=ge&c1val=10&order_by=fga#stats::7) in the final 2 mins
* Clutch FT numbers can sometimes be misleading because of intentional fouls. That's partly true for Butler too but even after considering those, he draws a ton of [fouls](https://imgur.com/u3ejqH1) (much like the whole season). He's first in total FTA and FTA per 100 in the clutch. His TS% isn't decent  despite being buoyed by FTs.
* Aside from his shooting woes, Butler has been quite impressive as a playmaker. He rarely turns the ball over and makes the right passes when defenses collapse on the paint. [Robinson](https://imgur.com/IPO0VKt) (*8-21 from 3*) and [Herro](https://imgur.com/qX6PrQC) (*8-15 from 3*) have been reliable at the receiving end of these passes.

# Brandon Ingram

*106 min, 63 FGA, 36/28.6/70, 47.3% TS*

Pelicans are in the bottom 5 in both clutch offense and defense and are 12-24 in close games. To be fair they didn't have their full line-up for majority of the season. Before Zion joined, Ingram was the first option on the team and was taking almost every shot in crunchtime. 

Clutch shots by distance from rim :

|*Distance*|4FT to 3P arc|Beyond 3P arc|
|:-|:-|:-|
|*FGs*|9-29 (31%)|6-21 (28.6%)|

* Ingram's midranges are usually [turnaround fadeaways](https://imgur.com/r2mLnQ1) where he uses his length to shoot over defenders. His efficiency on those is below average. Sometimes, he pulls up in the mid-range while [coming off a screen](https://imgur.com/COh54g2) too. He's [finished](https://imgur.com/ZEwcOoK) at rim with his season efficiency.
* Pretty much all of his three pointers are [off the catch](https://imgur.com/wUkInQG) or [1 dribble pull-ups](https://imgur.com/4b7EJcT) off a screen,and he's shooting below 30% on them
* He doesn't pass too often, but has shown that he can find the [cutting man](https://imgur.com/IOmlCLR) or an [open shooter](https://imgur.com/Iu9WXcl) from the post. He was constantly blitzed against Utah and was able to [find Favors](https://imgur.com/43SCZbV) on multiple possessions without turning the ball over.",0.88,hot,7/25/20 15:29
748,"In 2004-2005, the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets each won road games against each other on last second buzzer-beating shots. That summer, the New York Liberty and the Houston Comets did the same exact thing. (OC)",18,hxqwzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxqwzs/in_20042005_the_new_york_knicks_and_the_houston/,3,1595728224,"16 years ago, the cosmic forces aligned two cities together in an escapable fate; to lose last second shots at home. Not only did the Knicks and Rockets exchange road buzzer beaters in the 2004-2005 season, but that fateful summer, the New York Liberty and now-defunct Houston Comets of the WNBA did the same. 

**Game 1 - New York Knicks @ Houston Rockets - November 14, 2004**

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200411180HOU.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200411180HOU.html)

The gauntlet was dropped in a nationally televised game when Jamal Crawford drained a buzzer beating game winning 3, down 2, for a 93-92 win.

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/200501210NYK.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/200501210NYK.html)

How will the Rockets respond to the Crawford Miracle? As the Knicks lead 91-90, Houston Rockets legend and savior Scott Padgett enters the game for Josh Howard with 10.2 seconds remaining only to drain a buzzer-beater jump shot to give the Rockets a 92-91 vindicating win. 

Video evidence:

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507120HOU.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507120HOU.html)

Was the balance complete with Padgett's Revenge? The battle unexpectedly raged into the summer months during a meeting of the New York Liberty and the Houston Comets. Tied at the end of regulation, Crystal Robinson knocks down one of her three 3-point field goals with 1.2 seconds to give the Liberty the 68-65 win over the Comets. Visual evidence has been lost to history, but this article recaps the events of the fateful night.

[https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507270NYL.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/boxscores/200507270NYL.html)

The dormant battle was awakened again, but how would the Comets respond in the final meeting? Perfectly balance as all should be, the game was tied at 69-69 until the final hero Michelle Snow knocked down the game winning floater to give the Houston Comets the 71-69 win, completing the saga that linked Houston and New York into an inescapable basketball time loop in 2004 through 2005.

753,[OC] Thoroughly Deconstructing How Ben Simmons' Jumpshot Horribly Regressed Between The End Of His Grade 12 Season To Now: From Fluidity to Foul,102,hxbtut,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxbtut/oc_thoroughly_deconstructing_how_ben_simmons/,43,1595660081,"**TL;DR** I LOVE LEARNING EVERYTHING I AM ABLE TO RE: SHOOTING, THEN TEACHING THIS INFO TO OTHERS

**ALSO**, if you never read my post breaking down the positive changes Kawhi made to his jumper between college and now, check it out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bswqbi/thoroughly_deconstructing_how_kawhi_leonard_has/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bswqbi/thoroughly_deconstructing_how_kawhi_leonard_has/)
_______
NOW BACK TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING:
_______
First, let's wet our whistles with a couple videos. We'll watch how Simmons shot the ball in-game and during shootaround at the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)  
And now compare that to how he shoots the ball in shootaround in this video taken during 'rona-times (peep the masks): [https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22)

**WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.**
______

During my 15 years of coaching ball, I've done a **lot** of *probably* way too in-depth studying of how to build the most efficient, simple, and fluid jumper. This eventually led me to develop the curriculum for, and coach, my own 4 day 'Shooting Camps' where a jumper is broken down to:

**Day 1** lower body  
**Day 2** upper body pre- and during-shot  
**Day 3** upper body during- and post-release of shot  
**Day 4** everything previously learned put into the overall package of a jumpshot

Okay okay okay. We're going to look at Simmons' jumper in a similar way to how these camps were structured, starting with the foundation and working our way up... We'll look at Simmons' jumper from the Nike Hoop Summit, which was at the end of his grade 12 season, and compare it to how he shoots meow.
______

**LOWER BODY**

* We see Simmons' lower body action pre-, during-, and post-shot in ""[Clip 1: ""BEN SIMMONS CAN SHOOT 3's - Evidence of Ben Simmons three point range""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg)"", from the Nike Hoop Summit in 2016, as quite consistent and close to the ideal of what you would want.

* He gathers quickly and even though it is slight, he does do a 1-2 step into the catch, allowing him to load his legs up and have them read to quickly explode up to shoot. Simmons has the lengthwise centre-line of his feet under the outside of his hipbones and the outside of each foot under each shoulder, which, IMO, is the optimal stance to find the sweet-spot between balance (and we know without proper balance in your foundation, it's going to be *hellishly* tough to shoot when moving at full-speed with defenders flying at you) and explosiveness in your jumper. You can also see he is on the balls of his feet with bouncy knees, making for great elastic energy going from his legs to his upper body when shooting the ball. Finally, his lower body is all squared to his target with his feet just *slightly* angled to the right of his target as this best brings his shooting arm's elbow to point at the basket.  

* Compared to Simmons' lower body this month in [Clip 2: 7SIXERS STAR PLAYER BEN SIMMONS SHOWS HIS LONG RANGE SHOOTING IN A PRACTICE SESSION](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22) and during this season, but pre-'rona, in [Clip 3: Pull-Up Midrange Jumper In-Game](https://youtu.be/DkqGMNhSOWU?t=102), it is all quite similar.

Hmmm the lower body may not be the problem...

* *DO NOT FORGET*: The power for shooting the ball *should* come from you lower body and shooting on the way up (a la Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II), NOT from your upper body.

**UPPER BODY**

The upper body of Ben Simmons' jumper, to quote Clive Owen in ""Inside Man"": therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.

* Simmons had, as can be seen from the [2016 Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), the ball at a high shooting pocket, with his shooting thumb above his shooting eyebrow. This was great because he could see the hoop with both eyes when the ball was up into his shooting pocket. Also, since you are lining up your shooting foot, knee, hip, elbow (his is just slightly off from lining up with the rest, but it's really not a problem), and hand straight on with your target, everything simply has to extend up and out to go straight to your target. *And* having such a high shooting pocket coupled with great height and length makes his shot extremely difficult to block.

* *HOWEVER*, now, as evidenced [here](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=22), Simmons has the ball moved over more in the centre of his head with his shooting thumb more above his opposite eyebrow. This means, as his lower body is still nicely lined up with his target and has not changed for the worse since 2016, he will be flicking more across from the centre of his head to finish his follow through lined up with his lead shooting foot. He's actually shooting across to get the ball to the hoop instead of just shooting it straight to the hoop... I believe because of this--as you can see--his shooting elbow is pointed out to his left a lot more in the recent shooting clips compared to the 2016 Nike Hoop Summit clips.  

* He *needs* to get that hand solidly lined up above his shooting eyebrow as it was [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg) and bring his elbow in. This would stop him from having this wacky fling from right to left when shooting. You'll notice most of Ben's misses are either right or left of the target... this is probably because of this right to left slingshot/catapult he is doing.

* Lastly, and another MAJOR KEY (this post has no affiliation with DJ Khaled and if any resemblance to Khaled is perceived it is completely accidental) is, when looking at [Nike Hoop Summit footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg), Simmons shot it so fluidly because he shot on the way up! It was SO fluid looking and with great timing on his release he was properly transferring all the power from his lower body to the upper body of his shot.

* BUT, looking at it meow, you can see from the [2019-20 in-season clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkqGMNhSOWU) and the [bubble shootaround](https://youtu.be/VwYNIlyyd2M?t=8) it's like you've just held the 'shoot-button' in 2k a liiiiitle too long and your MyPlayer (who looks an awful lot like Ben Simmons) has held his release until he's on the way down. What this does is cause a shooter to lose all the power from their legs--and as we mentioned previously all the power for your shot *should* come from the largest muscles of your body: your legs. Simmons is effectively only getting power from his upper body, the left-to-right fling shot motion he has developed. Probably a reason you don't generally see Simmons miss long.

*Aspiring coaches and shooters, remember this:*

* The upper body technique is what smoothly guides the ball to the centre of the hoop, whereas *power* for getting the ball to the hoop comes from the lower body in conjunction with timing your shooting release point to get the maximum power from the lower body.  
*Especially* work on using the strength of the lower body during shooting, not after you've already shot: while on your way up is the optimal time to shoot the ball as the momentum/kinetic energy from your extending lower body will fully transfer to the ball. Think about loading a spring then letting it go! That bouncy/elastic energy is what you get from properly executed lower body shooting technique. If you combine that with good upper body technique and releasing your shot on the way up, you'll then be most-efficiently transferring the energy from your legs into getting the ball to the rim.

**OVERALL**

* When you put it all together, Simmons had a fluid, efficient, and comfortable looking shot form in [2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjFKoUNJkGg). It was all one motion, and he shot on the way up.

* But now, Simmons holds his shot until he is on the way down; he has lost any fluidity he had and is losing all the power from his lower body. He relies on the current right-to-left slingshot flick he's developed. I'd love to see him rebuild, or return, to that earlier form.  

__________

I don't understand what the fuck happened. Maybe it will always be a mystery. But Ben, if you ever read this, please get back to how you shot before. It was just so damn fluid and effective.

754,Why Seth Curry can be the best low usage scorer of all time,103,hxbfye,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxbfye/why_seth_curry_can_be_the_best_low_usage_scorer/,30,1595658627,"This may like a ridiculous statement, but the stats back it up. This is NOT an overreaction to his perfect shooting performance last night, but rather a long-standing belief about my favorite player in the league.

Many people think Seth Curry is just a shooter, but this is far from the truth. Seth is one of the most versatile offensive players in the league, allowing him to take advantage of the many varied opportunities next to Luka in the Mavs flow offense. let’s look at his case as an elite low-usage scorer:

**AT THE RIM**

Seth shoots **72% at the rim** (82 percentile), which is considered elite for a guard. He is great at abusing mismatches brought by the mavs offense and creating his own shots. He’s in the 90th percentile in efficiency scoring off drives and the 75th percentile scoring in PnR. He has a lot of skill controlling the big man on the inside, having the ability to freeze the big at the rim by feinting an attack, only to hit a short fade or hit him with a deadly floater. 


**IN THE MIDRANGE**

Seth is **1st in the league in midrange fg%** (minimum 50 attempts) at **57%** on above average volume. He has one of the most accurate middy floaters in the league, and he is deadly on long 2s, shooting **56% from 16ft-3p, good for 3rd in the league**. To put it simply, he’s the best low-usage midrange player in the NBA


**FROM 3**

I know I don’t have to tell anyone this, but Seth is an all-time great shooter. He is **2nd all-time in career 3p% 44.3%** and **2nd this season in 3p% at 45.3%**. He is always ready to pull the trigger, averaging **7.1 3p attempts per 36**, and his movement off ball, as well as the defense Luka draws, creates plenty of opportunity. 

After reading about his incredible efficiency on every part of the floor, it may not surprise you that, if he had enough minutes to qualify, Seth would be **11th all-time in career ts%, right behind Reggie Miller**



**IF HE’S SO GREAT, WHY HAS HE PLAYED BACKUP MINUETS HIS WHOLE CAREER?**

Unfortunately for Seth, he is the size of a PG while having the play-style of a SG. This makes it difficult for most teams to play him with a primary playmaker without sacrificing too much size (not an issue with the Mavs, considering their PG is 6’7 and guards forwards). Seth is not a bad defender, but he isn’t nearly good enough to make up for his positional awkwardness. This, combined with the fact that he was a late bloomer and didn’t get playing time until his late 20’s, means he’s just now getting his first real shot at being an important piece. 


**IN SUMMARY**

I believe if Seth was given the full-time starting role can score 18-20 a game on fairly low usage with near league-best efficiency (as he was after being reinstated into the starting rotation midway through the season), being third scoring in scoring on a championship level team.",0.91,hot,7/24/20 23:30

756,My NBA Awards for the 2019-20 season,20,hxekxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hxekxo/my_nba_awards_for_the_201920_season/,40,1595670799,"So this is basically my award show, aka the players I think who won the award this year. And I know we still got 8 games left, and it could sway the voters a little bit, but for the most part, I feel like it is safe to say that we most likely know who the award is going to. So without further ado, let us get on with it. 

1. Sixth Man Of The Year- Dennis Schroder of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Now, this one maybe a little controversial, since a lot of you were expecting Lou Will or Montrezl Harrell to win this award, as they have put up great numbers coming off the bench. But I cannot deny the story behind OKC's success this season. Coming into the season, we did not expect OKC to be where they are, but with the help of their three-headed guard lineup of CP3. Shai, and Schroder, they have outplayed everyone's expectations. Coming off the bench, he is putting up 19.0 points on 46.8% from the field, and 38.1% from three on 5.1 attempts per game, which is the most threes he as attempted per game in his entire career, which shows that he has worked on his game in the off-season, as three point-shooting was a major problem in his career. Also, I assume voter fatigue will kick in for the voters, and after seeing the Cinderella story of OKC, and how much of a factor Schroder played in their success, I feel like he will most then likely get this award. 
2. Most Improved Player Of The Year- Bam Adebayo of the Miami Heat. At this point, it should be in debates of whether or not Bam should win the award unanimously. I mean, let me put it this way; the guy went from starting 28 of his 82 games in the 2018-19 season, averaging a mere 8.9 points and 7.3 rebounds, to the center piece of the Miami Heat on both sides of the floor, averaging 16.8 points on 56.7% from the field, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks a game. This dude literally improved in every major statistical stat, and is now considered the prototype for the modern NBA Center. The man can do it all: he can handle the rock, be a great playmaker, a strong rim runner, and be a defensive monster either on the perimeter or in the paint (his world class strength and athleticism does help in this factor as well). The only thing he needs to add in his bag is a shot, and that is coming his way. But even without it, at the young age of 22, he is considered a top 5 center, a dark horse contender for Defensive Player of the year, and might get his first spots on the all-nba and all-defensive teams. 
3. And Speaking of Defensive Player Of The Year- Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks. This was the hardest for me to vote on (yes, even harder than the MVP). I mean, you got 4 different candidates, who equally have the potential to win this award. You got the reigning DPOY winner in Rudy Gobert, who is having yet again another stellar season in anchoring the defense of the Jazz (which has kind of slipped from second to the eleventh place), averaging 13.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. We got Anthony Davis, who 9.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 2.4 blocks a game, while being the best defender on the floor for the Lakers, who have the third best defense in the league. You also got Ben Simmons, who leads the league in steals, at 2.2 steals a game, and his size gives him the ability to for real to guard positions from the 1 to the 5, as he is the most switchable and best guard defender in the league. But man, I got to keep it a buck with you (pun intended), Giannis is by far the best defender in the league. His mere 1.0 steal and 1.0 block a game may not be seen as valuable, but the man passes the eye test (and he does lead the league in most of the advanced defensive stats, when a player has played over 40 games). He has made this bucks defense one of the greatest of all time, and I cannot deny that, and so the award (according to me), rightfully goes to him.
4. Rookie Of The Year- Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies. This is almost as clear cut as the Most Improved Player Award, but with the bubble rules, this can change. You know what, nevermind, I'm still sticking with my guy Ja. The dude has been spectacular this season, and has put the Grizzlies on a good path for the future. No one expected him to take this team to the eight seed, and yet there they are. 17.6 points on 49.9% from the field, and 36.7% from three on 2.6 attempts per game, and 6.9 assists per game, which means he leads all rookies in total points and assists. Regardless of how good Zion has played since he came back to the pelicans in mid January, Ja has been ballin from the start, and I cannot deny the body of work, and how much the grizzlies have surpassed our expectations.
5. And speaking of surpassing our expectations, Coach Of The Year- Nick Nurse of the Toronto Raptors. Imagine this scenario. You are the NBA Champions, as you were lead there by the best player on your team. You expect him to return to your squad, but instead he hitches the wagon on the LA trail and heads west. You are then expected to be good, but not be contenders for trying to repeat as back-to-back champions. But then, you break all expectations and maybe in a good spot to repeat as NBA Champions. That is the Toronto Raptors this season, who are lead by an emerging star in Pascal Siakam, a good/underrated point guard in Kyle Lowry, and the defensive minded head coach in Nick Nurse. Despite losing the best two-way player in the game in Kawhi Leonard, the raptors have still managed to be a top 15 offensive team, and the second best defensive team in the league, and that is because of the good defensive scheme that is run by Coach Nurse, who for sure deserves this award. 
6. And finally, The Most Valuable Player- Lebron Ja..... Nah, I'm just playing. It has to go to the Greek Freak, aka Giannis Antetokounmpo  of the Milwaukee Bucks. Now, I know I have pissed off a lot of Lebron Stans, and they are waiting to call me a hater in the comments. But before you do so, I just want to make my points heard. Giannis is averaging 29.6 points on 54.7% from the field, and 30.6% from three on 4.8 attempts a game (which is an improvement from last year). He is also averaging 13.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists, and is the motor behind a bucks team that has a top 10 offense, and an historic defense as mentioned earlier. He is also doing this on 30.9 minutes per game, and without a co-star (not to diss Middleton. He is good. But for those of you Lebron Stans, would you rather have AD or Middleton as your co-star). He has also learned how to be a better leader, as he has improved on minute errors in his game, and is able to squeeze more wins out of his playstyle. Although Lebron has had a great comeback season, I am sorry, but I am going to have to give this one to Giannis.  

But there they are my awards. What do you guys think? Did I get them correct? Do comment down below your thoughts.",0.69,hot,7/25/20 2:53

759,Players capable of winning DPOY and MVP in the same year within the next few years,10,hx6xmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx6xmq/players_capable_of_winning_dpoy_and_mvp_in_the/,72,1595643330,"There have only been a handful of players to have won DPOY and MVP in the same year including Hakeem Olajuwon and Michael Jordan. Here are the current NBA players capable of winning both awards in the same year.

5. Joel Embiid

I wish I could put Joel higher, but availability has to count for something. Joel has missed almost 20 games every season (he was on pace to play more games this year to be fair). When it comes to an award like DPOY, we all know Embiid is capable of showing that he is one of the best defenders in the league, however, since bigs like AD and Gobert are still a slight notch above him defensively. In my opinion, Joel had an underrated season last year and was both a monster on the defensive and offensive end. His production on both ends has gotten lower this year, and obviously that can be attributed to fit, but since this Sixers team has locked this roster for the next few years I kept him here.  Assuming he doesn't get any major injuries, he has around 7 prime years to win both awards.

(I wouldn't argue if you swapped 5 and 4 as I think they are pretty close)

4. Paul George

I have Paul George so low, because he I feel like there is no way he could give an MVP and DPOY case while on the same team with Kawhi. Last year Paul George was in contention for both awards, but when it came to voting he wasn't even close to getting DPOY or MVP. PG has around 4 more prime years left: one those years will be on the Clippers, so its more like 3 years for him since I doubt he wins either award on the same team with him. If PG decides next year to go to a team where he is the main star I think it is possible for him to win DPOY in the future; however, I don't see him being able to significantly top the production he had in OKC last year and put himself above future competition like Giannis or Luka Doncic. (I know Paul George didn't play as many games this season, but has been pretty healthy for the last 4 years)

3. Kawhi Leonard

It feels odd to put Kawhi so high yet in a way so low. These are all regular season awards, and like Embiid, availability needs to count for something. Kawhi has played fewer games for the past three years. In his last real year in San Antonio he was fairly close to winning both awards in the same year, but since then he hasn't seem to give as much regard for the regular season. It is more likely that he could win another DPOY. Though he is great at creating his own shot, has developed as a passer, I have doubts he will significantly increase his offensive production to the level like Giannis, LeBron, Luka, etc.

2. Anthony Davis

Anthony Davis is on track to  finish top 4 in MVP voting and top 3 in DPOY. Considering he is the second offensive option next to LeBron, it's impressive he's this high in MVP voting. To be fair, AD has also dealt with lack of availability, but has come closer to winning MVP or DPOY than players like Embiid. Like Kawhi I think he has a better chance to win DPOY in the near future than MVP. Getting these awards will obviously depend on what he does in free agency, but assuming he resigns with the Lakers I think he would have an okay chance at winning both awards in the same year (assuming LeBron takes a step back at some point in the next few years).

1.Giannis Antetokounmpo

Giannis is already on track to win his second MVP this year and also on track to finish as the DPOY as well. Award voting will only be considering whatever games players played before suspension and Giannis has come the closest to winning both awards in the same year within recent years. So if we are talking about future seasons, unless Giannis gets injured I don't think there should be doubt that he has the highest chance of winning both awards in the same year within the next few years.",0.71,hot,7/24/20 19:15
760,The Spurs Young Guns - Dejounte Murray,16,hx4lxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hx4lxh/the_spurs_young_guns_dejounte_murray/,23,1595636015,"Hearing everyone associated with the organization repeating over and over again that these bubble games will be for the young guys got me properly fired up. We’ve waited all season to see these guys on the court together, and they didn’t waste any time getting to it. In this series of posts I’ll look at how each Spur on a rookie contract is progressing, how they performed in their first game back, and what I hope to see the rest of this bubble. 

Dejounte Murray - The head of the snake when it comes to the teams young core. It’s easy to see how much excitement the organization has had for him over the last three years and the progression of his jump shot this season showed us a glimpse of the player he could become in the coming years. 

Defense
The havoc Dejounte can cause on the defensive side of the ball was still apparent on Thursday. While that didn’t manifest itself in counting stats, the film shows how he impacts defense by blowing up actions off ball, hounding ball handlers in the pick and roll, and seemingly being in 2 places at once. He’s incredible aggressive, but nearly always finds a way to recover. While not quite the outlier he was rebounding the ball during his second season, he remains elite for his position and can truly impact the game giving the team extra possessions and pushing the break. He could be more disciplined in his rotations and attacking the glass, but in reality nothing on the defensive side of the ball gives me pause. 

Offense
On the other side of the court things are still very much a work in progress. He has always had great touch with his floater and we saw that Thursday. Multiple times he hit a little half runner/half jumper in the lane to avoid the contest from the big, and while he has become very efficient at that shots, the reason he has needed to use it so much is concerning. DJ struggled mightily to finish at the rim with the Lopez brothers and Giannis waiting in the wings. While he has very good vertical pop, he is not strong enough to explode in traffic. Too often he is eaten up by the big, who hardly even feels to the contact DJ initiates to try to get the shot off. His jumper didn’t look incredible today, but the foundation is there with his touch and improved form. The more he shoots the more comfortable he will become, and I am very high on his shooting upside considering his development arc. His passing is always an adventure. I am still not sure if he has the requisite vision needed to really drive a high level offense. He makes some really nice passes occasionally, but he hardly makes reads that show he understands the rotation the defense is going to make and how to actually maximize that advantage. He’s okay at hitting shooters in the pick and roll, but is much better hitting the roller where he can find creative angles to make the pass in a crowded space. I think he has the upside to be an All Star PG, but that is driven by his scoring ability and defensive playmaking. I think he will be best utilized in an offense with at least one other perimeter player with plus vision and creation equity if he doesn’t make a leap in that regard. 

Scrimmage Recap
The scrimmage for Dejounte really felt like an extension of the season. When he’s being aggressive attacking in PnR and in transition he can be really dangerous, but if his shot isn’t falling it can muck up his whole game. Having athletic defenders alongside him that can rotate well and cover for when he gets overeager is important, and I think the lineup with Derrick White and Lonnie Walker starting alongside him has a ton of upside. 

Looking Forward 
What I am looking for most through the rest of the bubble games from Dejounte is first improved chemistry playing with DWhite. I think he is a perfect foil for DJ (as long as Derrick actually shoots 3’s, more on that in my next post). He’s very steady in his rotations and very rarely gambles. He’s significantly sturdier than DJ and the two of them could make the best defensive backcourt in the league. DWhite also offers a little more passing vision and a steadier hand when running the offense, which helps paper over some of DJs limitations. Allowing DWhite to bring up the ball up and initiate the offense will give Dejounte more opportunity to shoot off the catch, attack close outs, and poach offensive rebounds. More specifically to Dejounte’s game, I would like to see some growth from him as a passer, using his quickness to break down the defense and punish teams for sending an extra man. With some added weight this offseason I think he’ll find ways to finish better around the basket (remember he is still coming back from a torn ACL where he got down to about 160 pounds at 6’4, so this season was always going to be tough) and I think his shooting will continue to improve. If he is going to make the leap into being the teams best player and leader moving forward a little improvement in vision and pass accuracy would go a long way.",0.94,hot,7/24/20 17:13

Everyone but Taylor Jenkins played college basketball, so this was a bit tougher to rank. For the most part I ranked them according to their college production, or if they played at a high D1 school, although there are some exceptions. The most surprising might be Jim Boylen.

763,"[OC] Post-Capela Rockets: Player production, defense, and early returns",426,hwauzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwauzp/oc_postcapela_rockets_player_production_defense/,24,1595515053,"#The ""Pocket Rockets""

After center Clint Capela was shipped out of Texas and 3&D-specialist Robert Covington was launched into Houston to create a positionless, undersized starting lineup, the Rockets have been one of the league's most unique and entertaining teams. In addition to unleashing a newly-efficient Russell Westbrook on offense with the spacing accrued via eliminating a traditional center, the Rockets' defense has become quite interesting as well, forced to defend teams sans a 7-foot rim-protector.

This is far from the first time we've seen the Rockets going small, mind you. PJ Tucker was used very often at the 5-spot in the Rockets' previous two postseason tussles against the all-conquering KD-Warriors, stretching the Dubs out with shooters and taking one of the strongest offenses ever out of their rhythm with their switching defense.

From [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-with-robert-covington-radical-rockets-are-going-small-and-thinking-big-on-defense/):

>*""With defense, we think you have to start at the perimeter and be solid there,"" (Rockets GM) Daryl Morey told USA Today's Mark Medina. ""Unfortunately, rim protection is really difficult these days with the rules that they are if a guy is getting downhill. It's very hard even if the center is back to handle that. You have to cut off penetration at the start with a strong perimeter and then get the rebound and get out and go.""*

>*You don't need rim protection if you don't let anybody near the rim in the first place. And the Rockets, with their commitment to switching and their collection of strong, quick wings, believe they have the personnel to prove it. This is a big swing. Houston ranks 15th in defensive rating, and it needs to dramatically improve to win a title. Ideally, Covington will make the Rockets' defense look like the one that jammed up the Golden State Warriors' system in the conference finals two years ago and hasn't been the same since. That team was a pain to play against. Houston switched aggressively, with smart perimeter defenders like P.J. Tucker and Trevor Ariza who understood how to kill the rhythm of a possession. The results weren't beautiful to watch, exactly -- it essentially dared the other team to go matchup-hunting and try to score in isolation -- but the execution was impressive.*

#So individually, how have players performed since Covington joined the team?

The Rockets have now played 14 games with Covington on the floor before the NBA suspended its season. Here are some player averages since Covington officially entered the side:

Name| Games played (games started), Minutes| Pts/Rbs/Ast/Stl/Blk| FG% | 3PA, 3P% | TS%, rTS% (league-average TS% = 56.4)  
---|---|----|----|----|----
James Harden| 14 (14), 35.2| **29.4**/5.9/7.5/2.0/0.6| 43.1 | 11.4, 32.5 |  60.7, +4.3
Russell Westbrook | 11 (11), 35.9| **31.7**/8.2/5.5/1.7/0.2|  **54.6** | 2.4, 38.5|  **59.3, +2.9**
Danuel House Jr.| 14 (14), 27.5| 9.1/3.6/1.7/1.1/0.4| 42.9 | 4.6, 30.8 | 56.2, -0.2 
Robert Covington *(new addition)*| 14 (13), 32.6| 12.8/7.9/1.3/1.1/**2.5**| 42.1 | **8.0, 35.7** | 56.6, +0.2 
PJ Tucker| 14 (14), 31.5 | 6.0/5.9/1.3/0.7/0.7|  42.3 | 3.9, 40.0| 58.4, +2.0 

- **Westbrook** has taken up more more scoring duties (**31.7 ppg**, up from 26.4 ppg in 41 games prior). His efficiency (**59.3 TS%**, up from 52.4 TS%) has *exploded* with the improved 5-out spacing and better shot selection (fewer 3s) allowing him to attack the rim mercilessly, feasting in open space.


- **Harden**, in return, has ramped down his own scoring load slightly (29.4 ppg, down from 35.8 ppg in 47 games prior). His efficiency and playmaking have remained largely unchanged.


- **House** has seemingly become a mainstay in this new-look lineup, with his defense, hustle, plus-rebounding for his position (4 rebs/game), decent shooting (36.3 3p% on 5.3 3pa over the season), and passable ability to make plays off double-teams. **Eric Gordon** could replace House if he regains form, as he was a full-time starter during Houston's last postseason run and was highly effective in his role (18ppg, 60ts%, 40% from 3 on 8 3pa/game, plus-defense). **Jeff Green** (10/3/1 on 41% from 3) and **DeMarre Carroll** (6/3/1 on 62 TS%), brand-new Rockets, may see some postseason playing time as well if they continue to perform well, though that's never guaranteed considering MDA's notoriously stingy playoff rotations. **Austin Rivers** and **Ben McLemore** also provide important sparks off the bench with ancillary spacing and scoring.

#Covington and Tucker's defense

The Rockets are almost guaranteed to flourish on the offensive end, with 2 of the league's best offensive guards now surrounded by ample spacing, allowing the team to create Moreyball-friendly shots at the rim and 3-point-line almost at will. 

What will determine if they do go far in the playoffs, then, will be whether their undersized **defense** can slow down playoff offenses, and **Robert Covington and PJ Tucker** are key in determining whether Houston flourishes or flames out. 

**[Covington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eog0kLAZHyI)** is an All-Defensive forward capable of rebounding (8 rebs/game) and shooting 3s at a very high volume (8.0 3pa/game), but his most important role on this team is being one of the NBA's most disruptive and impactful team defenders, both willing *and* able to switch onto bigs and provide effective weakside rim-protection (2.5 blks/game). [As Daryl Morey himself has asserted](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thats-pretty-interesting-with-robert-covington-radical-rockets-are-going-small-and-thinking-big-on-defense/), *""He's very good off the ball, knowing how to position himself, anticipate, get steals, deny passing lanes"".* On the ball, RoCo's no Kawhi but he's still a highly capable man-defender: his 7-2 wingspan and sprightly frame combined with great footwork and positioning allow him to bother anyone he's switched onto. 

**[Tucker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVoceFL96E)**, in addition to being a good outside shooter (37% from 3 on 4.3 attempts/game in last 3 seasons) and rebounder (7 rebs/game this season), is the defensive hub of this team and their do-it-all small-ball center on defense. He can switch onto any player in the league, with excellent footwork enabling him to keep up with [shifty guards](https://i.imgur.com/mXymyzg.gifv) and his strength and powerful hands allowing him to [bother bigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBVoceFL96E&t=34s) in the post - Tucker is 6-6 and 245 pounds, built like a middle linebacker. He's also very cerebral, knowing opponent tendencies and often beating players to their spots. PJ is constantly communicating with the rest of his teammates, calling out switches and consistently making smart and effective rotations of his own (he is 4th in the NBA in charges drawn). 

**When on the court together, they've been incredibly effective defensively so far.**  [According to SB Nation's Mike Prada](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2020/3/4/21163408/houston-rockets-robert-covington-p-j-tucker-defense-rim-protection), *""Houston allows teams to shoot just 59.1 percent at the basket with that combination (PJ and RoCo) in the game, according to [Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/team/11/lineups?on=739&on=3715#tab-shooting_defense_fg). That’s on par with the Lakers’ mark when Anthony Davis and JaVale McGee share the floor... 2.5 percentage points better than the 76ers surrender with Joel Embiid on the court, nearly three percentage points better than Jazz opponents shoot with Gobert on the floor.""*

So, how have they accomplished this?

Well, PJ and RoCo ""aren’t rim protectors, but they do everything a great rim protector does, along with so much more."" 

>Their lateral quickness is solid, but that’s not why they are able to stop so many different kinds of drives before they get to the rim. The reason they do is they have chests and hips of steel. To be successful at staying vertical and altering shots at the basket, one needs a strong enough chest to absorb a blow without losing balance and lowering your hands. Great perimeter defense in the anti-handcheck era is also about having a strong enough chest to absorb a blow without losing balance. Covington and Tucker, then, are essentially maintaining verticality, except further out on the floor.

>Tucker and (especially) Covington also eat up space as help defenders. Both are adept at swarming to the ball, and both do an excellent job of helping the helper so the next pass isn’t open. They ensure the weak Rockets defenders aren’t exposed in space.

>How does this make the Rockets tough to score against at the hoop when both share the floor? Consider the build of a prototypical rim protector: tall, strong, long, and able to keep those arms straight while in mid-air. Those traits seem essential because we think of big men as the type of players who can meet players at the apex of their jump. If P.J. Tuckington had to meet drivers at the apex of their jump, “he” will lose because “he” is not tall. But that’s only a problem if they actually reach the apex of their jump. By wedging their way into tight help positions and staying there due to the power of their lower body, Tucker and Covington ensure that anyone who tries to finish over them can’t in practice because they don’t have enough space to leap their highest.

>(Covington and Tucker) are each portable brick walls — or at least hand-held shields the Rockets can deploy anywhere. They allow the Rockets to string together crucial defensive possessions.

**Individually**, they're both shutdown artists: 

- PJ: harrassing and eventually denying [Kemba Walker](https://i.imgur.com/mXymyzg.gifv)  at the rim, shadowing  [Mike Conley's ](https://i.imgur.com/L0yq2Vb.gifv) drive to the rim and bothering his shot attempt, stone-walling [Daniel Theis and Gordon Hayward](https://i.imgur.com/T23fnJe.gifv).

- RoCo: picking up [Jaylen Brown](https://i.imgur.com/GPtpvFi.gifv), making himself a nuisance to [Donovan Mitchell](https://i.imgur.com/UrlpcqF.gifv), beating a spinning [LeBron James ](https://i.imgur.com/sN8zjpo.gifv) to his spot and forcing a turnover.

**Together**, they're poetry in motion, working in-sync beautifully to defend the paint and stop penetration, constantly helping the helper, plugging up gaps, and making timely and crucial rotations to keep the Rockets D humming: 

- [Denying the much-taller Gobert an opportunity to finish by crowding his space and not allowing him to use his height](https://i.imgur.com/UMewc6e.gifv)

#Early returns: Team performances

Results have been a mixed bag, with the Rockets going 8-6 in Covington's 14 games. 

**There are some impressive wins in there**: 1-point and 11-point wins vs Boston, a 10-point win vs the Lakers, and another 10-point win vs Utah. Strong offense combined with a locked-in and stingy switching defense allowed them to hold their own and prevail against some strong sides, taking numerous opponent scorers out of their rhythm (LeBron's 18 pts on 45 ts%, Tatum's 15 pts on 40 ts% and 32 pts on 48 ts%, Kemba's 14 pts on 32 ts%, Bojan 12 pts on 48 ts%).

**The losses, though**, range from more 'reasonable' ones that at least came against other playoff sides (15-point blowout loss vs Clippers, 1-point loss vs Jazz), to **a string of head-scratching upsets by below-.500 teams** (36-point massacre at the hands of the Suns, 2-point loss vs Knicks, 9-point loss vs Hornets, and a 20-point thwacking by the Magic). 

Some of this may have been a matter of size-disadvantage or Houston seemingly dialing down their effort-levels against lesser opposition and paying dearly for it: **they were out-rebounded by Phoenix 29-51, by the Knicks 34-65, and by the Magic 38-49.**

The **Clippers** didn't hold a significant rebound-advantage (57-51, shoutout to WB's 15 rebs) and Paul George had a rough offensive outing against the Rockets' switching defense (13pts on 43 ts%) but Kawhi remained as efficient as ever (25/6/5 on 66 ts%), while Clippers bigs **Zubac and Harrell both feasted** in the paint (17/12 on 98 ts% and 19/10 on 71 ts% respectively). Combined with an **extremely cold Harden shooting night** (4-17 fg, 36 ts%) and an **inefficient Westbrook one** (46ts%), it was not awfully surprising that Houston lost this game.

As for the 9-point loss to the Hornets, Westbrook missed this game. Houston actually outrebounded their opponents for once (42-30), but Harden's inefficient and relatively sloppy offensive night (53 ts% and 10 turnovers) as Houston's sole playmaker likely sealed Houston's fate, combined with white-hot shooting (67 ts%) from the entire Hornets team.


#All in all...
Houston had a +1.5 net rating in these 14 games. This is likely weighed down slightly by some of those aforementioned ugly blowout defeats (outscored by 56 points combined vs the Suns and Magic).  **Against good teams, the Rockets have been quite competitive on the whole: 4-2 record against teams w/ above .500 record, with a +2.7 net rating.** As long as they're locked-in and remain healthy, Houston absolutely have a fighter's chance of punching above their weight during the upcoming postseason run.

764,"During a 15 game stretch in 1987, the Lakers went 14-1, behind some ridiculously great point guard play out of Magic Johnson.",54,hwiwkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwiwkh/during_a_15_game_stretch_in_1987_the_lakers_went/,21,1595551006,"I was just looking at the game log for Magic in 1987, since most people agree it was the peak of his career. From mid February to mid March of 1987, the Lakers played 15 games. They won 14 of them. However, what really caught my eye was how elite Magic played during that specific stretch. 

He averaged 23.7 PTS, 16.1(!) ASTs and 7.4 TRB, on 57.5% FG. 1.5 STLs and 4.3 TOVs. 

The Lakers as a team scored 128, 121, 138, 122, 136, 143, 125, and 147 points in a game at different points during this stretch. 

Interestingly, they only scored under 100 points twice during this 15 game stretch, and both times were against the Phoenix Suns, back to back on Feb 24th and 25th. They scored 97 and 99, and won both games. 

I think when people who weren’t able to watch Magic play (like myself) see his numbers and how stacked teams were, we tend to not fully understand how good he was. He was clearly a basketball savant who is one of those players that impacted winning and rarely, if ever, had a time where he was putting up empty stats. If Magic was on that night, which was often, the Lakers were absolutely unstoppable. 

The Lakers went on to be the 1st seed in the West, and defeated the Boston Celtics in 6 games to win the NBA Championship. 

Magic won Finals MVP averaging 26-13-8 and 2.3 steals on 54% from the field, capping off possibly the best season we have ever seen out of a point guard.

Just want to give all the younger people like myself some frame of reference when they’re quick to put anyone in the same tier as Magic, he is in a league of his own!",0.86,hot,7/23/20 17:36

768,"How to make the ""draft lottery"" process better",0,hwzifr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwzifr/how_to_make_the_draft_lottery_process_better/,42,1595615972,"Hi guys,  this is my first post so apologies if there are formatting issues.  

I haven't looked through previous posts on this so apologies if someone else has voiced this.

What we do first, is remove the draft lottery process altogether, and replace it with a play in tournament for the top 4 draft picks.  This tournament can run in line with the NBA playoffs but it doesn't have to, if it's deemed to be too much basketball. For those picks that are 5 to 14 (lottery picks) these are then determined based on your NBA record.

The traditionally projected top two teams get a bye into the second round in order to make the bracket fill out.  If there is an expansion of 2 teams into the league you may wish to give the 2 teams, the top 2 picks going into the next 2 or 3 seasons and then following the introductory period to the league, the new teams would be required to enter the now 16 team bracket.  During the introductory period the 2 new teams would play each other for the first overall pick, in a best of three series

What this always for is the league expansion teams giving opportunities to Gleague, free agency, street ball players, to show their skills and potentially get semi pro/professional minutes.

The brackets would be organised in such a way that the teams with the lesser NBA record would have top seeds and they would play the team that would traditionally be expected to have the last pick in the lottery.  The brackets are not sorted by conference but by NBA ranking.

Obviously, this would lead to many expecting the 14th ranked team (the best of the teams to not make the NBA playoffs) so to remove this, we take the point difference  between starting fives during the season as a points handicap per game.  Each series is a best of 5 series with the final being best of 7 series.

It works in the trade market although I do need some ideas to make this better.  I will acknowledge that this is a little convoluted  but hear me out.

This could be introduced during the next CBA or if you're wanting to start on an even playing field, introduce it when the currently traded draft picks are finally selected.

Examples

If the 2nd seed pick belonging to  team A in the tournament is traded to team B that is also in the tournament,  then team B gains the 2nd seed along with their own pick seed.   

If the 2nd seed pick belonging to team A in the tournament is traded to team C  that has made the NBA playoffs, then team C enters the draft pick tournament (as the 14th pick, measured by NBA record if there are multiple team C in that years draft selection).  Team C also remain in the NBA playoffs.   Because Team C are in two tournaments they must nominate a squad for playoffs and another for the tournament.   Those in the playoff squad can only play in the draft pick tournament if they haven't played a professional game in 2 weeks due to injury.    Those who were nominated as the draft pick tournament squad would be permitted to play in the nba playoff tournament if there is an injury to a playoff played

In this circumstance, Team C can now allow for opportunities for gleague players, free agency players, street ballers, the opportunity to try to gain contracts by having the draft pic tournament on TV.

It also gives Assistant coaches the opportunity to act as Head coaches during the draft pick tournament, if both tournaments are at the same time.",0.5,hot,7/24/20 11:39
769,Players who can have their Jersey Retired on 3 Different Teams,27,hwiv8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwiv8y/players_who_can_have_their_jersey_retired_on_3/,59,1595550891,"The only player to get their jersey retired on three teams was Wilt Chamberlein. This shows how much free agency has changed throughout NBA history and how players are in search of a better situation at that moment and more prone to leave. All of these players are entering/still in/just leaving their prime

3. Kawhi Leonard

I have Kawhi higher on this list simply because we don’t know if Toronto, and possibly San Antonio, will retire his jersey. In San Antonio he did create a big fuss and demanded a trade: He was there for only a handful of years and set the franchise back when he left. However, he did win a Championship and DPOY twice with them. I personally believe he has done enough to get his jersey retired there, but there still may be some unknown tension between him and the franchise. Toronto is also somewhat iffy since he came in, won, then dipped. This was their first championship ever though, and it wouldn't have been possible without him, so I think there should be a decent chance Toronto retires his jersey. If Kawhi does win a chip as a Clipper, and possibly shows commitment by signing for and extended deal, I think he has a good chance of having his jersey retired by the Clippers too.

2. Kevin Durant:

Kevin Durant is already a lock for OKC, even if most OKC fans still hate him. 4 scoring titles and a championship run should be enough. Especially after 9 seasons with the franchise and being close to the player to play for OKC right next to Westbrook, KD deserves to have his jersey retired by OKC. I understand he didn't leave OKC on the best of terms, but just by how long he was there and how he gave the franchise some of its best seasons it has ever had he should be considered. Additionally, he did fulfill his contract and didn't force a trade that would have resulted in OKC probably getting a worse player than him. Golden state had already announced they are going to retire his jersey after his achilles tear. Now if KD can recover to at least 70% of what he once was he’ll make noise. The east is strong, but the Nets could have a good chance of making the finals if they perhaps add another piece. If KD were to win a championship or even have a fair amount of strong seasons with the team (more than 4 seasons), that drastically would increase his chances of getting his jersey retired by the Nets.

1. LeBron James

LeBron had some of his best prime years with the Heat. He won 2 MVPS and 2 FMVPS with them. He was a crucial part in them winning, and will probably have his jersey retired there. For the Lakers, LeBron will have to win a championship or at least pick up an MVP. The Lakers have elite company among those who have had their jersey retired by the team. I feel like it should be very possible for LeBron to have his jersey retired by the Lakers simply, because we know the Lakers (assuming AD resigns) are and will be strong contenders for a couple years, and during that time I could easily see LeBron win a championship

Lastly, for Cleveland it’s up in the air. Sure LeBron had a couple good years there and won a championship, but I think he may be overshadowed by the legacy of Matthew Dellavadova. Delly was superior LeBron in almost every facet of the game during LeBron's second tenure in Clevland. I think LeBron has an okay chance of getting his number retired by the Cavs, but only if the media can shift their view from true greatness to LeBron",0.82,hot,7/23/20 17:34
770,What's Next For The Atlanta Hawks? Part 3: Free Agency [OC],29,hwhwal,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwhwal/whats_next_for_the_atlanta_hawks_part_3_free/,11,1595547790,"This upcoming offseason the Atlanta Hawks are in a prime position to make a major acquisition through free agency. Their 48.4 million dollars in cap space is the most in the league and puts the Hawks in an interesting predicament. Do they want to commit big money to a high-end free agent or would they rather spend their money on role players on short term contracts? Today we will be looking at free agents that the Hawks should be looking to target in this upcoming offseason. We will separate these free agents into separate tiers (low-tier, mid-tier, and high-tier) based upon the predicted impact of said free agent. Without further adieu, let’s talk some Hawks.

Low-Tier Free Agents:

Micheal Kidd-Gilchrist:

MKG just had the worst season of his underwhelming career this last season. He struggled to stay on the court and even when healthy he had a hard time finding himself minutes on a middling Hornets team and a surging Maverick squad. MKG has offered little on offense in his career but the one thing he has always been solid at is defending. MKG could bring some much-needed perimeter and interior defense to this Hawks squad that ranked 26th in defensive rating this past year. MKG, in limited minutes, could bolster the Hawks defense as he could effectively defend opposing wings on the perimeter and offer a solid defensive presence on the interior. Now he’s not going to be doing much on the offensive end but the Hawks wouldn’t really need him to. MKG would serve as a rim roller and lob threat, no more. He could also set some screens and grab some boards but his offense is very limited. Let’s not even talk about that fugly jump shot (like seriously ew, that shit nasty). The Hawks could probably get MKG on a minimum contract considering he didn’t exactly torch the league this past season, putting up whopping averages of 2.5 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 0.6 assists. On a minimum contract, it’s a very low-risk deal and in my opinion, it’s a risk worth taking.

Torrey Craig:

Over the last two seasons, Torrey Craig has been a piece of some very strong defensive in Denver. He’s shown to be a very strong perimeter defender, occasionally locking down the opposing team's twos and threes and, at very least, making their life a bit more difficult. He’s the type of player to bring energy to the defense off the bench and make winning plays on that end. His 6’7 frame limits what he can do defensively against big men, but he does a good job of closing down passing lanes and providing help defense on the interior.

Craig’s no phenom on offense but he’s not an absolute zero. His shooting is a bit underwhelming, but he can definitely hit an open three (33% from three this season). He’s athletic enough to get to the basket on occasion, where he shoots a very respectable 71.4%. He is ineffective from the midrange, but luckily for his team, he’s not one to launch up a ton of dumb shots. His playmaking is underwhelming at best, however, he will not kill his team with a barrage of turnovers. Ultimately Craig is a smart, hardworking, hustler that could provide a quality defense and shooting on the court while also acting as a leader in the locker room. Craig is a restricted free agent this summer so the Hawks would need to be willing to outbid the Nuggets. I think the Hawks could get Craig at something like a two-year, 12-13 million dollar deal. If they can get him in that price range, I'd like to see Craig on the Hawks. 

Nerlens Noel:

If the Hawks are looking to upgrade at the backup five-position Nerlens Noel might just be their guy. Nerlens has had an up and down career up to this point but he seems to have finally found his footing in OKC. This season, Noel put up a mega efficient 7.7 point, 4.9 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1.5 blocks in just 18.4 minutes a game. On offense, Noel is your typical rim roller. He runs the pick and roll, finishes at the basket, and occasionally catches lobs. Noel is a serviceable post player, whipping out a fade away or hook shot every now and then. Over the years Noel has expanded his game to the midrange where he’s been semi-effective (shooting 33.3% between 15-19ft). Noel isn’t a playmaker but he is a smart passer. He’s good at getting the ball to players who then carry out a play. He does turn over the ball a bit more than you’d like but it’s not a serious problem. Let’s move on to his bread and butter, his defense.

Defense has been the one constant thing Noel has had going for him in his NBA career. He’s always been a good interior defender who’s more than capable of swatting shots right back at where they came from. Noel’s got the body to be a great NBA defender as he’s 6’10 and 220lbs however it’s his defensive IQ that really makes him what he is on defense. Noel is a great help defender, always covering his teammate's weak side and being in the position to contest shots. He’s an adept reader of passing lanes and is always ready to pounce on a misplaced place, it shows in his stats as well as he grabs a steal in just over 18 minutes a game. His perimeter defense is suspect, but at the center position, that is less essential. Noel is a strong rebounder, notching 4.9 rebounds a game, and an impressive 1.5 offensive rebounds a game for the Thunder. Out of all the cheaper options, Nerlens is probably my favorite for the Hawks. He’d be a very nice defensive piece off the bench, acting as a sort of unconventional sixth man. Noel could thrive next to a passer like Trae Young and really grow along with this team as he’s still only 25 years old. Noel will probably be looking for a longer-term deal with more guaranteed money but if the Hawks are willing to pay up he could be a very nice piece for them. 

Avery Bradley:

I know what you’re thinking, would Bradley really leave the Lakers to play for this young, inexperienced Hawks team. If the paycheck was large enough I think he would. Bradley has been a very solid player for the Lakers and I'm sure they’d like to retain him but I believe that if the Hawks wanted him bad enough they could get him. Bradley has always been a high-level defender and he would certainly bring experience and leadership on that end for the Hawks. Due to his elite perimeter defense, Bradley would take on the hardest defensive assignment between the two guards and help hide Trae’s piss poor defense. He could also net the Hawks some more steals with his excellent off-ball defense, leading to more transition opportunities for the team.

On offense, Bradley would act mainly as a spot-up shooter (similar to what he’s doing in L.A.). Bradley’s been a strong shooter for most of his career, which is good because you can never have too much shooting. Bradley won’t be out their making pinpoint passes or breaking ankles but he doesn’t need to. He is the epitome of a 3&D player. Nothing more, nothing less. 

Middle Tier Free Agents:

Kris Dunn: 

Kris Dunn has become a pretty underrated player in today's game. His lack of scoring ability has made him go under the radar for all the other things he can do on the court for you. Dunn has made a name for himself on the defensive end where he’s legitimately an all-defensive level player. I know counting stats don’t really paint a good picture of how good a player is defensively but let's just take a look real quick. In just 24 minutes a game Dunn snagged himself two steals a game (nearly three steals a game per 36). That’s super impressive and really highlights Dunn’s ability to read passing lanes and use his athleticism to capitalize on misplaced passes. Dunn would provide what Bradley does on defense except it would be like Bradley on crack cocaine. Dunn is a superior athlete compared to Bradley and at this point in his career a better lockdown defender. Dunn could clamp down on both point guards and shooting guard while still holding his own against some of the smaller wings. Dunn would be a perfect fit defensively next to Trae. He could take on the harder defensive assignment between the two and even use his defensive IQ to back up Trae when he needs it. 

Offensively Dunn, as I stated, is a bit limited. He can finish at the basket as he’s shooting roughly 64% on shots within five feet of the basket. But other than that his shooting is pretty atrocious, especially for a guard. He shoots below average from pretty much everywhere else on the court. His midrange stats are pretty gross and his three-point shooting is no better. The good thing is that Dunn doesn’t force up a ton of shots he's not good at. For instance, he only shot two threes a game this season. Luckily Dunn is a damn good passer who’s definitely capable of acting as a secondary playmaker. Dunn constantly makes smart passes, getting the ball to open shooters and cutters. He’s simply good at initiating the offense and getting the ball where it needs to go. In transition Dunn can be both a finisher and initiator, making well-aimed passes if he gets overwhelmed on his way to the basket. His fit next to Trae is excellent, he can help initiate the defense, allowing Trae to play off-ball while also covering for Trae’s lack of defense. When you take into account his age (25) it becomes even more clear how seamless a fit Dunn would be on the Hawks.

Paul Millsap:

How about a reunion! Millsap spent four excellent years in Atlanta where he made a name for himself by being a gritty defender and leader. Millsap has been a winning player his whole career and at the age of 34, that is yet to change. He’d bring some much-needed experience to the locker room. Millsap could really help the Hawks on defense where he would bolster their interior defense tremendously. Millsap would be able to use his size, strength, and length to keep the opposition from reaching the basket. His help defense would also pay major dividends for the Hawks as he could help make up for some of Capela’s and Collin’s shortcomings on that end. Millsap is also a useful perimeter defender as he’s quick enough to keep up with a majority of wings despite being on the older side. More than anything Millsap would give the Hawks defense a leader and a consistent defensive presence. He could help teach some of the young Hawks to learn defense and show bigs like Collins how to better perceive the game on that end of the floor. 

Millsap would also act as a solid offensive edition to the Hawks. Over the last seven years, Millsap has developed a pretty reliable jump shot. This development of his jumper has really shown out this last season where he shot a career-high three-point percentage (44%) on 2.5 threes a game. In fact, 25.6% of his shots came from catch and shoot situations from three. He’s also become quite proficient at making shots from the midrange, especially fadeaways. This season Millsap shot an impressive 50% from between 10-14ft away from the basket. At the basket, Millsap is a proficient finisher and low post player. Millsap uses his hulk-like strength to back down defenders and push past said defenders for put backs. He’s also quite a skilled post player, using a wide range of fakes, fades, and hook shots to get buckets. He’s a pretty skilled rebounder, he’ll use his strength to outcompete the opposition for rebounders. He’s also good at positioning himself for rebounds and boxing out players for the rebound. Playmaking isn’t really Millsaps thing. He’s not a bad passer, just a bad playmaker. He makes good decisions with the ball but he often misses open teammates due to a simple lack of vision. It’s all good though if you were the Hawks you really wouldn’t want the ball to be taken out of Trae’s hands anyway. Millsap would be an awesome addition to the Hawks, however, it might be tricky finding him enough playing time considering he’d have to split time with John Collins. But if they could make it work Millsap would definitely help the Hawks win more games. It’s just whether or not they’d be willing to play Millsap over some of their young players (mainly John Collins). Getting Millsap would be the type of move that would really highlight the direction of the Hawks. Are they going all-in on making the Hawks good now or are they going to take it slow? I guess we will have to see. 

Derrick Favors: 

Don’t let the stats fool you. Derrick Favors is a very good player. Whereas some players make their mark on the offensive end Favors has always been a defender first. He’s an absolute force on the interior, making opposing ball handlers second guess their decision to visit the paint. He’s a more than capable shot blocker, notching 1.3 blocks a game for his career. He’s not the type to be back down by other bigs either as he’s built like a fucking bulldozer (like holy fuck bud). He makes life hard for the opposition in the interior but how does he fare on the perimeter? Not great, he’s a bit slow on his feet so keeping up with guards and quicker wings is a bit of a problem for Favors. He’s better suited staying in the paint where he has less ground to traverse and he can focus on bodying everybody. Favors is also a great rebounder. This past season he grabbed 9.9 rebounds and 3.3 offensive boards. This was in large part because of his elite positioning as well as his ability slither around box-outs to get to the ball. 

Favors is mainly an interior scorer. He’s very reminiscent of the bigs of the NBA's past, using a variety of post moves to finesse his way to points. He also uses his size to his advantage finishing through heavy contests/contact. Said size is also used to push around defenders in the post, putting Favors in prime position for a dunk or put back. He’s also a quality roller to the basket, which would be great to have off the bench (assuming they don’t start him over Collins or Capela). Favors rarely shoot threes, however, he’s not opposed to shooting the occasional mid-range shot. He’s shown to be a decent shooter from within 14ft so there's that. But overall he’s a subpar shooter. Favors helps his teammates by setting hard screens, allowing his teammates to make plays, and get shots off. I’d love to see Favors on the Hawks. He’s the type of selfless, defensive anchor the Hawks need to take a step forward. Back in Utah, he came off the bench for multiple years with little fuss, which is a great sign that he would probably not start for the Hawks. Rather he would act as a sort of defensive based sixth man. In my opinion, the Hawks should favor Favors in free agency (god that was a shitty pun).

High Tier Free Agents:

Otto Porter:

The last two seasons haven’t been the kindest to Otto Porter. He went from being stuck in a reportedly toxic locker room in Washington and then was shipped to Chicago to play on the bottom-feeding Bulls. This last season Porter really struggled to stay healthy, leading to limited success on the court. When healthy Porter has been a very solid player, putting up 14.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2 assists on 50/44/83 shooting splits. He was a damn good offensive player, well suited to play as a third option. Porter is already a good shooter but he could really be optimized playing next to a transcendent player like Trae Young. He could spot in the corner for more threes. Porter would also benefit from being next to Trae as he would get more opportunities to act as the roll man in the pick and roll, where Otto has been quite effective (66.5% shooting within five feet of the basket in his last full season in Washington). Porter would add another shot creator to the Hawks lineup as he’s more than willing and capable of shooting from the midrange (55% 2017-2018 season) and from deep (44.1% on 4.1 threes a game). Porter uses his lateral quickness to dash by defenders and cut to the basket. He’s also become pretty solid at creating his own shot from outside, using fakes and hesitations to throw off the defenders timing and get the shot off. Despite Otto only averaging 1.5 assists for his career I’d argue that he’s actually a pretty effective passer. He’s shown to be an effective passer in the pick and roll, swiftly identifying the open cutter and nail him (pause) with a bullseye pass. In transition Otto is nothing special, he’s more than capable of finishing at the basket but he doesn’t have the Fox-like speed to be a premier threat in the full court. 

Defensively Porter is pretty solid. He’s not going to be getting an all-defensive team selection anytime soon but he’s no slouch either. Porter is quick on his feet, which allows him to keep up with a vast array of wings on the perimeter. He’s really effective at staying in front of his man and contesting shots at the basket. His interior defense is limited due to his lack of size and strength but he’s not a complete pushover. He’s long enough to make guards live hard at the basket but has a hard time not getting overpowered by big men. Porter would add another layer to both the Hawks defense and offense. He’d thrive as the third-option next to Young and Collins, getting plenty of open looks from three, the midrange, and at the basket. If Porter can stay healthy and go back to being the player he was back in the 2017-2018 season, he could be quite the pickup for the Hawks.

Bogdan Bogdanovic: 

Bogdan is coming off a career year in which he took the starting spot away from sharpshooter Buddy Hield. Bogdan was simply a more versatile player than Heild, both as a defender and scorer. He can score from anywhere on the court, making his own offense with finesse and skill. He shot 43.3% from the field, 36.1% from three on 7.2 attempts a game, and a career-low 72.4% from the line this last season (which is an outlier for his career). So yeah… he’s a damn good shooter. His playmaking is also pretty strong. He didn’t get to flash it a ton this season since Fox was deservingly the lead ball-handler and playmaker for the Kings but Bogdan is more than capable of leading an offense. He makes smart passes, finding open cutters and shooters. He’s the type of player that doesn’t make a ton of stupid decisions with the ball, which is valuable in itself. He’d also be a nice transition threat for the Hawks, both as a passer or finisher. His biggest contribution to the Hawks would lie in his shot creation ability as he’s quick enough and skilled enough as a ball-handler to get and make shots on his own. On offense, Bogdan would be a seamless fit next to the team's other young players.

Now onto the defense. Bogdan is by no means a terrible defender. He’s a decent perimeter defender who uses his quickness to stay in front of opposing guards. He’s not a very active off-ball defender however, he lacks spatial awareness at times. He’s not a particularly great help defender either since he sometimes struggles to read the floor. Like most guards, his defense on the interior is lacking. He can guard other guards but the second you put a big man on him in the post he’s fried chicken. He just simply isn’t big enough or strong enough to hang with 4’s and 5’s of the NBA. He is okay to slightly above average defender overall but if you're acquiring him you're doing it for what he brings on the offensive side of the ball. His fit on the Hawks is a bit more questionable than some of the other players we have listed as you’d ideally want an elite defender next to Trae at the other guard position but his offensive fit could be seamless. He could take up secondary ball-handling and playmaking opportunities, allowing Trea to play off-ball more. He could also lead the second unit at the point when Trae is sitting on the bench. That way they would always have a high-level playmaker in the game. It would certainly be a win-now move to pay big money for Bogdan. But if the Hawks are focused on winning now they should be prepared to pay a king's ransom as it will be hard to pry him away from Sacramento. 

Danilo Gallinari:

This would be the Hawks going all-in on offense. Gallo’s a straight-up bucket and he’d definitely bring some more shot creation to the lineup. His ability to hit from anywhere on the court would alleviate some of the scoring burden off of Trae shoulders and allow him to focus a bit more on facilitating the ball. Gallo would give them another player to give the ball in crunch time as he’s more than capable of making his own shot. He’s more than capable of getting you a bucket in the post as well, which could allow Collins to get more spot-up attempts from outside. Gallo wouldn’t fill the team's need for a secondary playmaker but his scoring would be more than enough to make up for it. Plus you don’t really want to take the ball out of Trae's hands unless you have to. 

Gallo’s a notably shaky defender compared to others on this list. He can provide serviceable defense on the interior, where he uses his length to block off areas and contest shots. Unfortunately, Gallo is pretty shitty as a perimeter defender. His lack of athleticism leads to players being able to blow by him with relative ease. I mean he’s not a traffic cone on that end of the floor. He has some ability to read the offense and position himself, but the overall defense just isn’t his forte. Of all the players we’ve spoken of so far, Gallo might just be the best out of all of them. He also might be the worst fit for the Hawks. True, his shot creation would alleviate the scoring burden that both Trae and Collins take on but his defense would undoubtedly hurt the team. You would be adding a subpar defender to one of the worst defenses in the league...no thanks. His age would also be an issue as he’s 31 years old. Gallo is a very good player, but I don’t think he’s the right player to put next to this young, burgeoning core.

Gordon Hayward:

Hayward doesn’t get enough love. After a gruesome leg injury a few years back many people wondered if he’d ever be the same player he once was. He’s yet to reach the highs that he did back in Utah but he’s still managed to be a high-impact player despite his setbacks. This year as the fourth option on a supremely talented Celtics team Hayward put up an impressive 17.2 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 4 assists on all-around efficient shooting. That was as a fourth option! Sure Hayward may never be quite the same as he was in Utah but he’s still a really fucking good player. The stats back it up too, this season the Celtics net rating was +6.2 with Hayward playing. He’s another one of those all-around scorers, able to drive to the basket, hit from midrange, and snipe from deep. This shooting mixed with his high-level ball-handling skills make him a threat at all times as he could just as easily cut to the basket as he could pull up from deep. He could also take on that secondary playmaking role we’ve been talking about as Gordon is an above-average facilitator. He’s especially good at finding cutters to the basket and working as a passer in the pick and roll. Skills that would very much so come in handy next to Collins and Capela. 

How’s the defensive fit next to the rest of the Hawks? Well, Hayward is just alright on defense. His perimeter defense is solid, he can keep up with most wings. If he lets a ball-handler slip by him Hayward has the burst to chase his man down and still get up to contest the shot. His man to man defense is strong but his off-ball defense could use some work. He can be inconsistent on that end, which is problematic as Atlanta needs a consistent defensive presence, someone they can really rely on. His interior defense, as a whole, is underwhelming. He’s not as tall or heavy as some other wings, leading him to getting bodied in the post more often than not. Despite some of his defensive flaws I like the idea of the Hawks picking up Gordon Hayward (assuming he doesn’t pick up his player option). He’d slide right into the Hawks lineup as a shot creator and playmaker while not hurting them on defense. His game would add another dimension to the Hawks offense, a dimension that might just get the Hawks to the playoffs.

Side Note: I didn’t include Brandon Ingram on the list because I don’t see any way the Pelicans don’t match any offer that is given to him.

771,[OC] Jamal Murray Has Time on His Side,52,hwduhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwduhu/oc_jamal_murray_has_time_on_his_side/,14,1595531719,"With every fresh bout of inconsistent play, it feels like a few more people give up on the idea of Jamal Murray ever being the perennial All-Star many pegged him to be after his first season with Denver Nuggets. And to be fair, as the 2019-20 season stumbles into (maybe) the post-season, Murray is yet to feature – or even warrant much consideration – for that particular honour. However, those outside the Nuggets fanbase (who are kind of obligated to believe in Murray considering the 5yr/$170 Million contract the organisation signed him to) shouldn’t dump all their stock just yet. 

As has already been detailed by many, Murray can be an incredibly frustrating player to watch. On the one hand, there are games like the one he had himself against Memphis early in the season, where he posted a 39/8/4 stat line to go along with 3 steals, 7 made 3-pointers (on 12 3PA), and a +23 NetRtg. And then on the other, there are games like the one he had against Golden State just before the league-wide shut down, where he posted a 14/3/6 line while shooting 3/14 from the field and 0/6 from 3. And although every player goes through highs and lows – especially when said players are high-volume shooters who play the point – few are as volatile while Murray and less warrant his level of interest from the national media. 

All that being said, Murray is still young, and inconsistency comes with the territory. And all one has to do to remind themselves (and others) of just how much room a player like Murray has to grow is to study the past seasons of similar, yet more-established point guards. 

Below is a per game and advanced stats comparison of Murray and 4 guards that fit the above mould:

Player A (22yrs/4th season): 36.4 MP, 21.7 PTS, 5.2 AST, 1.5 STL, 1.9 TOV on 47/42/85 splits

Player B (22yrs/1st season): 38.6 MP, 19.0 PTS, 6.5 AST, 0.9 STL, 2.1 TOV on 43/37/84 splits

Player C (22yrs/2nd season): 33.6 MP, 18.6 PTS, 5.8 AST, 1.5 STL, 3.1 TOV on 48/44/93 splits 

Player D (22yrs/4th season): 32.8 MP, 18.8 PTS, 4.8 AST, 1.2 STL, 2.3 TOV on 46/35/89 splits

Player E (22yrs/2nd season): 34.9 MP, 17.7 PTS, 5.7 AST, 2.0 STL, 2.4 TOV on 42/32/80 splits

Per:

1. Player A
2. Player C
3. Player E
4. Player D
5. Player B

3. Player D

3. Player E
4. Player D
5. Player B

VORP:

1. Player A
2. Player C
3. Player E
4. Player B
5. Player D

	Of the above: one is a two-time MVP, another played his age-22 season alongside perhaps the greatest player in history, and two others are both multi-time All-Stars each with at least one All-NBA nod. The other: Jamal Murray. 

Now, none of this to say that Jamal Murray will ever win an MVP award, make an All-NBA team, or even make an All-Star appearance (although for the record my money would be on no, yes, and multiple respectively). But rather, this post should serve only as a reminder that Murray (and other young players like him) should always be discussed in the proper context. Murray is young. He’s relatively inexperienced. He plays the hardest spot on the floor to master. **And he is the only point guard in the NBA who has to defer primary playmaking responsibilities to a seven-footer**. 

Sure, Murray is not the player we want him to be right now, but does that mean he’ll never be? Only time will tell. 

For reference:

Player A: Kyrie Irving
Player B: Stephen Curry
Player C: Damian Lillard
Player D: Jamal Murray
Player E: Kemba Walker",0.9,hot,7/23/20 12:15

Looking at Luka's holistic performance over the season I'd say he's overrated.

* Already has a supporting cast many stars in bad situations would dream of. So many shooters and lob catchers. Perfectly suited for both the modern NBA and Luka's game. 

* Mavericks do well without him in comparison to other superstars who drive their offense.

* I don't think he'll become a good shooter like many are expecting. His FT% (75%) is average. He shoots 32% on threes because he attempts Harden-level difficulty shots without Harden-level shooting. 

* Wasn't clutch this year due to aforementioned three bricking in crunch time. But he was clutch in his rookie year so who knows. 

* Stat stuffing is due to high usage and almost always handling the ball + initiating plays when on the floor. 

**The case for underrated**

This boils down to one thing: he might not have been healthy. 

* He started off the season AMAZING. Leading the league in WS/48, BPM, VORP. 

* Apparently he sustained injuries at some point? And was playing through them. While still good, his numbers dropped. 

* So, Luka might lowkey be the best player in the league already who could average an efficient 30 point trible double when completely healthy. 

**The case for properly rated**

He's usually rated 5th among healthy players this season. Honestly I don't really have a case that he should be exactly here. I think he should either be closer to first, or rated lower with players like AD, Jokic, Dame, Embiid ahead of him. What do you think?",0.66,hot,7/23/20 18:23

&#x200B;

 

Caruso was prepared to pay for private flights from Orlando to Austin and back, he said. He would leave after the Lakers' practice on July 17 -- the day before the wedding. He contemplated attending the ceremony, which was outdoors, and skipping the indoor reception. He looked into finding a ""safe house"" in the Austin area where he might be able to sleep after leaving the ceremony, but finding one on short notice proved impossible.

Last Thursday, two days before the wedding, he made his decision and texted his family: he would skip it. He had friends record ""basically the whole event"" and send him video, he said. Caruso spent his downtime over the weekend watching the footage in his room.

""There were some people that should have had masks on that didn't,"" Caruso said of the wedding. ""I would say 75% of the people had them on. Texas and Florida -- they can kind of be their own countries at times. Some people just like to do their own thing.""

He could not FaceTime into the wedding live because the reception was not good enough, he said. Caruso is sad, but at peace with his choice.

""If I was on a team that didn't have title aspirations -- a team trying to hold onto the No. 8 seed or something -- it might have been different,"" Caruso said. ""But we have worked too hard.""",0.96,hot,7/22/20 4:06

A bunch of discussion in the comments of the more recent post was about SMOY candidates basically playing starter-level minutes. Some comments proposed setting a minutes limit, while others proposed not being allowed to be in the top 5 in minutes played per game on their own team. The second one intrigued me and so I went to work.

I'd already gotten the Basketball-Reference stats for another project. I decided to use VORP (value over replacement player) as my criteria, as it *seems* to be the best all-in-one stat.

776,Most MVP votes for players who never won MVP in the last 20 years,267,hvxfs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvxfs6/most_mvp_votes_for_players_who_never_won_mvp_in/,130,1595465863,"Looking back, there were so many great players who never won MVP. Even many who were so close to winning the MVP, or those that were just ""in the conversation"" a lot, but never got close.

So i devised a very simple formula to see who these people were. 

* Take the voting for players who have never won an MVP
* Divide by the maximum votes (since the scoring system fluctuates year to year) that year to devise a ""Almost-MVP score""
* Add it all up; simple as that, to get their ""Total Almost-MVP Score""

Do note that because I only went up to the last 20 years (could go further if I had time), some players who crossed the 90's into the 2000's were likely misrepresented just a little in the data in terms of how they impacted MVP races. Most notably Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, Reggie miller etc.

I won't post the detailed year-by-year results in this thread, but you can find everything [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CtarP_npuCJqAxK-j43167yazK-8TMB1AXWlF4RrRRE/edit?usp=sharing).

Onto the top 20:

|Player|Total Almost-MVP Score|
|:-|:-|
|1. Chris Paul|163.9|
|2. Dwight Howard|124.9|
|3. Kawhi Leonard|99.2|
|4. Tracy McGrady|85.5|
|5. Dwyane Wade|79.3|
|6. Jason Kidd|78.7|
|7. Anthony Davis|59.9|
|8. Chris Webber|54.5|
|9. Carmelo Anthony|45.3|
|10. Jermaine O'Neal|42.5|

Some observations about the top 10:

* This methodology generally skews towards one of two groups; people who were top 3 MVP voting in close races, or people who received MVP voting a lot. 
* Chris Paul is one of the rare cases where its both. In 14 seasons he received MVP voting in a whopping 8 different years (tied first with Wade), and will undoubtedly get some points this year as well. That combined with a 2nd place finish in 08, 3rd in 2012 and 4th in 2013 puts him deservedly at the top of the list
* Dwight was definitely the one that burned the brightest, only receiving votes in 5 years, but in those 5 years he was top 5 voting in 4, including a 2nd place finish
* Similarly, Kawhi only received votes in 4 years, but has a 2nd and 3rd place finish; lets assume in a few years he probably gets a lot more.
* McGrady also had 2 strong finishes, though I must say got a ton of votes even on those mediocre Magic teams
* Kidd is mostly on the list due to his 2nd place finish against Tim Duncan, though since we aren't including the 90's he likely has much more
* Wade only had 1 big vote year, though got votes in 8 seasons.
* AD, Melo, Webber and Jermaine Oneal make the top 10 due to one high finish. 

Stray Observations

* A total of 73 players who have never won MVP have received at least 1 MVP vote in the last 20 years
* Of those, 17 players have received exactly one 5th place MVP vote. They are (from most recent) Klay Thompson, Mike Conley, Ty Lawson, David Lee, Stephen Jackson, Antawn Jamison, Rasheed Wallace, PJ Brown, Marcus Camby, Michael Redd, Jamal Mashburn, Mike Bibby, Anthony Mason, John Stockton, Darrell Armstrong, Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose (the last 2 in the same year while both on the Pacers).
* Marcus Camby, PJ Brown and Darrell Armstrong all received a vote despite never having made an all-star team. Though each had their own hardware (and were better than Jamal Mashburn)
* In addition to those 17, 11 players also received votes only once: Andrei Kirilenko, Sam Cassell, Brandon Roy, Goran Dragic, Al Jefferson, Kyle Lowry, Draymond Green, John Wall, Isaiah Thomas, Victor Oladipo and Jimmy Butler
* Of the players who only received votes once, Isaiah Thomas has far and away the most points (8) with a fifth place finish. 
* Of the players who only received votes twice, Paul George and Joakim Noah are way ahead of everyone else.
* Tony Parker got votes in 7 years, but finished outside the top 5 in voting in 6 of those years
* Players most likely to move way up on this list in a decades time (if they don't win an MVP) will be Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Damian Lillard, Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokic
* The most votes without ever receiving a top 5 finish in multiple years are Paul Pierce (4.1 in 5 years), Amare Stoudemire (6.3 in 4 years), Ben Wallace, (6.63 in 3 years), Vince Carter (5 in 3 years) and Lamarcus Aldridge (3.1 in 3 years)
* Yao Ming, Michael Finley and Joe Johnson share the distinction of only ever receiving a single 5th place vote in multiple years. 

**TL;DR -** Of players who never won an MVP in the last 20 years, Chris Paul and Dwight got the most votes. There's other stuff too. Thanks for reading.",0.98,hot,7/22/20 17:57
777,"[OC] Ahead of the re-start, lets look at where every team likes to shoot from (relative to league average)",330,hvv6ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvv6ua/oc_ahead_of_the_restart_lets_look_at_where_every/,99,1595458471,"tl;dr: [This chart shows how often each team shoots from the various parts of the court relative to league average. Darker areas indicate a higher amount of attempts from the corresponding area relative to the rest of the league.](https://imgur.com/UPAarqF)

***

[In this chart](https://imgur.com/UPAarqF), I show how often each team shoots from the different parts of the court, relative to league average. Darker areas on the court indicate a higher amount of volume from the corresponding area compared to the rest of the league. 

For example, take a look at the patch of dark red +30 feet from the hoop on the Atlanta Hawks chart. That means the Hawks (read: Trae Young) take more shots from that part of the court than any other team. 

Meanwhile, the Spurs have a blanket of black in the mid-range. Accordingly, they take more mid-range shots per game than anyone else (the next closest is Indiana).  

It's pretty easy to pick out certain players impact on their teams' shot selection 

* Melo's antiquated shot selection in Portland 
* CP3's signature elbow jumper 
* The pick and pop game of Brogdon and Sabonis in Indiana 
* AD's baseline jumper game in LA
* PJ Tucker and the rest of the Houston Rocket Corner Threes 

Note that blank areas show where a team shoots at or below league average volume. For example, the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets have almost no color in the mid-range because they take at or less than the league average number of attempts from that part of the court. A team like the Celtics takes roughly a league average number of attempts from almost all parts of the court, which is why their whole chart is mostly blank. 

*** 

**Methodology:**

I charted every shot taken this season (2019-20) and binned them into similarly sized hexagons. I then found out the league average number of attempts from each hexagon and calculated how many standard deviations away from the mean each team was from each hexagon. The darker the color on the chart, the higher the deviation. A team taking a league-average number of attempts from each location would have a blank chart.

778,Recreating the 2009 WCF Denver Nuggets team,39,hw5k60,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw5k60/recreating_the_2009_wcf_denver_nuggets_team/,38,1595492341,"I've seen some other recreations for the '04 Pistons, etc. but wanted to try my hand at one of my favorite teams of all time, the 2009 Denver Nuggets who reached the Western Conference Finals that season. Here goes:

STARTERS

PG: Chauncey Billups = **Kyle Lowry**. Two highly durable floor generals who can run an efficient offense, hit their shots, and operate with a pass-first mentality. Lowry is a bit more active on the boards, but their offensive game is extremely similar.

SG: Dahntay Jones = **Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot**. Jones was probably the weakest SGs the Nuggets have started over the last decade+, but was able to fill the starting lineup while J.R. Smith came off the bench. Jones was a bit more of a facilitator, but neither he nor Luwawu-Cabarrot were really asked to do much other than stand around with their hands open.

SF: Carmelo Anthony = **Pascal Siakam**. Both reliable offensive juggernauts and skilled No.1 options. Siakam is naturally more of a big, but Melo was beginning to rely more on his size at that point in his career and even showed flashes of his defensive capabilities (though there's really no comparison with Siakam's). Still, they're both elite scorers and strong rebounders, and while it's hard to make comparisons to players of Melo's caliber, I see a lot of similarities when I watch Siakam's one-on-one game (especially with the added mobility and range this year). Overall, the Lowry/Siakam combo reminds me a lot of Billups/Melo, and I think it works. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5\_2WDJe0Lo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5_2WDJe0Lo)

PF: Kenyon Martin = **Thaddeus Young.** Both 31-years old and declining, but still valuable on the defensive end. Kenyon Martin was great at getting into passing lanes and earning fast break opportunities similar to Young. K-Mart was more of a blocker in his day, but both players are good at cleaning up the glass and fulfilling their role.

C: Nenê = **Jaxson Hayes.** Sometimes overlooked by defenses, but about as solid offensively as you can get. Jaxson is much more mobile, but is also 7 years younger than '09 Nenê, and I could see him growing into that type of player as he adds more mass and experience (perhaps with a few more modern touches). Hayes is already a strong rebounder despite his lean frame and has shown flashes of Nenê's defensive versatility that will only improve as he learns to avoid fouls.

BENCH

J.R. Smith = **Bogdan Bogdanović**. Two deadly 3-pt snipers despite some streakiness. Bogdanović fills the same psuedo-6th man role on the Kings that J.R. filled on the '09 Nuggets, but when either one gets hot, they can take over the game. J.R. was a more aggressive offensive player, but both are decent facilitators as well.

Anthony Carter = **Rajon Rondo.** As above, both are 33-years old and are still valuable distributors and pass disruptors, but are often more liability than asset. Rondo seems to have lost some interest defensively (perhaps due to injuries), but you could do worse.

Linas Kleiza = **Jeff Green.** Green is already nearly a decade older than Kleiza was at this point, but their career trajectories meet pretty well in the middle. Green is really more of a defensive-minded 4 than Kleiza (who primarily played the 3), but both were decent catch-and-shoot options.

Chris Andersen = **JaVale McGee.** JaVale is probably the closest we have to Birdman in terms of monster blockers with generally underwhelming skillsets otherwise. McGee is more involved in the offensive scheme though, so he's not quite as strictly the defensive role player as Andersen was.

Renaldo Balkman = **Taj Gibson.** Gibson is a shell of his former self while Balkman was always kinda trash. He was actually a bit more of a craftier defender than Gibson is now, but I'm sure playing defense on the Knicks is just demoralizing, so I give Taj a pass here.

Johan Petro = **Dewayne Dedmon.** We traded for Petro halfway through the season (actually giving OKC the pick that became Taj Gibson) but he never really saw the floor too much. If he'd had a bit more of an opportunity, he probably would've looked similar to Dedmon (he's improved since moving back to Atlanta, but I'm still not sold. Don't forget he's nearly 31, too). Petro was a legit 7-footer like Dedmon, so he was able to catch a few rebounds, but didn't quite have Dedmon's defensive capabilities to be able to stick around in the league.

Jason Hart = **Frank Mason III.** Garbage time point guards that once showed some flashes but probably won't make it far in the league. Hart was able to use his size to some success defensively and they were both decent hustlers, but you really don't want them on the floor for long periods of time. Luckily Mason was able to take advantage of a two-way with Milwaulkee.

Anyway, let me know what you think of these comparisons. Taking ages and minutes into account, I think it's a decent looking team on paper, but how far would you see them going? Better or worse than the real deal Nuggets?",0.8,hot,7/23/20 1:19
779,"Biggest upset threat to the 3 favorites to win a title (Bucks, Clippers, Lakers)",18,hw8vyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw8vyi/biggest_upset_threat_to_the_3_favorites_to_win_a/,81,1595505736,"Who are the biggest upset threats to eliminate each team (other than each other). I'll leave my personal picks below and feel free to disagree.

Clippers: Its undoubtedly the Rockets, the Rockets stretch the floor out better than everyone and have been a matchup problem all year for the Clips. I think the Clips are really hard to beat on paper because this roster is unbelievable, but Houston's ability to score half their points on 3s is a terrifying thought, especially with their beefed perimeter defense against LACs stars

Bucks: I know their are Miami truthers, but I have to go Toronto. This team did it once and even though they don't have Kawhi, they have a new cutthroat star in Siakam. While Miami can stop Giannis, the goal of this series isn't to stop Giannis, it's to stop the Bucks and Miami just doesn't have the offensive firepower that Toronto does while still maintaining elite defense. The Raptors have an uphill battle to win this series but they have a punchers chance.

Lakers: I struggled most with this one because I think while the Lakers to me are the scariest team this year they also feel the most vulnerable. Since I already picked Houston I'll go with Denver. The Nuggets have size now, the only team in the West that can outsize the Lakers. I don't expect the Nuggets to run 3 centers but I think their height advantage and rim protection may be enough to slow AD and force the Lakers out to the 3pt line which is an area they aren't as comfortable in.


Im not saying these teams will win, but they're the just the biggest threats",0.72,hot,7/23/20 5:02

781,Thread I stole from twitter about the validity of some advanced stats.,14,hw8dr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw8dr1/thread_i_stole_from_twitter_about_the_validity_of/,19,1595503550,"According to BPM (OBPM, DBPM too)
which “estimates player contribution”,

Kobe (01-10) barely hooped at an All-NBA level (6.0 BPM is thought of as an All-NBA player, Kobe was at 5.7).

Stephen Curry from 2014-16 has a higher DBPM (1.5) than Gary Payton did from 1995-97 (1.2).

Klay Thompson since 2016 has a - 1.7 DBPM. For comparison, James Harden  (1.1), Kemba Walker (-0.5) and Damian Lillard (-0.6) were all apparently superior on defense. 

LeBron in 2009 was a better defender (3.7 DBPM) than Tim Duncan (3.3) and Ben Wallace (3.5) ever were.

Manu Ginobili in 2005 was as good as/better (6.9 BPM) than Michael Jordan in 1998 (6.9 BPM), Kevin Durant in 2019 (5.5 BPM), 2017 Steph Curry (6.9 BPM), 1984-86 Magic Johnson (6.7 BPM), and all but 2 seasons of Kobe Bryant’s 20 year career (5.9 or less).


Bruce Bowen from 2003-08 (his peak) apparently defended worse (1.6 DBPM) than current day Donte DiVincenzo (2.7 DBPM). While we’re on the subject of Donte, his current season is better (DBPM wise) than the best of Kobe’s, Payton’s, Wade’s, Kidd’s, Butler’s, and Holiday’s careers.

Horace Grant (11.4 BPM) apparently matched Michael Jordan’s brilliance (11.5 BPM) in G4 of the 93 Finals....or did he? 

Jordan: 55/8/4 on 61.2% 
Grant: 17/16/2 on 62.3% 

In last years Finals, Siakam’s 32/8/5 in G1 (17.7 BPM) was better than Curry’s 47/8/7 in G3 (17.2 BPM).

Moving on to VORP (basically how much better a player is than the worst player in the league). 

Harden in the 2018 playoffs (1.6 VORP) was about as good as Hakeem in the 1995 playoffs (1.7 VORP). 

Chris Paul from 2008-09 (19.2 VORP) > 2x MVP Tim Duncan from 2002-03 (15.7 VORP).

Kawhi’s 2019 playoff run (2.9 VORP) is as good as the best run Michael Jordan’s ever had (2.9 VORP in ‘92).

LeBron’s 17’ playoff run (33/9/7 on 65% in 18 games with a 2.2 VORP) was BARELY better than LeBron’s infamous 11’ playoff run (24/8/6 on 56% in 21 games with a 2.1 VORP).


1h
2019 Nikola Vucevic (5.5 VORP) is apparently better then any version of Steve Nash (peaked at 5.3), Dwight Howard (peaked at 5.4), and better than all of AI’s seasons except 2001. 

On to Win Shares (basically how many wins a player is responsible for). 

JaVale McGee (4.5 WS) is more valuable to the Lakers this year than Russ (4.3 WS) is to the Rockets. 

Based on his rankings in DWS and DBPM, Nikola Jokic is a top 10 defender this year..

In 2019 Russell Westbrook (5 DWS) was more valuable defensively to OKC than DPOY Finalist Paul George (4.9 DWS). 

These barely scratch the surface, there’s dozens more, but the point of this is: if advanced stats play a big role in your evaluation of players, ...Grimacing face 

From what I’ve gathered, the only advanced stat that’s good is multi-year RAPM. Efficiency stats like eFG% and TS% (my favorite) are good too.

782,[OC] Defining Defensive Success,15,hw85j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hw85j7/oc_defining_defensive_success/,0,1595502621,"I'm just an average Joe who really likes defense, and as such, I'm on a quest to clear up misconceptions about how defense works. In a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/h9srqd/quick_oc_have_defenses_really_gotten_worse/), I attempted to address idea that defenses have gotten worse over time by showing the leagues increase in offensive rating is mostly if not entirely explained by the increase in 3 point attempts and that, relative to offenses, defenses are as good as they've ever been.

This time I want to tackle the idea that ""good offense beats good defense"" or ""offense is more important than defense."" To be absolutely clear, I'm talking about *team* offense and *team* defense, and to compare the two, I'd have to be able directly compare what constitutes success for defense and how it compares to what constitutes success for offense. Let's start simple with defense, a defense is successful when they prevent the offense from scoring, this can be approximately calculated using this formula (all numbers are taken from NBA.com's per 100 possessions stats page):

(FGA - FGM - OFF REB) + TOV% + (100 + OFF REB - FGA - TOV%) x FT%^2.2

Basically, this formula calculates what percentage of the time the defense gains possession of the ball via either 1) a missed field goal attempt that does not result in an offensive rebound, 2) a turnover, or 3) a trip to the free throw line (not caused by an ""and 1"") and all free throws are missed. It's not a perfect formula, I have no way of tracking how often the offense keeps possession after a shot attempt because the ball goes out of bounds last touching a defender, or the actual average number of free throw attempts per trip to the line (I pulled 2.2 out of my butt), it also assumes all free throw shooters are average, but the number should be within an acceptable margin of error. When you plug in the numbers, you get that the defense was successful at keeping the offense from scoring this season...

#52.0% of the time!

Given the margin of error, I'm going to go ahead and round to an even 50%, which is actually incredible. This makes basketball one of the most balanced head to head sports in the world. This is in stark contrast to sports like soccer (sorry non-americans) where the success rate of an offensive possession is tiny because it requires winning several interactions in a row.

**But what about 3 pointers?** Ah yes, to decide how offense compares to defense, we don't need to just define defensive success, but how it compares to offensive success. Unfortunately, that's realistically impossible. Is a made 2 point field goal a successful possession when you could have scored 3? What about a single made free throw? Heck, the total potential point accumulation for a single possession is theoretically infinite due to mechanics like technicals and offensive rebounds from free throw attempts. This conundrum shows that the simple and objective measure of ""did the offense score or not"" fails to actually articulate if a possession was successful or not, teams do things like take lower percentage shots that yield higher point totals on average all the time. The only way to really tell if an offensive possession, and by extension, a defensive possession, is successful is *relatively*. This leads to an interesting problem though, league average offensive and defensive rating are the same number, if we're defining success relatively, then offense and defense will always be of equal value, after all, 1 more point for you has the same net value as 1 less point for the other team, which may sound like the most obvious statement in the world since it's the entire premise of net rating, but it basically means we'll never be able to call one more important than the other.

If you made it through all that, you're probably a nerd like me. I hope it was at least partially interesting. I look forward to the comments, both because I'm sure some of you will find flaws in my reasoning I didn't think of, but also because I find people who believe in the idea offense is inherently more valuable, even on a team level, absolutely hilarious. Next time I plan on tackling the idea *individual* offense is more important than *individual* defense, but that might take a while because that's got a kernal of truth in it.

Hope y'all are staying safe!",0.76,hot,7/23/20 4:10

Below is a table which includes the following variables: 

*  Comments -- the total number of comments made by the corresponding flair since the start of the 2019-20 season (2019-10-22)

* Fucks (per thousand) -- fucks divided by total comments multipled by 1000

787,If the Pistons get the 1st-3rd round pick in the draft they will be a good team next season,0,hwdflc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hwdflc/if_the_pistons_get_the_1st3rd_round_pick_in_the/,40,1595529500,"I know there are people out there who say they will rebuild but that may not be able to happen this season. Rose says he doesnt want to be traded so he wont be leaving. Blake has too big of a contract to be traded right now. He will most likely be tradable in the 2021-22 season, but not right now. I'd love to see a rebuild but it cant happen yet. 

They have a talented roster. They are better than all the awful teams in the east and better than the magic for sure. They're record wasnt only bad bc of blake and rose injuries. They also lost Luke Kennard who was having a great season. Reggie Jackson was also injured and then got traded. Blake also played 100% of his games this year while being injured. Theres no way he plays next season like he played this one. 

They got rid of Drummond so they could have room to resign wood. Christain Wood is better than Drummond at every aspect besides rebounding. He can score better, shoot 3s better and dunk better. He also shows potential on the defensive side of the ball. DR Doom is a work in progress but showed a lot of potential. He averaged more points per game than rookie Giannis. Still only 19. I'm not saying the pistons will win 55 games. That's impossible. But they arent as bad as everyone thinks they are. Could they get 50 wins? Maybe. It's possible. But if everyone gets injured again. But if everyone gets injured again.  Then yeah just tank and lose every game possible. 

The 2020-21 pistons have enough talent to be a decent team. They could surprise some people who have doubts. 40-50 wins is what they'll get. Even though I'd like to see atleast a partial rebuild, it just cant happen right away.",0.33,hot,7/23/20 11:38
788,The 2018 Draft was the first since 1984 in which all of the top five picks made the All-Rookie Team the next season,53,hvkyff,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvkyff/the_2018_draft_was_the_first_since_1984_in_which/,18,1595412134,"Apologies if this is common knowledge but I thought it was neat fact worth sharing

The 2018 draft was the first draft since 1984 — often considered the greatest draft in NBA history — in which all of the top five picks were selected for the NBA All-Rookie First Team the following season.

2018 Draft:

1. Deandre Ayton
2. Marvin Bagley III
3. Luka Dončić
4. Jaren Jackson Jr.
5. Trae Young

***

1984 Draft:

1. Hakeem Olajuwon
2. Sam Bowie
3. Michael Jordan
4. Sam Perkins
5. Charles Barkley

Perhaps a good omen for the 2018 class moving forward that it can be named alongside the 1984 class? Or perhaps a sign that only three of the top five will end up with Hall of Fame careers?

There were also a couple near-misses with the '91 and '92 draft classes (**bolded** names were voted to the All-Rookie First Team):

1991 Draft:

**1. Larry Johnson**

*2. Kenny Anderson*

**3. Billy Owens**

**4. Dikembe Mutombo**

**5. Steve Smith**

**Stacey Augmon**, drafted #9, rounded out the first team.
***

1992 Draft:

**1. Shaquille O'Neal**

**2. Alonzo Mourning**

**3. Christian Laettner**

*4. Jim Jackson*

**5. Laphonso Ellis**

**6. Tom Gugliotta**

Interestingly, Jim Jackson put up decent numbers in his rookie season and might've had a shot at getting voted to the first team. But he only played the final 28 games of the season due to a contract holdout. In his own words:

> So when I got drafted, and they tried to offer me a deal that was about what the eighth pick got. So Donald Carter came to Columbus in the big plane, and picked me up, and we were flying over Columbus, and he says, ‘Well Jimmy, I don’t think we should pay a guard this much money, because Randy White and Doug Smith didn’t really work out’

> “And I said, ‘Mr. Carter, no disrespect,’ I said, ‘But that’s not my fault that they didn’t work out.’ I said, ‘Now, I’m the fourth pick. I’m not going to ask for anything more, but I’m not going to take less than what my market value is

[Some interesting quotes from him on that holdout.](https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/mavericks/2014/01/26/ex-mav-jim-jackson-divulges-details-of-his-1992-holdout-explains-why-three-js-era-never-panned-out/)",0.95,hot,7/22/20 3:02

And they score at volume, all four of them, which means you can't really fully key-in on just one or two of them. Here's some numbers which highlight just how efficient they are:

&#x200B;

**FG% on shots at the rim:**  

CP3 - 86%

**Isolation scoring:**

CP3 - 67th percentile

SGA - 74th

Dennis - 79th

Gallo - 71st

&#x200B;

All four of them are above-average to elite at pretty much every single facet of offensive play. I wonder what it would take to neutralise such a potent offense. Obviously the defensive side of the floor is a whole different ball-game, but it seems like, in trading their two superstars, OKC may have (unintentionally) stumbled onto something unique here, something that feels and has proven to be sustainable over the course of a season.

792,The next star/notable player to request a trade,12,hvi8qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hvi8qm/the_next_starnotable_player_to_request_a_trade/,25,1595402137,"I was bored/curious and went through each team to figure out who the league's next ""He Gone"" guy is. I go through my thinking for each team, and give a ranking at the end. Obviously this is all speculation, so feel free to offer your own list.

 Two things:

1. I EXTREMELY stretched the definition of ""star""/""notable"" player for the sake of thoroughness

2. Despite what happened with Porzingus, I don't count people on Rookie contracts because they still have to become restricted free agents and thus have very little leverage (as far as I know, no player worth a max contract has ever taken their qualifying offer to get out of a place sooner)

**Pacific**

**Lakers:**AD could just walk this offseason if he really wanted, really can't see Lebron asking for a trade unless maybe they implode in the playoffs and AD walks (but again, that doesn't seem very likely)

**Clippers:** PG/Kawhi just got there and have player options in 21-22, so it would be more likely they leave than ask for a trade

**Warriors:** Curry seems happy, Klay/Dray just re-signed

**Kings:** Fox is on rookie deal, imo no one else fits the bill

**Suns:** Booker is signed through 23-24, with no player option, so he really doesn't have a lot of leverage 

**Northwest**

**Nuggets:** Jokic is signed through 22-23 and doesn't seem unhappy, Murray begins his 5 year deal next year

**OKC:** Whether CP3 wants out or not is not the issue with trading him lol, SGA is on a rookie deal

**Portland:** Dame/CJ just re-signed and don't seem to be unhappy

**Timberwolves:** Same as Booker, KAT is signed through 23-24 with no player option so he doesn't have a lot of leverage, also they just traded for his buddy D'Lo (who he himself is signed through 22-23)

**Jazz:** The team with the most ""He Gone"" buzz atm. Mitchell is an RFA so unless the team REALLY thinks he will take his QO (which no Max RFA has done before), he doesn't have leverage. However, Gobert has a year left and is in prime position to demand a trade (but there have been rumors, or at least speculation, that the Jazz would want to trade him rather than overpay him anyway)

**Southwest**

**Spurs:** This is assuming DeMar/LMA still count. DeMar has a PO and can walk if he wants. LMA has a year left and it's totally possible he asks for a trade if the team goes in a different direction next year, but he's not exactly a hot commodity at 35 years old and $24 mil

**Mavs:** Zinger just got there/signed, and Cuban is more likely to sell the team than he is to give into a Luka trade demand

**Grizz:** Ja/JJJ are on rookie contracts

**Pels:** BI is an RFA this off-season, and Zion has 0 leverage

**Rockets:** Maybeeee in 1-2 years if this duo isn't successful, but Westbrook/Harden are buddies and probably wouldn't want to break it off after 1 year even if it didn't go well in the playoffs this year. 

**Atlantic**

**Raptors:** Siakam is signed through 23-24, Lowry has 1 more year but they just won the title so he probably stays as long as the team will have him

**Celtics:** Kemba just signed, Brown just got extended, and Tatum is an RFA 

**76ers:** Horford seems unhappy, but he just signed and his contract isn't great so idk if they could even trade him. Harris also just re-signed (and his contract is also not awesome). Simmons is signed through 24-25, and embiid is signed through 22-23 but since there seems to be fit questions about the two together, I could see the team capitulating if one of them do request a trade.

**Nets:** KD/Kyrie just got there, but who knows with Kyrie lol

**Knicks:** RJ is a rookie, and uh, does Mitchell Robinson count?

**Central**

**Bucks:** Giannis is a tough case. The current team is built to his strengths well enough to have won the most games in the regular season two years in a row, and unless this playoffs is a total flame out, he probably will have confidence that next year they will be contenders as well. The only way I see him getting traded instead of walking on his own next year would be him being dead-set on the 5 year supermax for his next team (but everything Giannis has said till now makes it seem like he cares more about winning a championship than getting the absolute most money he possibly can), or there being a team that can offer a great package for him without gutting their team. For those reasons, I think it's more likely he stays one more year rather than request a trade. As for Middleton, his PO isn't until 23-24

**Bulls:** If Lavine counts, he could, but more likely Boylen get fired and Lavine gets to continue to be the man

**Pistons:** They want to trade Griffin lol

**Cavs:** Sexton still on rookie deal, no one wants to give up assets for Love

**Pacers:** Oladipo could request a trade but, with injury issues and one year left, he probably would just want to play out his deal normally to establish his value for the next contract. Sabonis/Turner are both signed for a while, but similar to Embiid/Simmons there are fit issues and the team would probably capitulate if one asked to be traded

**Southeast** 

**Heat:** Bam is RFA, Butler just signed there (and unlike his past two locations, specifically wanted to be here)

**Magic:** Vucci Mane signed til 22/23, Isaac RFA, Gordon is a legit possibility (and yes I'm REALLY stretching the definition of ""notable player"" here)

**Wiz:** Good luck moving Wall, Beal re-signed at the point people previously expected him to say ""get me outta here"" and seems to like being THE guy

**Hawks:** Trae is on rookie deal

**Hornets:** I apologize to Charlotte fans, but even I can't stretch the definitions that far

**Rankings** (based on likelihood, not skill)

1. Gobert

*gap*

2. LMA (If he counts)
3. Lavine (if Boylen isn't fired)
4. Sabonis or Turner
5. Giannis
6. Oladipo
7. Aaron Gordon (if he counts)

793,The results are in for: LEAST Valuable Player,5447,hukwu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/hukwu8/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/,703,1595279197,"The NBA league office announced that all awards will be officially based on play PRIOR to the bubble. With that, the cases are locked, the campaigns are closed, and the voting will begin.

While the media may focus on the MVP award and other prestigious honors, reddit has the distinct honor of awarding the LVP. **[The LEAST Valuable Player](https://images.app.goo.gl/jwXWsKEJUk6LQhNc6
)**. It's a tradition that dates back to 2016-17, when aging Indiana SG Monta Ellis won the inaugural trophy and then promptly disappeared from the NBA forever. In 2017-18, Minnesota SG [Jamal Crawford](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8ai7pl/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/?st=jsdf3cqi&sh=70ff7ca4) won the (dis)honor with some incredibly bad defensive numbers. Last season, New Orleans SF [Solomon Hill](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/b8xut2/the_results_are_in_for_least_valuable_player/) won LVP by helping to sink a drowning team and accelerating Anthony Davis' decision to fly the coop.  

Before we announce this year's winner, let's review the criteria and caveats:

--- Obviously, the worst players in the league are the ones who sit at the end of the bench and don't get any playing time. However, this award focuses on players who log a decent amount of minutes and consequently affected their team's play the most. Simply put: the more you play, the more damage you can do. 

--- And that actual ""damage"" is important. If you're on a tanking team, no one cares about your poor play; it may even be a positive. I'm also ignoring young players (under 21) who are still developing and can't be expected to be solid players yet. 

--- Similarly, we don't want to judge players within the context of their salary any more than the actual MVP does. We also do not weigh in injuries either. For example, the Wizards would have a hard time competing with John Wall on the sidelines (0 games played, $32M in salary), but we want to focus on players' on-court performance instead.

---

######**dishonorable mentions**

**PG Mike Conley, Utah: 28.6 minutes per game, -0.80 RPM**

We're using Mike Conley to reiterate that the LVP does NOT factor salary into the equation any more than the MVP does. But if it *did*, Mike Conley and his $33M salary may be in trouble. 

It was a disastrous start to the season for Conley. Playing in a new role as a second fiddle to another guard, he could never find his groove. His assists plummeted (down to 4.3 per game), his free-throw attempts cut in half (from 5.8 to 2.9), and he only shot 42.9% from two-point range. That said, he still shot pretty well from 3 (37.6%) and played OK defense, keeping him off our official ballot.

**SF Miles Bridges, Charlotte: 30.7 minutes per game, -2.68 RPM**

Like Mike Conley, Miles Bridges seems like a great guy whom you'd hate to criticize. Alas, that's our exercise here. Caught in between positions, Bridges hasn't been able to figure out his rhythm on offense in the NBA either. He hasn't shot well (33% from three, 48.6% from two) and doesn't get to the line enough (2.0 FTA) to make up for it. The advanced stats get even worse from there (although to be fair, they get dragged down by playing in a bad starting lineup.)

Fortunately for him, Bridges is spared by his youth. At 22, he's technically over our ""21 year old"" threshold, but it still feels unfair to pick on his growing pains as a sophomore. Perhaps in time, he can find a role that can take advantage of his athleticism and talent. But be warned: the clock is ticking. We're taking the kid gloves off soon. Bridges and fellow analytics-allergic Kevin Knox (-7.7 RPM!) will be entering Year 3 next season and will need to step their games up to avoid LVP discussion. 

**SF Kyle Kuzma, L.A. Lakers: 24.6 minutes per game, -0.74 RPM**

Kyle Kuzma can score if need be, but his skill set never made him a natural fit to play third banana to superstars like LeBron James and Anthony Davis. He's not a 3+D player -- he's more of a no-3 (30% this year) no-D player. At the same time, the LVP is about negative impact, and it's hard to find much of consequence here. After all, the Lakers still finished with the # 1 record in the West. Kuzma struggling to find his way is like a tree falling in the woods or a person farting in an empty elevator – ultimately it didn't matter.

**SF Andre Iguodala, Memphis/Miami**

It feels like ancient history now, but this past offseason, the Memphis Grizzlies acquired Andre Iguodala in a trade (under the presumption he may be dealt again.) According to official reports, Iguodala and the Grizzlies MUTUALLY decided that he wouldn't play for Memphis and wouldn't even report to the team in the meantime. Okay. Fine. We'll go along with that.

Still, that situation leaves a sour taste in the LVP headquarters. Memphis turned out to be better than expected, and could have used an extra rotational player. And even if Iguodala wouldn't have helped much on the court, he could have been a valuable mentor for their young kids. That's the least you can expect for a nice $15M in salary. 

---

######**our official top 5 LVP ballot**

**(5) PF Anthony Tolliver (POR, SAC, MEM): 15.6 minutes per game, -3.60 RPM**

I've always had a soft spot for the wise ol' owl, Anthony Tolliver. He's reportedly a great teammate and locker room presence. He also started to develop into an effective stretch four towards the end of this career.

But alas, the end of his career may have snuck up on us sooner than we expected. Tolliver disappointed for Minnesota last season, and completely flopped in his return to Portland. At age 34, he doesn't seem to be a viable rotation player anymore. He didn't play quite enough to merit LVP, but he still played more than he should have.

There's a chance Tolliver comes back next year to serve as a veteran mentor and pseudo-assistant coach somewhere, but it's more likely that he retires. If he does, he'll have played for 10 different franchises in his not-so-illustrious but very respectable career.

**(4) SG Bryn Forbes, San Antonio: 25.1 minutes per game, -0.95 RPM**

The NBA is all about shooting these days, and Bryn Forbes can shoot. He's hit an even 40.0% from three during his NBA career so far, and wasn't too far removed from that this season with 38.8% on 6.0 attempts per game. As a result, his true shooting percentage (57%) was above average. The Spurs lacked spacers, and Forbes fit that bill.

So what's the problem...? Turns out, basketball is more than a halfcourt game. And whenever the ball crosses that pesky midcourt line, Bryn Forbes starts to become a liability. 

At only 6'3"", Forbes is undersized to play the SG position, which is where the Spurs played him 74% of the time (according to basketball-reference.) Partly due to those athletic limitations, he only registered 0.5 steals per game, and blocked a grand total of 0 shots in his 1579 minutes of action. The advanced stats get ugly; Forbes ranks near the bottom at his position in DRPM, DBPM, all the alphabet formulas that you can cook up.

At the end of the day, LVP is about negative impact, and there's plenty here. Forbes is not a bad player in a vacuum, but he did not help the Spurs this year. In fact, their undersized lineup is a big reason why they're struggling so much on defense (25th in the NBA). As a direct result, they're on track to miss the playoffs for the first time in decades. 

**(3) SF Mario Hezonja, Portland: 16.3 minutes per game, -2.79 RPM**

During the entire run of the Damian Lillard - C.J. McCollum era, Portland has struggled to figure out their wing rotation. That would be tested even more this season, with familiar faces like Moe Harkless, Al-Farouq Aminu, and Evan Turner slipping out the door.
The trials and tribulations kept coming like Damian Lillard was Job, as injuries ravaged the Blazers' new depth chart. The team didn't need a star to emerge at forward -- but they needed [*somebody.* Anybody.](https://images.app.goo.gl/yzu1jBoNpAY3DiGC6)

In theory, that player should have been Mario Hezonja, a former lottery pick and a live body with good athleticism and size at 6'8"". Signed this summer for a modest price ($1.7M), Hezonja had the chance to jumpstart his NBA career with a major opportunity on the team. Instead, he flopped like Marcus Smart taking a phantom elbow.

Hezonja's biggest problem is that, at age 25, he still hasn't found his feel on the court. He's not a good shooter (32.8% from three), and doesn't use his athleticism to find his way to the line (1.1 attempts per game.) He was a non-factor (5 PPG, 3 RPG) on a team that desperately needed him to step up. In fact, the Blazers were so desperate for help that they not only signed Carmelo Anthony, but they played him over 32 minutes a game.

Again, we see a real ""LVP"" candidacy here with a direct effect on the standings. The Blazers' getting a big fat nothing from Hezonja was a major part of their struggle to get to .500 this season.

**(2) C Dewayne Dedmon, SAC/ATL: 17.6 minutes per game, -2.51 RPM**

We're not supposed to factor in salaries into this equation, but Dewayne Dedmon's situation merits a mention for context. The Sacramento Kings signed the big man to a head-scratching 3-year, $40M deal this summer (seriously.) Clearly, GM Vlade Divac thought his young Kings were only a few veterans away from making the playoffs, bringing in (and over-paying) Dedmon, Cory Joseph, and Trevor Ariza.

Among the three, Dedmon turned out to be the most disappointing for several reasons. He didn't play well to start the season, and got usurped in the rotation by underrated Richaun Holmes. Rather than suck it up, take a deep breath, and take a relaxing dive in his new Scrooge McDuck money pool, Dedmon started to whine and complain and push for a trade. For a team that was struggling, Dedmon's headache became the *last* thing they needed. Ultimately, they ditched him back to where he came from in Atlanta.

Now, being difficult and being a prima donna isn't enough to get you LVP honors. You have to stink on the court as well. And sure enough, Dedmon started to check those boxes. Billed as a stretch five after hitting some threes in Atlanta, Dedmon lost his shot in the SMF airport baggage claim. He shot only 19.7% from three for the Kings, registering a 47.3% true shooting percentage on the season. His defense is OK, but it's not good enough make up for his poor offensive play. He's not bad *enough* to get LVP, but he hurt his team this year.

**(1) PG Isaiah Thomas, Washington: 23.1 minutes per game, -2.75 RPM**

We've awarded three LVP trophies in the past, and a familiar pattern is starting to emerge. The most dangerous players aren't necessarily the *bad* players; they're the players who used to be *good.* Because of their prior success, they tend to get overplayed by their coaches and drag their teams down with them.

It wasn't too long ago that Isaiah Thomas found himself in the MVP conversation for the Boston Celtics, as his incredible shotmaking helped make up for any defensive limitations he may have as a 5'9"" player. That said, a small player like Thomas is always going to have a thin margin for error to remain a winning player. He needs to be GREAT offensively to make up for his defense. Unfortunately, his offense has not been great since his infamous injury. He can still make shots (hitting 41.3% of his threes), but he's not getting inside the paint and not getting to the free-throw line (1.9 attempts per game.) As a result, his true-shooting percentage lagged to 53.1%, well below league average.

If Isaiah Thomas isn't making scoring efficiently, then what is he doing to help a team win? He's not a great distributor (3.7 assists per game.) He's a very poor rebounder (1.7 per game.) And yes, that defense is still a major problem. According to ESPN's RPM metric, Thomas graded as a -4.2 impact per 100 possessions, the second worst in the league at PG after Trae Young. Basketball-reference lists his ""defensive rating"" at 121. For comparison's sake, the worst team defense in the league still held teams under 116. (That worst team? The Wizards.)

You can make an argument that there's still a place for Thomas in the NBA as a sparkplug scorer off the bench. Alas, that's not how the Wizards had been using him this season. He started 37 of 40 games for the team. Largely as a result of that, the Wizards' starting lineup was atrocious defensively. Fellow starters like Bradley Beal and Rui Hachimura ranked toward the bottom of their position in defensive metrics as well. When your lineup stinks defensively, a good coach may look in the mirror and say: hey, maybe we need a change here. Sadly, quick reactions are not Scottie Brooks' strong suit. He has the type of sloth-like speed that even frustrate workers at the DMV. The Wizards *eventually* dumped IT, but it took far too long to make that shift.

To be fair, the Wizards' options at point guard were limited with John Wall injured. Veteran Ish Smith is mediocre right now, and Shabazz Napier arrived late in the season. Still, the point here is: almost *any* competent point guard (like a Napier) would have helped the Wizards more than Isaiah Thomas. He had become a negative for them. The cold hard truth is that: it's very difficult to win basketball games with Thomas starting. And given that, he is our official **LVP.**",0.96,hot,7/20/20 14:06
