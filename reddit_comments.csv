3,I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.,89101,dt0ucg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/,4275,1573175984.0,"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\[CITY\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

“I believe no one person is capable of turning the tide, but we all have an obligation”

Like... dude

Edit: Forgot to mention that Lebron’s production company Springhill Entertainment helped produce and write the story for 2k20 - these are his own words

NBA players have been finding their voices, players like Dwight and Patty Mills have opted to donate salary, clearly there is no fear to speak out on important issues throughout a large portion of the league.

But now, when it comes to this, it is only silence. The way I see it, they either know it is wrong and choose to be silent, or they do not know that what he is doing is wrong, and both of these are incredibly disappointing. 

I’m a fan of all of these guys, I know Stephen Jackson is a good dude at heart from what everyone is saying, but this whole thing is making me rapidly lose respect for him and the players who are supporting him. I really can’t believe that after so many spoke out against Drew Brees, that not one player will openly condemn anti-Semitic comments and behaviours. 

If we don’t all look out for one another, there’ll be nobody left to look out for us... we’re all a family... the division Stephen Jackson is causing is the very thing he is against. I cannot believe that nobody has so much as tweeted about this. It really, really sucks to see.",2020-07-09 16:08:44

90,[OC] Charles Barkley's Secret: A Critical Analysis,31650,f3to7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/f3to7w/oc_charles_barkleys_secret_a_critical_analysis/,1083,1581722661.0," If you have ever had the chance to watch a basketball game on TNT, you might have caught yourself as glued to the half-time show as the actual game. *NBA on TNT* is one of the best sports broadcasts hosted by some of the boldest personalities on TV: Shaquille O’Neil, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and of course… Charles Barkley. 

There are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) 

As you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores.

 

[ google search results for generic query \\""San Antonio Women\\""](https://preview.redd.it/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)

From his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  


***But did you ever wonder why… Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***

  
***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***

So began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…

&#x200B;

# The Research

I started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… 

* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? 
* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and
* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?

Well let’s break it down one-by-one…

 

**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**

I compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…

[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)

As it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.

Interesting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.

[google trend statistics for search term \\""bbw\\""](https://preview.redd.it/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)

 *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*

 

**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**

Using [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.

[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)

Again, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).

I guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.

*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*

 

**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**

Tremendously, that’s how.

I literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros & Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!

Using cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\[CITY\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).

[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)

Well Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… 

&#x200B;

We have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?

&#x200B;

# The Analysis

With my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \*sniff\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.

Charles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…

&#x200B;

**‘The Biggest Loser’**

Between the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the ""*curious""* column.

* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)
* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)

 

[ W\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https://preview.redd.it/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)

Now I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.

&#x200B;

**‘My -25% Life’**

San Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:

* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg
* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg
* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg

Note: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\*FG)–(0.7\*FGA)–\[0.4\*(FTA-FT)\]+(0.7\*ORB)+(0.3\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\*AST)+(0.7\*BLK)–(0.4\*PF)-TOV*

Here’s what the analysis looks like:

[ Barkley performance analysis via heat mapping ](https://preview.redd.it/bm4bja82nwg41.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8908dd66fda7cb895c93a1f498644ed734988d1)

You can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.

Heat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*). 

 

[Barkley GmSc Variance in SA vs Season Avg](https://preview.redd.it/d7u0gmi4nwg41.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=2060d12d0604f038bcbb8c7a135b5a0b22ff9816)

These huge performance declines are damning. But what do they truly *tell us*?

&#x200B;

#  Conclusion

Well, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?

Every Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t hit free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.

For Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.

The Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).

The excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…

>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  
>  
>  
*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*

It is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. 

That’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**

**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™. In fact, it’s** ***great.***

99,Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:,30996,6cbgx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/6cbgx1/wilt_chamberlain_secretly_dominated_professional/,1490,1495329131.0,"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http://imgur.com/vNZZsm5)

Calculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:

* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)

* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)

* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)

* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league

[Image 4](http://i.imgur.com/BBnYsYc.jpg)

[Image 5](http://i.imgur.com/ecuUBnC.png)

Wilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, ""George Marcus"", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.

This is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.

*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!

*EDIT*

IMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http://www.bardown.com/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He ""only"" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!",2017-05-20 18:12:11

Methodology:

* On a spreadsheet, I copied a list of every NBA player ever from [https://stats.nba.com/players/list/?Historic=Y](https://NBA.com). 
* I went box score by box score through games Vince Carter played and crossed off players names who played in the same game as him
* Something important to note is that if someone was on the bench but did not play, then it did not count. 
* I did this for all 1541 games in Vinsanity's 21 seasons.

Here's a spreadsheet for all the players Vince has NOT played against:

As a former Quarterback he provided great insight as to what play the other team may or may not run, and why. He even predicted quite a few plays. 

What we get for nationally televised NBA games during the Conference Finals and NBA finals from Mark Jackson is nothing short of crap. Jackson offers no insight as a former point guard. Instead he spends most of the game poking fun at JVG and talking about absolute nonsense and quite frankly I’m sick of it. He distracts the fans and ruins the experience, especially when it’s a game when there’s so much on the line. ",2019-01-21 19:55:41

Context: Rachel asked Harden about Giannis' comment during the ASG selection when he picked Kemba over Harden because he wants someone who will actually pass. Harden replies that he averages more assists, but doesn't really pay mind to those comments.

Then he drops the not-so-subliminal bomb at Giannis saying he wishes he could just be 7 feet tall and run and dunk with no skill.  The cold war that has been simmering since last season between Harden and Giannis is officially a real thing now.

So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.

#Calls going against Rockets:

1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.

2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.

3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.

4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).

5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)

6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)

7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)

8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.

#Calls going against Warriors:

1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.

2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

205,How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets.,24923,4e8ikq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4e8ikq/how_my_nba_experience_turned_into_a_nightmare/,1360,1460365294.0,"**4/11 - Here is an update since I don't think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me.**
___________________________________

StubHub has reached out to me and advised me that, in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats, they will get me tickets to the home opener next year.

The rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation. I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.
I'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.
__________________________________



**TL:DR – StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) – they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**
_______________

Let me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.

I am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of… everything.  We don’t have much.  We haven’t been to the playoffs in 10 years – the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.

I’ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building – Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  

The entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena – tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don’t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It’s the only real arena we have ever had – we don’t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  

It is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a “cow town” – unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.

After all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team – Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.

With that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the “old barn” after 28 years.

I was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources – Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others – Craigslist comes to mind.  

I would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub – I’ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.

Unfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.
 
Yesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 – expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  

The Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures – it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.

I [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.

We arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I’ve ever seen it.

We made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn’t register so I tried again.  REFUND.

At this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed – like I was some scammer or didn’t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  

I pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  

The door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, “I’m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can’t help you – you need to call them but they’re very good at refunds.”

REFUND.  There’s that word again.  

I don’t want a refund – I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, “all of our representatives are assisting other callers – we will be with you shortly.”

I am basically beside myself by now – I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets – plus fees.  

I can’t believe what I am hearing.  I still don’t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.

I don’t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, “man, I’m so sorry – we’ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.”

7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm

By 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line – after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.

He was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, “Did the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.”  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.

I couldn’t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game – this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That’s when he dropped the bomb on me.

He said, and I quote, **“I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.”**

So there it is – StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  

He told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn’t then, and it’s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.

We went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot – with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn’t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.

The final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their “guarantee” to get you in the game.  I couldn’t believe it.  

As soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, “oh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.”  I knew I got my refund last night!  

I asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, “No I don’t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It’s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.”  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I’m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.

A couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  

I have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:

* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?

* Why does StubHub not warn it’s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?

* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn’t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.

- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.

* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative’s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.

Here is StubHub’s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):

**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**

* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*

* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*

* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*

*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*


I was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.


I apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this.",2016-04-11 02:01:34

Toronto's Childrens Hospital is Sick Kids Hospital - https://www.sickkids.ca/

I've cross posted this to both /r/torontoraptors and /r/lakers as well to get more eyes on it.

FINAL EDIT: 

So this is a turn of events. Clippers got him. I honestly thought they weren't really in the running anymore and it was a toss up between Lakers and Raptors. As I've said in comments I never meant any disrespect to Clippers fans and congrats to them! When they were brought up I really didn't know how to do a 3 way deal between 2 cities. Now that here here though...

The spirit of the wager was the winning team donates to the other teams kids hospital. Clippes fans have wanted to be in this so much I'm hoping now they step up. I'd suggest donating to either city's kids hospital. You want to keep your donation local give to CHLA, want to show Toronto some love give to Sick Kids in Toronto. for Lakes and Raptors fans I'm suggesting they each give to the other charity. As a Raptors fan I'm still going to give to CHLA. There is no reason not to in my mind.

I'm glad my post could bring people together in a positive way and I know some good has come out of it.

They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.

* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.

* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.

* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.

* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.

* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.

* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.

* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.

* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.

* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.

* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.

* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.

249,Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night,23529,bowigy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bowigy/rachel_nichols_and_the_espn_crew_were_extremely/,2420,1557946856.0,"I’m not sure if this has been posted by someone already, but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams, save for maybe the Knicks, to all of the other draft picks, and to the Pelicans. Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. 

First off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don’t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.

Then, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as “who gets Zion.” Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it’s only going to Zion?

And finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team’s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an “asset” to trade for AD. I’m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.

Now I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said “no.”

EDIT: Apparently, there are rumors circulating that Rachel Nichols was drunk. Honestly...that’s not surprising",2019-05-15 12:00:56

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

LeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it’s more convenient than moving to a different city.

**Dallas Mavericks**

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Miami Heat**

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

LeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron’s favorite song “Super Freak”

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

LeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

LeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.

**Sacramento Kings**

LeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that’s where he belongs.

**San Antonio Spurs**

LeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he’s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

**Utah Jazz**

LeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don’t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.

LeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.

Justice is served! Josh reach out and sent me this.
Thank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!

Back in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.
He made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.
The conversation went as follows:

 http://imgur.com/gallery/WkSFMJm

We agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.

He did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.

That was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.

I have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.

So please Josh....just pay up bro.

I’m amazed and shocked by this. For those who don’t know, [DeSean Jackson posted a quote from Hitler](https://imgur.com/gallery/gSb7eyd) (edit- now said to be Farrakhan but written as Hitler) last night on his Instagram. Stephen Jackson replied with [this video today](https://streamable.com/yk2vur) about the whole situation, saying Jackson was “speaking the truth” and trying to get educated. The comments of the post also encourage the same “Jews control everything” hate that have fueled terrors of the past, with [Stephen Jackson even replying to one of them.](https://imgur.com/a/7YFggCE?fbclid=IwAR325lH10U5judJVIOxr3o3Ay-OUV6k7muLRgMCYMTzQxkoNVZPS58Cy-uI)

I’m extremely disappointed by Stephen Jackson (who has been a face of BLM) as well as this not getting traction in the media yet and even getting removed here. We say we are anti-hate but we can’t have double standards when we do so.

**EDIT-** Stephen Jackson deleted the video and has posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCXdZpzlVEf/), basically doubling down on his comments with a follow-up just as infuriating as the first post. He has seen a bit of backlash on IG (and some praise) but this should really be a bigger story given his platform and following. **How is it getting almost no traction in the NBA world?** The majority of the responses to this thread here have been really encouraging to see, and to the people commenting “Well, Jews do run everything”… I urge you to read about how dangerous this notion has been in history, particularly in the context of the Holocaust.

We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality. To honor our Team Mamba family, the Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the MambaOnThree Fund to help support the other families affected by this tragedy. To donate, please go to MambaOnThree.org.

He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.

&nbsp;

However, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.

&nbsp;

I realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. 

&nbsp;

The public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.

&nbsp;

People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.

&nbsp;

>""A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.""

&nbsp;

>""The support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done.""

&nbsp;

>""I have 2 young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard. Which I do. I hold myself to a high, high standard.""

&nbsp;

These are all quotes from Kyle Lowry. The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. 

&nbsp;

This was one of his quotes on that day:

>""B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!""

&nbsp;

He then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. 

&nbsp;

If Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?

&nbsp;

In August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. 

&nbsp;

Two years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.

&nbsp;

He went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. 

&nbsp;

At the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. 

&nbsp;

I was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.

&nbsp;

OJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to ""drugs of abuse"" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.

&nbsp;

Jason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.

&nbsp;

Darren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.

&nbsp;

I'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA.

Look bitch, I'm gonna cut it straight.  I don't have a fancy pitch like the rest of these teams.  I'm just gonna be real.  We're desperate dude. The troops are low on morale and I don't think they'll survive another winter like this.  I know we don't have much, but I'm gonna try to at least show you what we have.  Any help will do.  We'll even take Bronny Jr.  Right now.

1. **We've got young meat who will do literally whatever you say.** -  We've got a lot of talent, and absolutely no ego whatsoever. We're the South Central Louisiana State Mud Dogs of the NBA. You can make the rest of the team wash your feet between quarters and they'd do it.  This will be a drama free zone.  You're the king and they are your squires.  But like, please don't abuse this power and sell anyone into human trafficking rings or anything.  I know Evan's got a pretty mouth but don't okay

2.  **Orlando is a trash city just like Cleveland** - Look, you're an Ohio boy through and through.  You'd hate Los Angeles.  Buncha liberal hippies with their ""activated charcoal"" and their ""functioning state government"" and all that other PC nonsense.  You dont need that in your life.  Plus those taxes are you kidding me?  Nobody in Florida pays taxes.  If you can prove to the state that you're physically capable of tackling a gator, you don't have to pay state taxes.

3. **We're about as physically far away from Golden State as you can get.**
 
4. **...""But what about Miami?""** - Miami can eat my ass.  You've already been there Bron.  They're gonna expect 2010 Bron and when father time eventually catches up with you in 2050 they're gonna riot and start calling you names in spanish.  You don't want that kinda stress in your life.  Anybody who would call you names in spanish lives far away in Kissimmee.  We will protect you.

5. **The kids love Disney** - You're a family man now Bron.  Think about the kids.  I mean who wouldn't love all year access to Disney World?  Who doesn't love 10 dollar bottles of water and roaving hoardes of Brazilian teens yelling at birds and stuff?  It's great for the whole family.

336,Carmelo Anthony was never a top 5 player.

I've *always* hated melo's game. 

What follows is me trying to illustrate that not only was Melo not a top 5 player *of his era*, he was never a top 5 player at all.  Not even fucking once. I'm doing this for me.

### Melo, at a glance
* only twice made it out of the first round
* 215th all-time in ws/48, tied with Corey Maggette
* not in top 250 for career TS%
* not in top 250 for career Offensive Rating
* made up for this relative inefficiency by not passing much or trying on defense
* [tried to combat questions about work ethic by posting video of himself jogging](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWCHXsYDoXx/?utm_source=ig_embed)

#### The Most Overated Player of his Era

Anthony has made 10 all-star games, and was often cited  as a top 5 player.

Carmelo's net offensive and defensive rating are the exactly the same (108). That means he's giving up a lot of what he gives you. And 108, as mentioned above, isn't anything special.  [Here is the full list of players who have made at least 3 all-star games with Carmelo's defensive rating or worse, capped at Melo's offensive rating.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=combined&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=3&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=def_rtg&c1comp=gt&c1val=108&c2stat=off_rtg&c2comp=lt&c2val=108&order_by=ws)

###Melo in Denver 
""Melo was actually good in denver!"" Sure!  ""Melo was a top 5 player in denver!"" [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DCJXYbBB7w) While more dynamic than his plodding, interminably jab-stepping, Knicks iteration, he was never actually a top 5 player. He only made it out of the first round once.
 
####First: Melo has never been better than LeBron. 
Lebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on.

####Second: Denver Melo was  *never* better than Kobe or Dirk
From 2005-2012, there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk. Melo *never* finishes above these guys in all-nba over this period. Not once. More importantly, with the benefit of retrospect, we can see these two (along with LeBron) were great every season, always healthy, and whenever they had *any* talent around them, contended for titles/MVPs. They got everything out of their team, year after year. There's not a single season you wouldn't trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver.  (To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in 2009, when he beat the Mavs in the second round: Dirk averaged 34/12/4 on 53/38/92 shooting in that series--if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team, they would've been even better. Dirk was also 1st team All-Nba to Melo's 3rd. Melo also didn't even make the all-star team.)

So: Melo is at best, the 4th best player any season from 2005-2012. I now just have to establish that there were at least *2* other guys who were better each season during that period, and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top 5 rankings.

#### Numbers 4, 5, 6 
Here i'm going to list three players (in any order), that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season. Why three, when I only need two? Because fuck Melo. Honestly, in a lot of these seasons I could list ~10+ players. Finally, just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they're no longer better than Melo--they probably are--it's just that there are 3 more inarguable players. 

##### 2005-2011

Duncan | Duncan | Duncan | CP3 | CP3 | Durant | Durant
Shaq | Wade | Wade | Garnett | Wade | Wade | Wade



### Melo in New York
Unlike his team USA compatriots, Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam, instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks. While not as athletic as Denver Melo, it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter. It's also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games. He won *one* playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks. In the east, guys.

And then it got worse. Knicks Melo never made the playoffs, let alone an all-nba team after 2013, so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top 5 purposes. Just because people still *thought* he was good, I went all the way to 2015, where became pretty clear he's wasnt even top 15 anymore. Kobe and Dirk start declining here, so I expanded it to **4** players besides LeBron. Still wasnt very hard. Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non-Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo.

As a sidenote: the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in 3 of the next 4 seasons (including 57 in 2012), and only finished behind in 2014 by 1 game (37 to 36).

Durant | Durant | Durant | Durant |

Dwight | M.Gasol | Harden | Harden |

##### 2013: The year Melo might have been top 5
Ok, even I have to admit this. In 2013, Melo has a decent case for his only top 5 season. He leads the league in scoring, shoots a good percentage, and even wins a playoff series. It's by far his best season as a Knick, and likely, the best season of his career. He has a career high in ws/48, with .184, and finishes 9th overall in offensive win shares (really high for him).

Melo also finishes 3rd in MVP voting, and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time (and being in NYC), he did have a great year. 

Still though: LeBron, Durant, clearly better. CP3 has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference.  Tim Duncan makes 1st team all-nba, and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals. Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year, wins more games, and goes to the western conference finals. He finishes *3rd* in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant. It's counter-intuitive, but Gasol has a really strong argument. That's 5, but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation, and honestly, I'd take either of them over Melo in 2013. That's 7. 

Maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe Melo was top 5 in 2013. But that would be his *one* year as a top 5 player. One very debatable season. The next year he misses the playoffs and falls out of the conversation forever.

The shitposts were posted by nephews with care, 
in hopes that sweet upvotes soon would be there,

The Canadians were nestled all snug at Tim Hortons, visions of Nav dancing, they cried out “oh Board Man” 

And Magic in LA and Ballmer there too,
They’d just calmed the hell down, which was long over due.

When all of a sudden there arose a new tweet, 
People sprang to hit new, to see who had who beat. 

Away to their phones they flew like a flash
They smashed on f5, and prayed the whole internet didn’t crash.

Lebron sees his chance of a new superteam grow, 
But ask him if it is one and I’m sure he’ll say no,

When what to our wondering eyes should appear,
Why a brand new post right there in the clear,

With a little bold writer, so lively and quick,
I knew in that moment a woj bomb I did click,

More rapid than raptors his words they came,
And he stayed very silent, his sources he never names,

Now SIMMONS, now SHAMS, now SKIP and SHANNON, 
on RDA, on Masai, on Windhorst and JALEN,

To the top of the window! To the Top of r/all!
The excitement’s so palpable there’s sweat on my balls. 

As band wagoners that before a big trade trade fly,
When someone calls out their flair switch, they say “bye bitch, bye.”

False alarm?! Yes sadly, Woj did have some news,
about the Greek freak?!... YES! but just about his new shoes,

They sprang to their helicopter, the cameramen they did go, 
And away they all flew to a car, #tbt to that white bronco. 

But I heard the Klaw say as he drove out of sight,
He.He.He. Indubitably, Happy Kawhismas to all, and to r/all good night!",2019-07-04 02:28:04

378,I sold Josh Hart a Nintendo Switch in 2017. And he has paid me back,20175,collc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/collc1/i_sold_josh_hart_a_nintendo_switch_in_2017_and_he/,1015,1565490032.0,"A few months ago I posted about my situation with now former Los Angeles Lakers Guard, Josh Hart. If your not familiar with the story, [here it is](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/brvala/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

I never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.

July 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c134ht/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.

[He sent me a box in the mail.](https://imgur.com/a/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.

Being a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.

If there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.

Edit: Apologies if I came off as asking for more. That was not my intention whatsoever. I could've made a better choice of words, but I don't expect anymore. I could've done without the smash Bros comment, but I wasn't asking for more. I got more than I asked for.",2019-08-10 19:20:32

**Transcript:**

>**I'm numb to this commentary, like! Must they run their mouths like that? Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids. This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid a hundred million dollars a year to bounce a ball. Oh and LeBron and Kevin? You're great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, ""shut up and dribble"".**

485,"Not enough is made of the fact that LeBron got Kevin Love to join him in Cleveland and commit long-term, but then LeBron himself didn't commit long-term and routinely undercut Love in one way or another. And through all that Love never complained once and appreciated everything.",18655,8yyx4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8yyx4f/not_enough_is_made_of_the_fact_that_lebron_got/,1420,1531654541.0,"Kevin Love changed his game more than anyone to adapt to playing with LeBron. He also bore the brunt of LeBron's frustrations during his Cavs tenure with indirect jabs and rumors of trades involving Love.

This is a summary of how Brian Windhorst described it on The Lowe Post:

> Kyrie Irving ""opted out of what Love is dealing with,"" Windhorst said. ""Love deals with the persecution of being a LeBron teammate, of being blamed, of dealing with his social-media undercutting, of being the fall guy, as he's called himself.""

> He added: ""There have been so many days and nights where Kevin Love has walked out of a building feeling beleaguered or beaten down either directly because of LeBron"" or indirectly.

> But Windhorst says Love insists that it's all worth it because playing with James also means playing late into the season and competing for championships.

> ""I have to give Kevin a real major hat tip for being a professional and being an adult about it,"" Windhorst said. ""He has always seen the big picture ... He has always maintained that this is all worth it, that playing in these late games — I mean, this is a guy who played for six years, whatever it was, never sniffed the playoffs. He's like: 'This is where I'm at right now. This is the charge for playing with [James].'"" 

For fuck's sake, Kevin Love literally developed anxiety and stress to the point of having panic attacks and you have to think some of that was due to the pressure of playing with LeBron.

Despite all that LeBron to the very end never seemed to appreciate what Love went through for him. When he signed with the Lakers, Love found out from a notification and HE called LeBron to tell him he loved him.

Man, I just really admire Kevin Love and his strength and big heart in the face of what he puts up with.
